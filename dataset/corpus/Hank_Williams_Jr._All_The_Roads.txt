I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by  
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord!  
And then I jumped in the river, but the river was dry.  
  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.  
  
I had me a man who couldn't be true.  
He made me for my money and she made me blue.  
A woman needs a man that he can lean on,  
But my leanin' post is done left and gone.  
  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.  
  
I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice.  
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, Oh Lord!  
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice.  
  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.  
  
He told me on Sunday he was checkin' me out,  
Long about Monday he was nowhere about.  
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news.  
I got them gone but not forgotten blues.  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.
