And when the day is done  
I'll find you woman, and run,  
Don't ask no question.  
And you won't get no lies,  
And if you steal away,  
I'll be your only lover.  
And I will love you till the day that I die.  
  
And if you steal away,  
I'll turn your night into day  
And get you crying like a dog for a bone.  
And if you say you will,  
I'll be your only lover.  
And if you're good,  
I'll never leave you alone.  
  
Now, woman, don't be shy,  
I see that look in your eye,  
A little snake-bite won't do nobody wrong.  
And if you shake what you got  
I'll be your only lover,  
And I'll be howling for you all night long.  
  
Steal away, steal away,  
Steal away, steal away.  
  
And if you steal away,  
I'll turn your night into day  
Don't ask no question,  
And you won't get no lies.  
And if you say you will,  
I'll be your only lover.  
And I will love you  
'Til the day that I die.
