Why don't you come clean, baby  
I know what you're goin' through  
You must think I'm some kind of crazy  
Well, honey I'm just worried 'bout you.  
  
You look so much like your mama  
And I'm sorry for you that she's gone  
And if she was here she sould tell ya  
Don't lose sight of what's right or what's wrong.  
  
'Cause you ain't foolin' nobody  
'Cause baby, the talk gets around  
You ain't foolin' nobody  
'Cause you're lovin' in this one horse town.  
  
Well, I hope your conscience is listening  
When you're out runnin' at night  
All it takes is one bad decision  
To haunt you the rest of your life.  
  
'Cause you ain't foolin' nobody  
'Cause baby, the talk gets around  
You ain't foolin' nobody  
'Cause you're lovin' in this one horse town.  
  
'Cause you ain't foolin' nobody  
'Cause baby, the talk gets around  
You ain't foolin' nobody  
'Cause you're lovin' in this one horse town...
