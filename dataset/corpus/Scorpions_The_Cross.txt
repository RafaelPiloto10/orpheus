Hey, do you remember me  
I finally found the strength to face  
The pain you made me feel  
I always held my tongue  
And all the things you've done to me  
Are secrets to reveal  
  
I'll never let you do this to someone else  
No I could never live with myself  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked games  
With the mask you're wearing  
And now you gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
I'll nail you to the cross  
The cross I'm bearing  
  
You, you said you'd save my soul  
And sacrificed the innocence  
That I will never know  
Now it's time that you confess  
They say the devil doesn't rest  
Until the truth is told  
  
I'll never let you do this to someone else  
No I could never live with myself  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked games  
With the mask you're wearing  
And now you gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
I'll nail you to the cross  
The cross I'm bearing  
The cross I'm bearing  
  
I believed in love  
I believed in trust  
I believed in you  
You became my God  
I believed in love  
I believed in trust  
  
I was young and so naive  
You were God and I believed  
You made me kneel  
You made me feel  
Like it was all my fault  
But now I know it wasn't mine at all  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked game  
You gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
You held me down in chains  
And made me take the blame  
I'll nail you to the cross
