My sweet darling night  
How the city swings  
A little kiss of angels  
A little tune of things  
And she mesmerizes,  
captivates  
A message for  
a heart that aches  
now you are 16  
and your stuck in jail  
18 plus  
there's no sign of bail  
And she mesmerizes,  
captivates  
A message for  
a heart that aches  
My thousand dollars  
ain't going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss, tell, and dare  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
21 is easy,  
but I don't know why  
There's no difference  
this bird will fly  
My thousand dollars  
ain't going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss, tell, and dare  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
Solo  
And she mesmerizes,  
captivates  
A message for a  
heart that aches  
My sweet darling night  
How the city swings  
A little kiss of angels  
A little tune of things  
My thousand dollars  
ain't going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss, tell, and dare  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I really want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
Perfect view  
I've got a perfect view
