Every night I get tired eyes  
  
My feet don't reach the ground  
  
Then I'm with you  
  
I get by 'cause I know that you're near me  
  
So baby close your eyes  
  
I can sleep tonight  
  
All because of you  
  
  
  
Every night when the fire flies  
  
The walls come tumblin' down at the Bajou  
  
I get by 'cause I know that you're near me  
  
So baby close your eyes  
  
I can sleep tonight  
  
All because of you  
  
  
  
I'll keep singin' my love song  
  
In my mind I'll sing a song for you  
  
You can see through the music  
  
That's in my mind  
  
So baby close your eyes  
  
I can sleep tonight  
  
All because of you  
  
All because of you  
  
All because of you
