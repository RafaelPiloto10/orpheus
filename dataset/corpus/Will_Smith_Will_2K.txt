Its here and I like it  
  
Whoo! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!  
Big Will, uh K-Ci y'all bringing it in  
What?  
  
Its here and I like it  
(Say what? What?)  
(Say what? What?)  
Gonna pack the dance floor  
(And do what with it?)  
Rock the dance floor  
  
Here it comes the party of a lifetime  
31st of December  
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90  
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me  
What's gonna happen?  
Don't nobody know  
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0  
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street  
Man who the hell cares?  
Just don't stop the beat  
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight  
K-C you feeling me right? (Yeah)  
2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K  
The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium (yeah)  
It can't get thicker than this (Big Will)  
Slick like Rick I can't miss  
(And we gonna party like it's 19)  
Hold up it is  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
There's a party tonight  
Everybody was drinking  
The house was screaming  
And the bass was shaking  
And it won't be long  
Till everybody knowing  
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing  
Drinks on me, up the cups, and  
Midnight coming full thrust, and  
Dick Clark holding it down, and  
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)  
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press  
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess  
Same resolution, get the money  
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be  
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne  
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find  
First soul train line of the year  
Four, three, two, one  
  
Its here and I like it  
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)  
Gonna pack the dance floor  
(And do what with it?)  
Rock the dance floor  
(Uh, uh, uh)  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
Say yeah, yeah  
(Come on)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(I can't hear y'all)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(What? What? What?)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(Come on, come on)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(I can't hear y'all)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(I can't hear y'all)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(Ha-ha-ha)  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I remember trying to count how old I'd be  
When the clock struck twelve in the year two g  
Medianoche finally near  
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers  
Just the man to usher it in  
Big Will bringing the heat  
K-Ci bringing the plan  
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop  
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock  
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts  
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart  
May the future hold more joy then pain  
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain  
  
Its here and I like it  
Gonna pack the dance floor  
Rock the dance floor  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
There's a party tonight  
Everybody was drinking  
The house was screaming  
And the bass was shaking  
And it won't be long  
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock  
At 12 o'clock  
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?  
  
Here it comes another year  
Come on everyone, new millennium  
Here it comes another year  
Everyone, new millennium  
  
True dat, true dat, true dat  
Yo London, uh come on  
Yo Bangkok, come on, come on  
LA, ha, ha  
The NYC  
Come on, say what? Say what?  
Yo Philly, come on, hey  
Hey Tokyo, come on  
Everybody say what now  
Say what now, saw what now  
Come on, come on, come on
