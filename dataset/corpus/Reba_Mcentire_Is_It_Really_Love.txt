They say that it's the same the whole world over  
That love's the hardest thing to understand  
I thought once in love my troubles would blow over  
But it seems that's when the heartache just begins  
  
And I remember when you first said that you love me  
I tried not to let the words go to my head  
The things you said you spoke so sincerely  
Somewhere in between the lines of red  
  
Is it really love  
Is it really love  
Or just my heart playing tricks on me  
I fall so easily  
Is my heart telling me  
That I'm your fool  
Or is it really love  
  
This time love's got me feeling so uncertain  
My heart's seen all the breaks that it can take  
I can't tell you if this is just infatuation  
Or another chance to learn from my mistakes  
  
Is it really love  
Is it really love  
Or just my heart playing tricks on me  
I fall so easily  
Is my heart telling me  
That I'm your fool  
Or is it really love  
  
I'm a little bit leary  
Of the love 'em and leave 'em behind kind  
I'm just a little bit weary  
Cause other lovers like messing with my mind  
Oh all the time  
  
Is it really love  
Is it really love  
Or just my heart playing tricks on me  
I fall so easily  
Is my heart telling me  
That I'm your fool  
Or is it really love  
  
Am I your fool  
Or is it really love
