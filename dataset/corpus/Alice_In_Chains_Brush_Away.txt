I could use some time to curl away  
My aggression is where you stake your claim  
Why I question this curve on which you grade  
My conception, a joke or latest craze?  
I try to get away, and yet I stick around  
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground  
  
My intention, may I arrive at eight?  
Lie and dream some, surprise you guys I'm late  
All right, correction, forgetting something, wait  
I try to get away, and yet I stick around (2x)  
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground  
Brush away loose ground  
Brush away
