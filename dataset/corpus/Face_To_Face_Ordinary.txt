Now you've made it up  
It's all inside your mind  
Now you've given up  
You don't know what's there if you don't try  
So you've given in along with all your friends  
And you're still alone  
The means don't always justify the end  
  
Ordinary, ordinary  
A look in the mirror is not enough  
What makes you think that you're not one of us?  
  
If you make it up and start to use your mind  
It isn't difficult  
You don't know what's there if you don't try
