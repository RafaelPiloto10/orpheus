Born to lose I've lived my life in vein  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear  
How I long to always have you near  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose my every hope is gone  
It's so hard to face an empty dawn  
You were all the happiness I knew  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
