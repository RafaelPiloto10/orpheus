Twenty-four hours of the day  
You're on my trail  
And I can't get away  
I can't shake you off  
You're a wolf on the prowl  
You got my scent and I can hear you howl  
  
No where to run  
No where to hide  
No where to go  
No where to run to  
No where to hide this hurt inside  
  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
  
When the sun goes down,  
I can feel your heat  
Till the sun comes up  
When you've got me worn deadbeat  
I said I'm all burned out  
I'm a physical wreck  
But there you go again with your  
Hot breath on my neck.  
  
No where to run  
No where to hide  
No where to go  
No where to run to  
No where to hide this hurt inside  
  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
  
No where to run  
No where to run  
No where to run to  
No where to run  
  
No where to run  
No where to hide  
No where to go  
No where to run to  
No where to hide this hurt inside  
  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Oh baby hot for love  
Yes you're hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love
