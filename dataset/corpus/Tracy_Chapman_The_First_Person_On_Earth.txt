From the water  
From the rock and the dirt  
You were  
The first person on earth  
  
Oh the mountains  
And the oceans  
Witnessed your birth  
The first person on earth  
  
By a river  
On the banks of a sandy shore  
Untouched clean fresh and pure  
The first person on earth  
  
In the light of the sun  
You emerged  
To see the good in the world  
Before the pain and the scourge  
The first person on earth  
  
In the quiet in the calm  
Before the storm  
You heard the dream for a love  
That never dies in a poem  
The first person on earth  
  
And I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with a dream  
That can not be realized  
Held or seen  
By the last person on earth  
  
After the earthquakes the hurricanes  
The fires and floods  
I'm jaded cynical angry and glum  
The worlds too absurd and obscene  
For true love  
And more than happy to let me become  
The last person on earth  
  
To let me stand on a rock  
The muddy waters surround  
Abandoned alone  
The end soon to come  
As the last person on earth  
  
As the waters rise  
At the end of the world  
Thought I bear the weight  
Of the rock and the dirt  
I know I'm worthy of your love  
As the last person on the earth  
  
As the water rise  
At the end of the world  
Thought I bear the weight  
Of the rock and the dirt  
I know I'm worthy of your love  
As the last person on the earth
