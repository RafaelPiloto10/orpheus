Oh, it feels like, it was yesterday  
When you came into my life  
And took my heart away  
Now I find, myself looking back  
And I'm realizing how  
You turned me inside out  
And left with no doubt  
  
Oh you're the only one  
The love I feel  
And you're the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
Now I see what it's all about  
No more chasin' my own tail  
There's nothing left to fear  
As long as you are here  
  
Oh you're the only one  
The love I feel  
And you're the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
Oh you're the only one I know  
The love I feel  
And you're the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
I can't explain the way I feel  
I've waited so long  
For someone like you
