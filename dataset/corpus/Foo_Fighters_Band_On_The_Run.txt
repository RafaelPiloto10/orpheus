Shout, shout, let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, come on  
  
Shout, shout, let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, come on  
  
In violent times  
You shouldn't have to sell your soul  
In black and white  
They really really ought to know  
Those one-track minds  
That took you for a working boy  
Kiss them goodbye  
You shouldn't have to jump for joy  
You shouldn't have to  
  
Shout (jump for) shout (joy), let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, come on  
  
They gave you life  
And in return you gave them hell  
As cold as ice  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
I hope we live to  
  
Shout (tell the) shout (tale), let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, come on  
  
Shout, shout, let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, come on  
  
Shout, shout, let it all out (let it all out...)  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, so come on  
  
And when you've taken down your guard  
If I could change your mind  
I'd really love to break your heart  
I'd really love to break  
  
Shout (break your), shout (heart), let it all out  
These are the things I can do without (I'd really love to break your heart)  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, come on  
  
Shout, shout, let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
I'm talking to you, so come on
