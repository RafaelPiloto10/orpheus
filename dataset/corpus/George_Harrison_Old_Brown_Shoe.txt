I want a love that's right  
Right is only half of what's wrong  
I want a short-haired girl  
Who sometimes wears it twice as long  
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe  
Oh, baby I'm in love with you  
So glad you came here  
It won't be the same now I'm telling you  
You know you picked me up  
From where some try to drag me down  
And when I see your smile  
Replacing every thoughtless frown  
Got me escaping from the zoo  
Oh, baby I'm in love with you  
So glad you came here  
It won't be the same now I'm telling you  
If I'll grow up I'll be a singer  
Wear rings on every finger  
Not worrying what they or you say  
Live and love and maybe someday  
Who knows baby you may comfort me, yeah  
I may appear to be imperfect  
But my love is something you can't reject  
Changing faster than the weather  
You and me should get together  
Who knows baby you may comfort me  
I want the love of yours  
To miss that love is something I'd hate  
I'll make an early start  
I'm making sure that I'm not late  
For your sweet tough lip I'm in the queue  
Oh, baby I'm in love with you  
So glad you came here  
It won't be the same now I'm telling you  
So glad you came here  
It won't be the same now I'm telling you  
So glad you came here  
It won't be the same now when I'm with you, oh yeah, yeah  
do-dai, do do-dai  
Do-dai, do do-dai  
Do-dai, do do-dai  
Do-dai, do do-dai
