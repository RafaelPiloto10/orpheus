I'm on a sentimental journey  
Into sight and sound  
Of no return and no looking back or down  
A conscientious objector to the  
War that's in my mind  
Leaving in the lurch and I'm  
Taking back what's mine  
  
I'm on a mission  
Into destination unknown  
An expedition  
Onto desolation road  
(where I'm a...)  
  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Lost and found, trouble bound,  
Castaway  
  
I'm riding on the night train and  
Driving stolen cars  
Testing my nerves out on the blvd.  
Spontaneous combustion in the  
Corners of my mind  
Leaving in the lurch  
And I'm taking back what's mine  
  
I'm on a mission  
Into destination unknown  
An expedition  
Onto desolation road  
(where I'm a...)  
  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Lost and found, trouble bound,  
Castaway
