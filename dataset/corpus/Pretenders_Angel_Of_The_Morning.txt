There'll be no strings to bind your hands  
Not if my love can bind your heart  
And there's no need to take a stand  
For it was I who chose to start  
I see no reason to take me home  
I'm old enough to face the dawn  
  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, oh baby  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Then slowly turn away from me  
  
Maybe the sun's light will be dim  
So it won't matter anyhow  
If morning's echo says we've sinned  
Well, it was what I wanted now  
And if we're the victims of the night  
I won't be blinded by the light  
  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, oh baby  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Then slowly turn away  
I won't beg you to stay with me  
Through the tears of the day  
Of the years, oh baby baby, baby baby  
  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby  
Just call me angel of the morning, angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me  
Oh baby, baby, oh baby
