I got a picture of a photograph  
Of a wedding and a shell  
It's just burning itching memory  
I never kiss and tell  
  
So turn it up and burn it  
There's a hole in your head  
There's a hole in your head  
Where the birds can't sing along  
Does anybody know how the story really goes  
How the story really goes  
Or do we all just hum along  
  
Sell your soul and sign an autograph  
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash  
I wanna cry but I gotta laugh  
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh  
  
Spin me up, spin me, spin me out  
Station to station send me up and out  
Is this what life and love is all about  
I think I think so  
  
We used to see in color  
Now it's only black and white  
Yeah it's only black and white  
'Cause the world is color blind  
Does anybody know how the story really goes  
How the story really goes  
Or do we all just hum along  
  
Sell your soul and sign an autograph  
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash  
I wanna cry but I gotta laugh  
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh  
  
Nothing's for free  
Nothing's for free  
Take it away boys
