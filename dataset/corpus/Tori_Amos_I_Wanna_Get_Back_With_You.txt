I was a fool to say the things I said  
I just lost my head  
Made you cry, made you go  
I didn't mean to be so cold  
I had no right mistreating you that way  
And oh, how could I know the price I'd pay  
Sorry I ever caused you pain  
Sorry I, sorry I said those hurtful things  
But baby, all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just give me one more try)  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just stop this hurt inside)  
I gotta get back with you  
I been walking down these cold and lonely streets  
I been losing sleep  
Had to prove I was strong  
But every night, every night just proved me wrong  
Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand  
And oh, just let it slip away like sand  
Oh, gimme one chance to make it right  
One more chance, one more chance back in your light  
'Cause baby, all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you  
(Hold me just like before)  
I wanna get back with you  
(Taking me somewhere warm)  
I gotta get back with you  
Baby, I'd give my soul  
Just to hold one more time  
Just to look in your eyes  
'Cause right now I'm half alive  
No matter what I do  
There's no living without you  
Can't you see, baby  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just give me one more try)  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just stop this hurt inside)  
I gotta get back with you  
(Hold me just like before)  
(Taking me somewhere warm)  
I wanna get back with you, babe  
I wanna get back with you, baby  
I wanna get back!  
I gotta get back with you!  
Oh, take me back!
