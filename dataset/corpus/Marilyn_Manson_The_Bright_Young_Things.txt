We'll be the worms in your apple pie  
Fake abuse for our bios  
Blacken our own eyes  
The grass isn't greener on the other side  
We set it on fire  
And we have no reason why.  
Set fashion, not follow  
Spit vitriol, not swallow  
We set fashion, not follow  
Spit vitriol, not swallow  
  
We're  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
We're the bright young things  
I've got my villain necktie  
And a mouth of hi-fi  
So sharp, I'm bleeding  
from my Judas Hole  
I'm the Arch Dandy  
No-goodnik and I'm headed  
For Crashville.  
  
I'm most monster with my groan box  
In the "Meat Show."  
We set fashion, not follow  
Spit vitriol, not swallow  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
We're the bright young things  
Crashing the ether  
We've got the loudest stereotype  
Even neophytes deep 6 your pro-life.  
  
We Don't need to move a single prayer bone  
We're so beautiful and damned  
Simply as a "still life."  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
Perpetual rebellion with absolutely no cause  
  
Stop the song and remember what you used to be  
Somebody that fucking impressed me  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
We're the bright young things  
We know who we are and what we want to say  
And we don't care who's listening  
We don't rebel to sell  
It just suits us well  
  
We're the bright young things  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad  
Good for nothing but being  
Everything that's bad
