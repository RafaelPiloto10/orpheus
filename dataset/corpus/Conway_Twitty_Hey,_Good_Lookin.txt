Hey, good lookin', what you got cookin'?  
Hows about cookin' something up with me  
(Conway)  
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe  
You could find us a brand new recipe?  
  
I got a hotrod Ford and a two dollar bill  
I know a spot right over the hill  
Have sugar pop and the dance is free  
So if you wanna have fun come along with me.  
  
Say hey, good lookin' what you got cookin'  
Hows about cookin' something up with me?  
  
I'm free and I'm ready, so we can go steady  
Hows about sharing all of your company  
No more lookin', I know I said lookin'  
Hows about keepin' steady company.  
  
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence  
And buy me one for five or ten cents  
Keep it 'til it's covered with age  
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page.  
  
Say, hey, good lookin' what you got cookin'  
Hows about cookin' something up with me?  
  
Say, hey, good lookin' what you got cookin'  
Hows about cookin' something up with me?  
Hows about cookin' something up with me?...
