Dear Hyde  
No more can I  
Explain, I've tried  
With words in vain  
They pass you by  
Like falling rain  
From perfect skies  
Still falls the rain  
Inside  
  
Hey brother don't be square  
Here it is not over there  
I'm your man, I've got it made  
You need my fire you need my shade  
You're here Hyde  
  
Once more inspire  
This strangely tied  
Uncertain frame  
So torn inside  
Still falls the rain  
Two minds, one vein  
Still falls the rain  
Inside  
  
Hey doctor don't be scared  
It's you and me so where's my share?  
I'm the man just move aside  
Call me mister call me Hyde  
Hey lover don't be shy  
I'm a single minded guy  
  
Better watch me, boy I'm rough  
Half a man ain't strong enough  
Hey brother don't be square  
Here it is not over there  
I'm your man, I've got it made  
You feed my fire you need my shade
