Enchantress came to me  
And said, meet me at the lake tonight  
  
I hunt this song to the white  
Through the shroud of snow I saw paradise  
Peace, no more lies  
  
Crestfallen soul  
Rest for this night  
Love is here  
Right here under my wings  
  
I dream of wolves  
With them I run  
For me she lengthened the night  
I am home  
I am in peace  
  
Crestfallen soul  
Rest for this night  
Love is here  
Right here under my wings
