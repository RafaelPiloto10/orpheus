[Lauryn Hill Talking]  
  
...I've written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation...  
  
...It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I  
put the record out, people would Misunderstand what I meant by "Rebel" and  
they just take it to the streets...  
  
[One and only verse]  
  
Ok, yeah, alright...  
I find it hard to say, that everything is alright  
Don't look at me that way, like everything is alright  
Cuz my own eyes can see, through all your false pretenses  
But what you fail to see, is all the consequences  
You think our lives are cheap, and easy to be wasted  
As history repeats, so foul you can taste it  
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it  
His life so incomplete, and nothing can replace it  
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it  
Your lives so incomplete, and nothing can replace it  
Fret not thyself I say, against these laws of man  
Cuz like the Bible says, His blood is on their hands  
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say, is rebel  
While today is still today, choose well  
And what I gotta say, is rebel, it can't go down this way  
Choose well, choose well, choose well...  
...choose well, choose well, choose well  
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it  
Your lives are so incomplete, and nothing, and no one, can replace it  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say  
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say  
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say  
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say  
Is rebel... rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel  
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel  
Repent, the day is far too spent, rebel... rebel!  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up...  
Wake up and rebel  
We must destroy in order to rebuild  
Wake up, you might as well  
Oh are you... oh are you satisfied  
Oh are you satisfied  
Rebel... ohhh rebel  
Why don't you rebel, why don't you rebel?  
Why don't you rebel?  
I'm fading myself down now...
