Verse 1  
There's a whole in my heart  
Lying here in the dark  
Wishing we could be starting again  
Oh but everything changed  
When I threw it away  
Maybe we could try to pretend yeah  
That I never let you down  
No I never run around  
And no your not gonna be leavin' leavin' leavin'  
  
Bridge  
No need for you to go yanno  
Why I'm sinking like a song  
C'mon won't you let me down easy easy easy  
  
Chorus  
Cos you know that I'm still in love  
And I guess it's just not enough  
But at least we had our moment in the the sun  
Yeah I can apologize  
But I see it in your eyes  
That I could never make it right before I let you go  
Just you and I girl just for tonight girl  
And let me hold you one last time  
It's you and I girl just for tonight girl  
  
Verse 2  
Leave your bags by the door  
And my heart on the floor  
There's no single word I can say  
When I see you with him  
And it's only as friends  
Will I only be in your way  
  
Bridge  
No need for you to go yanno  
Why I'm sinking like a stone  
C'mon won't you let me down easy easy easy  
  
Chorus  
Cos you know that I'm still in love  
And I guess it's just not enough  
But at least we had our moment in the the sun  
Yeah I can apologize  
But I see it in your eyes  
That I could never make it right before I let you go  
Just you and I girl just for tonight girl  
And let me hold you one last time  
It's you and I girl just for tonight girl  
  
No don't you leave this way  
I'm begging you to stay now baby  
Just give me one more day  
And maybe maybe  
  
Chorus  
Cos you know that I'm still in love  
And I guess it's just not enough  
But at least we had our moment in the the sun  
Yeah I can apologize  
But I see it in your eyes  
That I could never make it right before I let you go(I let you go)
