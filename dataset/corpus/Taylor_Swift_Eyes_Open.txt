Everybody's waiting,  
Everybody's watching,  
Even when you're sleeping,  
Keep your ah-eyes open.  
  
The tricky thing,  
Is yesterday we were just children,  
Playing soldiers just pretending,  
Dreaming dreams with happy endings,  
In backyards,  
Winning battles with the  
Wooden swords,  
But now we've stepped into a  
Cruel world,  
Where everybody stands and  
Keeps score,  
Keep your eyes open.  
  
Everybody's waiting, to see the breakdown, everybody's watching, to see the
fallout,  
Even when your sleeping, sleeping, keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes open.  
  
So here you are,  
Two steps ahead and stating  
On guard,  
Every lesson forms a new scar,  
They never thought you'd make it this far,  
But turn around,  
Now they've surrounded you,  
It's a showdown,  
Nobody comes to save you now,  
But you've got something they don't, yeah you've got something they don't, you
just gotta  
Keep your eyes open.  
  
Everybody's waiting, to see the breakdown, everybody's watching, to see the
fallout, even when your sleeping, sleeping, keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes - keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady,  
Keep your eyes open.  
  
Keep your aim locked,  
The night grows dark,  
Keep your eyes open.

(Keep your ah-eyes open,  
Keep your ah-eyes open,  
Keep your eyes open.)  
  
Everybody's waiting, to see the breakdown, everybody's watching, to see the
fallout, even when your sleeping, sleeping, keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes open.
