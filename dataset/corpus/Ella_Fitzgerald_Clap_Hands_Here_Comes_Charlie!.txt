Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, good time Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
This way, join the party  
I say, meet McCarty  
Hey, hey, Charlie, take a bow  
  
Ginger ale and white rock for his table  
Grab a chair, move over there  
And let him sit right next to Mabel  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, good time Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, good time Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
This way, meet The Dollies  
I say, Zeigfield Follies  
Hey, Charlie, take a bow  
  
See the smile on all those hungry faces  
They can tell that he's a buyer  
From those wide and open spaces  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, good time Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
See the smile on all those hungry faces  
They can tell that he's a buyer  
From those wide and open spaces  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie, oh boy, yeah  
  
Ginger ale and white rock for his table  
Grab a chair, move over there  
And let him wait  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, good time Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
This way, join the party  
I say, meet McCarty  
Hey, hey, Charlie, take a bow  
  
See the smile on all those hungry faces  
They can tell that he's a buyer  
From those wide and open spaces  
  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie  
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now  
  
He's a big man with the ladies  
And sail her with his doubt  
When he starts to wail and holler, "Go man go"  
  
Oh boy, there was Charlie  
What joy, swingin' Charlie  
Clap hands, there goes Charlie now
