I walk into this room  
All eyes on me now  
But I do not know the people inside  
Look straight through me these eyes  
Seeking more wisdom  
Than I have to give away  
Realize realize  
What you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
What you've become  
Just as I have  
Are you and I so unalike  
Huddled here  
You just as I am  
Afraid if we dance  
We will die  
Mock the world  
Live safe say why  
Don't you know  
When you give life  
Then you become  
What you are  
  
The sea is unsparing  
We're all drifting away  
Away from you  
But I pray for you now  
Hoping to god on high  
Is like clinging to straws  
While drowning oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you are  
Is a best in a lover's arms  
What you are  
Is the devil in a sweet sweet kiss  
What you are  
Is a puzzle to me  
  
[Chorus]
