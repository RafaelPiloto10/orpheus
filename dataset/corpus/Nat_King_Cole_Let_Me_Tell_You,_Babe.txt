Let me tell you, babe  
You got me crazy  
You got your head in  
Those big white clouds  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You got me crazy  
You don't know, girl  
What life's all about  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You must be dreaming  
The world ain't spinning  
Just for you alone  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You must be dreaming  
'Cause it's rough, girl  
Out there on your own  
  
And love that's worth your salt  
Don't grow on trees  
It won't show upon  
Every breeze that blows  
  
It beats me, honey  
How your eyes don't see  
They just don't see what's  
Right in front of your nose  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You just ain't thinking  
The grass ain't greener  
On that side of town  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You know I need you  
If you stay, girl  
I won't let you down  
  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
If you stay, girl  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
I won't let you down  
  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
If you stay, girl  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
I won't let you down
