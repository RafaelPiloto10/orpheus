Alright  
  
Well, the night keeps gettin' shorter  
And the day keeps getting near  
And your daddy wants to give up his daughter  
But you think, you think you don't want him  
  
You got me standing underneath your window  
While you're deliberating on your fate  
And you would really like to let me in though  
But your fiance doesn't know your date  
  
Well, if you thinkin' life could be much sweeter  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
  
Well, we could leave tonight for Puerto Rico  
Or we could catch a train to F-L-A  
'Cause with your wedding day around the corner  
I get to thinking that you shouldn't wait  
  
You know that once the ring is on your finger  
It's so much harder for a girl today  
She won't be cozy with a rock 'n' roll singer  
And throw her family and her husband away  
  
Well, if you thinkin' life could be much sweeter  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
  
I just can't wait  
  
Well, if you thinkin' life could be much sweeter  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate  
Baby, doncha, doncha, doncha hesitate
