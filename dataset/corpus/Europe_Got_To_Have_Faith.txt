The race is on  
I found my way  
Something has changed since I've been away  
The fear is gone  
And I can't wait  
I feel the rut, still got dues to pay  
  
Well I had enough  
Gonna stand up straight  
Rebuild my life  
Well you gotta have faith  
And it will be tough  
Gonna fight each day  
'Til I'm back on top  
Well you gotta have faith  
  
Full speed ahead  
I waste no time  
Now I know how to live my life  
I've been knocked down - come back around  
It put some soul in this heart of mine  
  
Well I had enough  
Gonna stand up straight  
Rebuild my life  
Well you gotta have faith  
And it will be tough  
Gonna fight each day  
'Til I'm back on top  
Well you gotta have faith  
  
I get the feelin'  
I can go that extra mile  
I get the feelin'  
I can reach that open sky  
I get the feelin'  
Things will never be the same  
I get the feelin'  
That I can win again!  
  
Well I had enough  
Gonna stand up straight  
Rebuild my life  
Well you gotta have faith  
And it will be tough  
Gonna fight each day  
'Til I'm back on top  
Well you gotta have faith  
Well you gotta have faith  
Well you gotta have faith
