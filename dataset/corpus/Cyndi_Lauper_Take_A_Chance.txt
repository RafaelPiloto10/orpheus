I wanna run my fingers through your hair  
Squeeze your hand and tell you that I care  
Park in the dark and kiss goodnight  
Thrill me h-h-hold me tight  
C'mon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me  
I'll fall still when you walk in the room  
I'll look up and you'll be lookin' c-c-cool  
Curled up smile upon your lips  
One button low my heart just flips  
C'mon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me  
The stars complete the melody  
Could you say you belong to me  
And as they ride the milkyway  
Baby, baby can I have this dance  
Baby, baby can you take a chance someday-  
Did I tell you now  
I wanna...
