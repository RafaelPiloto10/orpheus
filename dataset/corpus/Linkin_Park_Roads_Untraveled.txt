Weep not for roads untraveled  
Weep not for paths left lone  
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end  
It's the worst kind of pain I've known  
  
Give up your heart left broken  
And let that mistake pass on  
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost  
And in time you'll be glad it's gone  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  
whoa, whoa  
  
Weep not for roads untraveled  
Weep not for sights unseen  
May your love never end and if you need a friend,  
There's a seat here alongside me  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Whoa, whoa
