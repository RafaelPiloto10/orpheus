Finn:  
There is freedom within, there is freedom without  
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup  
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost  
But you'll never see the end of the road  
While you're traveling with me  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Finn with Tina:  
Don't dream it's over  
  
Finn:  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Finn with Tina:  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they won't win  
  
Tina and Blaine:  
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof  
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof  
  
Sam and Brittany:  
In the paper today tales of war and of waste  
But you turn right over to the T.V. page  
  
Blaine with Tina and New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over  
Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they won't win  
  
New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah  
  
Tina:  
Ooo, yeah! (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Finn:  
Hey now, hey now (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
Don't dream it's over  
  
Tina:  
Don't dream 'til it's over (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Finn:  
Yeah! (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Tina:  
Oh oh whoa! (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Finn:  
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum  
  
Finn and Tina:  
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart  
  
Tina and Blaine:  
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof  
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release  
(New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh! )  
  
Marley:  
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah!  
  
Finn with New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over  
Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah! )  
  
Finn:  
We know they won't win  
No they won't win!  
  
Sam with Tina and New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over (Marley: Don't let them win)  
Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in (Marley: When the world comes in)  
They come, they come  
  
Sam with Blaine:  
To build a wall between us (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Tina:  
Hey now, hey now, ooo ooo  
  
Blaine:  
Don't let them win!  
  
New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now (Tina: Oh yeah! )  
Don't dream it's over (Blaine: Don't let them win)  
Hey now, hey now (Tina: Ooo ooo ooo ooo oh oh oh oh)  
Don't dream it's over  
  
Finn, Tina, and Blaine with New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over
