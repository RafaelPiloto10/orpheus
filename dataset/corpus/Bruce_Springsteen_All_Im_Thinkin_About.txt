Blind man wavin' by the side of the road  
I'm in a flat bed Ford carrying a heavy load  
With a sweet thing sippin' on a blueberry wine  
On a flat black highway down in Carolina  
Black bird slippin' in a sky of blue  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, honey  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Little boy carryin' a fishin' pole  
Little girl pickin' berries straight off of the vine  
Brown bag filled with a little green toad  
We hook 'em through the lip and throw 'em off of the line  
Your sweet brown legs got me feeling so blue  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Black car shinin' on a Sunday morn  
Mama go to church now, Mama go to church now  
Friday night daddy's shirt is torn  
Daddy's goin' downtown, daddy's goin' downtown  
Ain't no one understand this sweet thing we do  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
  
Field turned up, the seed is sowed  
Rain comin' in from over 'cross the road  
Big black curtain coming 'cross the field  
Blind 'll see, the lame will be healed  
Brown eyed girl, I turned my back on you, now it's lonely  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you,  
Ain't nothin' in this world take away these blues  
  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
All I'm thinkin' about is you  
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it  
All I'm thinkin' about is you
