Back through the years  
I go wandering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall the box of rags  
Someone gave us  
And how my mama put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was away down in the fall  
Mama sewed the rags together  
So in every piece with luck  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the Bible she had read  
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore  
And then she said,  
Perhaps this coat  
Will bring you good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And my mama blessed it with a kiss  
My coat of many colors  
That my mama made for me  
Made only from rags  
That I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
Well, I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
And no, I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them all the story  
Mama told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
"But one is only poor  
Only if he chooses to be."  
Now I know we had no money  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
Made just for me
