I want a dog,  
A Chihuahua  
When I get back to my small flat  
I want to hear somebody bark  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
  
Don't want a cat,  
Scratching its claws all over my  
Habitat  
Giving no love and getting fat  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
And a cat's no help with that  
  
I want a dog,  
To walk in the park  
When it gets dark, my dog will bark  
At any passers-by  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
I want a dog  
  
I want a dog,  
A Chihuahua  
When I get back to my small flat  
I want to hear somebody bark  
Oh, (oh oh) you can get lonely  
I want a dog
