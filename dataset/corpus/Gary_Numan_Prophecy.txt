We are deceived  
Valhalla is falling  
We are betrayed  
We are lost and forsaken.  
He's sold the world  
Sold us all to the hunger  
The body of Christ  
Is as black as his soul.  
  
The word of the Lord  
Is the lie of your father  
This mortal sin  
Is a voice of shame.  
Look at the storm  
Like a dying apostle  
Cruel and divine  
Like the ghost of man.  
  
And now you realise  
I am the truth.  
  
Worship the dead  
The damned and misled  
Tortured and bled  
Like the voices of reason.  
Sacred and pure  
Sanctified obsession  
Holy and cured  
Like a doorway to heaven.  
  
Sisterhood cried  
Innocence lied  
Purity died  
With the angels of passion.  
Blessed are they  
Who pay homage to rumour  
I've seen the light  
Shine on the grave of Man.  
  
And now you realise  
I am the truth.  
  
And I believed.  
Amen.
