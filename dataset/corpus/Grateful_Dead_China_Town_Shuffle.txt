Take it, you can have it  
What I got, baby, I can't hold  
If you find the secret  
Tell me how to build the mold  
And I can't handle your problems  
Don't try to handle mine  
Get yourself a shotgun, a pocketful of shells  
While away the time  
Get it right, do it nice  
If you make a mistake, pay for it twice  
But if you need it, got to have it  
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home  
Look up the wall, you know you gotta call  
Before you start calling, be ready to fall  
And if you fall in my direction  
Don't expect no help at all  
Get it right, do it nice  
If you make a mistake, pay for it twice  
And if you need it, got to have it  
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home  
Look up the wall, you know you gotta call  
Before you start calling, be ready to fall  
And if you fall in my direction  
Don't expect no help at all  
Don't expect no help at all  
Don't expect no help at all  
And if you fall in my direction  
Don't expect no help at all
