If you don't listen what the people say  
The people gonna have to take their own way  
You got to give the people what they need  
And only then will they begin to see  
  
There's a world that we don't know  
There's a world we never see  
Espresso  
  
I don't need this trouble, I don't need the grief  
I don't need to feel this pressure down on me  
Every day there's something we don't really need  
Stop, think, walk away and let it be  
Stop, think, walk away and let it be  
Espresso  
  
There's a world that we don't know  
There's a world we never see  
Espresso
