You've got a problem  
With the reason why  
An asymmetric haircut  
And a painted eye  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)  
  
Is it a cry for help  
Or call to arms?  
Frustration  
False alarms  
It's psychological  
(All in the mind)  
  
There's something in the attic  
And it smells so bad  
An undertaker  
In a bowler hat  
(Psychological)  
What's that spilt  
On the kitchen floor?  
Who's that knocking  
On the cellar door?  
It's psychological  
Or is it only your imagination?  
Driving me crazy, crazy  
Baby, baby, please  
  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)  
  
I thought I heard a baby cry  
I thought I heard a train  
Down in the cemetery  
Cellophane  
  
It's second nature to you  
All in the mind  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)  
It's psychological  
(Psychological)
