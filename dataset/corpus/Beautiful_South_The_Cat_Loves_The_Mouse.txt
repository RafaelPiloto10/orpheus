We've come a long way from the cave  
What, you started to shave?  
Now we know just how to behave  
Since chivalry decided to bathe  
  
And as the skirts we wore were increasingly high  
Till the hem was just a cloud in the sky  
And the chat up lines got increasingly fly  
As the truth bought a suit and a tie  
  
The cat loves the mouse  
The mouse loves the cheese  
The bees love the birds  
The birds love those bees  
The bee loves that honey  
So honey please  
Why are we so different to these?  
  
So when I'm old and I'm grey  
You know you already are  
When I'm overweight  
You know you already are  
If I've overstayed my welcome by a day  
Just feel free to say  
You know I already have  
  
And as the skirts we wore were increasingly high  
Till the hem was just a cloud in the sky  
And the chat up lines got increasingly fly  
As the truth bought a suit and a tie  
  
The cat chases bird  
To the top of the tree  
The dog chases postman  
To the end of the street  
The postman he chases  
Every girl that he meets  
So why are we so different to these?  
  
I've been your bird, I've been your bitch  
I've been whatever B you ever wished  
I've been your cat, I've been your chick  
I've been which ever C you thought to pick  
I've been your bat, I've been your cow  
I've been whichever B and C that you'd allow  
I've been your dog, your dragon and your duck  
I've been whatever D you thought was cool to fuck
