Did the best I could to make you mine  
If you ever felt anything for me  
Well, you never gave a sign  
Thought time would make you change  
Make you want me but baby I never had a chance  
Now, I know that there's just some things  
Just not meant to be  
No use makin' you care about me  
No way that I'm gonna win  
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind  
Oh, I'm just chasin' the wind  
Open up my heart, let you inside  
If love was what you we're lookin' for  
Well, I guess it wasn't mine  
So I guess I better go, it's over and done  
But you know I'm not really sad at all  
'Cause you can't really say it's over  
When it never had begun  
No use makin' you care about me  
No way that I'm gonna win  
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind  
Oh, I'm just chasin' the wind  
Can't reach the sea if you can't get past the sand  
Can't touch the sky if you can't reach up your hand  
Can't give if you give nothin' back  
No use makin' you care about me  
No way that I'm gonna win  
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind  
(No use makin' you care about me)  
Makin' you care about me  
No way that I'm gonna win  
Oh darlin', I might as well be chasin' the wind  
Oh, I'm just chasin' the wind  
Oh, I'm just chasin' the wind
