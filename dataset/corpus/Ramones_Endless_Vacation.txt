I kill myself kill the pain  
A suicide death a suicide game  
My skull he's bleaching in the dust  
My rage turns to insane lust  
  
All depressed all alone  
I drift into the danger zone  
Deadly spittin cobra life of crime  
I want revenge I want what's mine  
  
Like takin' Carrie to the high school prom  
Something's always goin' wrong  
Hair trigger temper tormented mind  
Deadly spittin cobra I am losin' kind  
  
The heart is the place devils congregate  
When you're raised on a diet of bickering at hate  
Hair trigger temper tormented mind  
Deadly spittin cobra I am losin' kind  
  
Endless vacation  
Endless vacation  
Endless vacation
