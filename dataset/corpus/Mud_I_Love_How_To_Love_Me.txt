Ooh, wahh  
Ooh, wahh  
  
I love how your eyes close  
Whenever you kiss me  
Or when I'm away form you I love how you miss me  
I love the way you always treat me tenderly  
But darling most of all I love how you love me.  
  
I love how your heart beats  
Whenever I hold you  
I love how you think of me w  
Without being told to  
I love the way your touch is always heavenly  
But daring most of all I love how you love  
  
I love how your eyes close  
Whenever you kiss me  
Or when I'm away form you I love how you miss me  
I love the way you always treat me tenderly  
But darling most of all I love how you love me.  
  
I love how you love me  
I love how you squeeze me, tease me, please me,  
Love how you love me  
I love how you love me  
I love how you want me  
Ooh never stop loving me
