"Hm, just like science fiction, no one knows what the fuck they're talking  
About, heh, there's always one in every crowd"  
  
There is always one in every crowd  
You can hear the voices when you're alone  
They sound like metal on metal  
Obnoxious and loud  
  
Don't let go  
Don't listen to the sound  
Of those people you know  
Slowly falling apart  
And falling down now  
Everything is falling down now  
(Now now now)  
  
When I think I'm alone  
I watch the news  
On my girlfriends TV  
It's like a bad B-movie  
Aw sometimes I can't comprehend  
All the stupid things that I see  
  
So don't let go  
You can't believe your eyes  
Yeah, when everything they show you  
Just makes you want to cry  
And you don't want to know  
That you need to remember  
Life is always getting better  
(Better better)  
So don't let go  
(Go go go)  
  
There is always one in every crowd  
Yeah, you see them when you think you're alone  
It all just seems like science fiction  
No one knows what they are talking about  
  
So don't let go  
Don't listen to the sound  
Of those people you know  
Slowly falling apart  
And falling down now  
  
You need to remember  
Life is always getting better  
Life is always getting better  
Life is always getting better  
For a while
