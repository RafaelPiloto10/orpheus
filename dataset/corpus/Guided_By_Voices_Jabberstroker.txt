Cling to the sides, brain-boy  
we lost our numb-er selves in jail  
leaving a groovy wit matter on a sailing sky,  
alive and jabberstroking,  
sinking around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
sinking around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
  
Wings are wise, lame-boy  
louder people build a fighting bore  
dig the fast track, fucker,  
ancenstral public dig the fast track!  
  
He's the one with the talkin' rock-bull,  
clings to edge of the pool,  
Greg Case  
Examine number one  
at cause and at manners  
bounded to protect, a fighting bully  
go around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
sinking full, around you now  
around you now  
around you now  
  
On a silent sky  
dig the fast track  
alive and jabberstrokin'  
dig the fast track fucker  
think of a wide lane, boy  
dig the fast track  
promise you will go and fight  
dig the fast track, fucker  
access to the priveleges  
dig the fast track, fucker  
dig the fast track, fucker  
dig the fast track for her  
dig the fast trip  
dig the fast track
