There's a picture in the hall, I know  
And it's from a time when feelings showed  
Though I hold it close before my eyes  
My heart refuses to see  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
Through the times when two were one completely  
There was another in this well laid plan  
  
This corridor seems to stretch for years ahead  
But patient hearts cannot match times steady tread  
Is this the threshold of a fantasy?  
Is there still life at all?  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
Through the times when two were one completely  
There was another in this well laid plan  
Best laid plan of ours  
  
Watering the garden, some comfort for the twilight years  
Still, life never lingers, it marches past our veil of tears  
A moment's all we've got, to have and to hold  
Don't slip, don't blink, don't turn your head  
  
With a photographic memory  
I could live in a time that used to be  
Is this the threshold of a fantasy?  
Is there still life at all?  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
Through the times when I was won completely  
There was another in this well laid plan  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
There was a time when I was won completely  
Our emotions they got out of hand
