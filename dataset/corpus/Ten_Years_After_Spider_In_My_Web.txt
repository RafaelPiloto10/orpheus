I'm a spider in my web, I'm just waiting to catch a fly  
Spider in my web, baby, sitting and waiting to catch a fly  
Sitting in my web, darlin', just waiting for you to pass me by  
  
Sitting here, darlin', sitting here all alone  
I'm sitting here, baby, sitting all alone  
Baby, when I catch you, I'm gonna take you to my home  
  
My web isn't very sticky  
Pretty soon, you should know  
Baby, when I catch you, I will never let you go  
  
Spider in my web , darlin', I'm waiting to catch a fly  
Sitting in my web, baby, waiting for you to pass me by  
  
I said I'm a spider in my web, I'm just waiting to catch a fly  
Spider in my web, and I'm waiting to catch a fly  
Sitting in my web, darlin', waiting for you to pass my by

Oh, baby, pretty soon, you're sure to find  
Well, I'm a spider, pretty soon, you're sure to find
