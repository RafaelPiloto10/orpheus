Oh yeah  
Oh  
Wow  
  
Baby we were so in love  
Only one that I could trust  
I would never give that up  
Cause no one like her  
Knew you were my everything  
Was so glad that you with me  
Had to tell my family  
I found that girl  
  
And out a know where you were gone without a reason why  
So I'm here in this place by myself  
All you had to do was try  
If you could see it through my eyes  
It would explain the tears I cried  
Why did you walk out of my life  
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You know the reason why I tried  
So hard to never let them die  
I wish that you could see, see it thought my eyes  
  
What I'm supposed to do  
Just go on without you  
Easier said than done  
I need some answers  
Can even lift my head  
Thinking about the things she said  
Only thing that I have left  
Is my love for her  
  
And out a now where you were gone without a reason why  
So I'm here in this place by myself  
All you had to do was try  
  
If you could see it through my eyes  
It would explain the tears I cried  
Why did you walk out of my life  
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You know the reason why I tried  
So hard to never let them die  
I wish that you could see, see it thought my eyes  
  
I'm hoping and praying (hoping and praying)  
That you will return (that you will return)  
All my love is here waiting for you  
Baby just open the door  
  
If you could see it through my eyes (oh see it in your eyes)  
It would explain the tears I cried (tears I cried)  
Why would you walk out of my life  
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me (meant for me woo who)  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You know the reason why I tried (why I tried)  
So hard to never let them die  
I wish that you could see, see it thought my eyes  
My eyes
