Yeah  
  
You get under my skin  
When I'm next to you  
You get over  
Every little thing you do, I  
  
I was thinking that you never tried to hurt me  
Never wanted something from me, tried to warn me  
But you didn't really want me but I want you  
Cause you haunt me and I felt it from the start  
  
Youre going to break my heart  
So I tried to play the part  
And I knew I had to choose  
I've got nothing left to lose  
Might as well just tell the truth  
  
Chorus:  
  
You get under my skin  
When I'm next to you  
You get over  
Every little thing you do  
I can't get with it  
Can't put the blame on you  
Cause you get under my skin  
I can't get over you  
  
I was hoping, I was dreaming that Id wake up  
Think about it and I found that I had made up  
But my heartbeat tells me its not true, I want you  
Gotta have you, tell me why can't we just start  
  
Bridge:  
  
You want to break my heart  
Now youre underneath my skin  
And I feel like its a sin  
To let love walk away so fast  
I'm not your first, wont be your last  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Intermediate:  
  
Get up, get over, get under  
Oh baby you hit me like thunder  
Get over, get under, get into  
To love you is almost a sin to  
(repeat)  
  
Start  
[Bridge:]  
[Chorus:]  
(intermediate)  
[Chorus:]  
  
Get, get over  
Get, get over  
Get over  
  
Get, get over  
Get, get over  
(repeat and fade)
