Once I awoke  
The shadow of your smile had crossed my mind  
How could I know this was your last goodbye  
That's slipping through the windmills of the night  
  
You never understand when she's talking to you,  
Little boy  
You never understand when she's talking to you  
She's too far away  
  
Is it heaven or hell  
We're drifting in the wake of our dreams  
And the world is a clown who cries  
And no one can tell is it real  
Once I cried  
  
Whenever I awoke without you  
A stranger in the thunder of the dark  
I'm praying to the sun to shine tonite  
You never understand when she's talking to you,  
  
Mon amour  
You never understand when she's talking to you  
She's too far away...
