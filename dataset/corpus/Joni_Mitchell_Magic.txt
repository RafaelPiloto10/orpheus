Do you beleive in magic? In a young girl's heart?  
How the music can free her, whenever it starts,  
And itz magic!  
If the music is groovy, and makes you feel happy like an old-time movie,  
I'll tell you 'bout the magic that can free your soul,  
But itz like tryin' to tell a stranger 'bout a'rockin' roll!  
  
Do you beleive in magic?  
Come along with me.  
We'll dancin' 'till mornin' 'till itz just you and me  
And maybe.  
If the music is right,  
I'll meet you tomarrow, sorta late at night.  
Then we'll go dancin' baby then u'll see,  
How the magicz in the music,  
And the musicz in me, yeah.  
Do you beleive in magic? Yeah.  
  
I'll tell you 'bout the magic in a young girlz soul,  
Tell you 'bout the magic of a'rockin' roll.  
  
Tell you 'bout the magic that can set you free! Ooooooh!
