I need I need a revolution  
My own revolution  
My very own revolution  
I need, I need a revolution  
My own revolution  
My personal revolution  
  
Heartbreak is so hard to take  
And I lay down in the bed that I make  
Crying, crying, tears of change  
Fighting, fighting, everyday  
There must be a better way  
  
I need, I need a revolution  
My own revolution  
My personal revolution  
Baby I need, I need  
A revolution, my own revolution  
My personal revolution  
  
Ay, I don't like the hypocrisy  
Is this democracy?  
There is no voice for me  
In your philosophy  
Tainted theology  
Oh can you save me (who can save me)  
Who can save me?  
Revolution  
  
Who gotta power, I do  
Who got the say, I do (yeah)  
Who got the play, I do  
I will find a way  
Who gotta power, I do (yeah)  
Who got the say, I do (yeah)  
Who got the play, I do  
I will find a way  
  
'Cause heartbreak is so hard to take  
And then I lay down in the bed that I make  
Crying, crying, tears of change  
I'm fighting, fighting, everyday  
I know there must be a better way  
  
So I need, I need a revolution  
My own revolution  
My personal revolution  
Babe I need, I need a revolution  
My own revolution  
My personal revolution  
  
Who gotta power, I do  
Who got the say, I do  
Who got the play, I do  
I will find a way  
Who gotta power, I do (yeah)  
Who got the say, I do (yeah)  
Who got the play, I do  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I will find a way  
  
Revolution,  
My own revolution
