Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go  
My resistance running low  
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so  
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)  
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me  
I don't have a strategy  
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
But I want to know, should I want to, I'm not sure  
  
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so  
Really let my anger show  
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite "no"  
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)  
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well  
Something like a magic spell  
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I would know how
