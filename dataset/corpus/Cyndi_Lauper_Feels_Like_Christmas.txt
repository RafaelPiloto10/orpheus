If you want to see me  
Don't break down and cry  
I can be your sweetie  
If you be a friend of mine  
And I won't be forsaken  
If you think thoughts unkind  
Just bring home the bacon  
And bring it home on time  
  
Hey Louie, can't you see  
I couldn't leave you if I tried  
Hey Louie, listen to me  
We got a thing so dignified  
It don't matter if we lived in a shack  
Or in a shiny cadillac  
It don't matter rich or poor  
When love is knocking at your door  
  
It feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas with you...  
  
Hey Louie, life is sweet  
I can't be bitter  
When you're here with me  
Hey Louie, no regrets  
Holding on to things  
That you ought to forget  
Well, it doesn't matter tit for tat  
'Cause what you give  
You get it back  
It don't matter anymore  
When love is knocking at your door  
  
It feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas with you,  
Everytime I see ya  
Everytime I hear ya  
Everytime I'm near ya,  
I'd be happy  
Because it feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas  
With you...
