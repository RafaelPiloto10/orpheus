Now when I go to work, I work all day,  
Always turns out the same.  
When I bring home my hard-earned pay  
I spend my money all on mary jane.  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord, my mary jane.  
Oh if a man should look tame now, mean and mature,  
They all turn out the same.  
'cause they can't do nothing to make a man feel good  
Like my old mary jane.  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord, my mary jane.  
Now I walk in the street now lookin' for a friend  
One that can lend me some change.  
And he never questions my reason why,  
'cause he too loves mary jane.  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord, my mary jane.  
Well, I have known women that wanted no man,  
Some that wanted to stay.  
But I never knew what happened in this world  
Till I met up with mary jane,  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord my mary jane.  
Oh, when I'm feelin' lonesome and I'm feelin' blue,  
There's only one way to change.  
Now I walk down the street now lookin' for a man,  
One that knows my mary jane,  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord my mary jane.
