Ryder:  
When your day is long  
And the night, the night is yours alone  
When you're sure you've had enough of this life  
Well, hang on  
  
Don't let yourself go  
'Cause everybody cries  
And everybody hurts, sometimes  
  
Sometimes everything is wrong  
Now it's time to sing along  
When your day is night alone, hold on  
When you feel like letting go, hold on  
If you think you've had too much of this life  
Well, hang on  
  
'Cause everybody hurts  
Take comfort in your friends  
Everybody hurts  
Don't throw your hand, oh no  
Don't throw your hand  
If you feel like you're alone  
No, no, no, you're not alone  
  
If you're on your own in this life  
The days and nights are long  
When you think you've had too much of this life  
To hang on  
  
Well, everybody hurts  
Sometimes, everybody cries  
Everybody hurts, sometimes  
And everybody hurts, sometimes  
So hold on
