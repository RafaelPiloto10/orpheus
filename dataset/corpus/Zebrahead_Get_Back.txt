Here comes the boom  
  
I got game like Kobe, act like you know me,  
If you rhyme better well then kid you best show me  
Fly by wrecking, never come in second, fists in my pocket  
And use my words as my weapon  
Ghetto blaster thumping, girlies are bumping,  
Got to get the dough like my man Donald Trump and  
Set this in motion, jaws in the ocean,  
If you need a rhyme well, then kid I got the potion  
  
Damn  
Building this up like a high rise,  
Better yet phatter than Nell Carter's right thigh  
Coming in slanging, never leave you hanging,  
If you talk then on your door I'm banging  
Twisting up hip hop, running with my flip flops,  
Past all the cops just chilling in the donut shops  
For no other reason, no it ain't treason,  
Just coming up cause this is the zebrahead season  
  
Get it back  
I didn't want it  
Didn't need it  
My time is the only thing that you have taken  
So above the world, don't be mistaken  
Get it back  
I didn't want it  
Didn't need it  
You've lost the only thing that you were given  
Afraid to stand alone, so now you're tripping  
  
Living life disco, here to San Francisco,  
Do my own stunts cause I like to take the risk, yo  
Punk rock rhyming, rap is always climbing,  
Like your first time cause I'll pop out your hymen  
With the bass drum booming, jump up in the room and,  
Watch the walls sway cause the groove is grooving  
Got your hands shaking, suckers that I'm baking,  
Made you look dumb cause it's your girl that I'm  
Taking  
What?  
  
Let me set this off like a bomb,  
Have your ass stepping like Jerry had Tom and I'm gone  
With the free style form that I'm kicking,  
Have your ass tripping, with the rhymes that I'm flipping  
And this ain't no west coast thing,  
It's a world wide ring with the style we bring, right?  
So watch the dime drop as I harvest my crop cause  
I'm going to ride this to the top
