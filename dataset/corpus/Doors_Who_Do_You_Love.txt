I walked 47 miles on barb wire  
Cobra snake for a necktie  
Built a house by the roadside  
Made of rattlesnake hide  
Brand new chimney up on top  
Made out of human skulls  
  
Come on baby take a walk with me  
Tell me who do you love  
Who do you love, now  
Who do you love, now  
Who do you love, babe  
I say who now, who do you love  
  
Tombstone head and a graveyard mind  
Just 22 and I don't mind dying  
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip  
Come on baby don't give me no lip  
  
Who do you love, now  
Who do you love  
Who do you love, child  
  
Night is dark, the sky was blue  
Down the alley the ice wagon flew  
Hit a bump, somebody screamed  
Should of heard just what I seen  
Do you love me, babe  
Do you love her, yeah  
Do you love me, babe  
Do you love it, yeah  
  
Well, who, baby, who do you love  
What do you love, now  
Love, love, love me babe  
Love, love, love me darling  
We're gonna have some fun tonight, right  
All right, all right
