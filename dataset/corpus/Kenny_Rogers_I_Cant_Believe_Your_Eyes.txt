Would you like to dance?  
Not very good, I'll admit it  
I just need a minute or two  
Close your eyes, cos  
  
I can't believe your eyes  
Wild and blue, warm and willing  
I can't believe your eyes  
Is it true what they're saying?  
  
Women come and go  
So many occasions I have to look twice  
To catch your second show  
One look at you, that's all I needed tonight, 'cos  
  
I can't believe your '  
  
Don't stop, the music playing  
Don't wanna lose it tonight  
Now that we got that feeling  
So good, so right  
  
I can't believe your '
