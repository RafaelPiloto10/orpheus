Let's throw a twilight cookout  
We two, you two, no more  
Way out somewhere in the country  
Where we've never been before  
  
Let's throw it on a weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And lounge away a holiday  
Like we've never done before  
  
We'll bring the rounds and some jazzy sound  
To play by a cozy fire  
You two roast wieners and we'll toast the buns  
And we'll chow till the night grows nighter  
  
We'll call for you on the weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And ride out somewhere in the country air  
Just a cozy clan of four
