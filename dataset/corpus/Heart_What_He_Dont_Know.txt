He don't know that you been coming around  
He don't know that we been out of bounds  
Things we do are better left unsaid  
You and me can never keep our heads  
What he don't know  
Will never hurt him  
What he don't know  
Is I have changed  
It's just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
  
Baby, I'm open to your every suggestion  
Nothing you ask is out of the question  
Things I wouldn't do ya got me doin'  
And oh, what I wouldn't do for you  
  
What he don't know  
Will never hurt him  
What he don't know  
Is I have changed  
It's just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
What he don't know
