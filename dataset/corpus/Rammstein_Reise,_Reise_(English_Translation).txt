Even on the waves there is fighting  
Where fish and flesh are woven into sea  
One stabs the lance into an army  
Another throws it into the ocean  
  
Ahoy  
  
Arise, arise seaman arise  
Each does it in his own way  
One thrusts the spear into a man  
Another then into the fish  
  
Arise, arise seaman arise  
And the waves cry softly  
In their blood a spear is lodged  
They bleed softly into the ocean  
  
The lance must be drowned in flesh  
Fish and man sink to the depths  
Where the black soul dwells  
There is no light on the horizon  
  
Ahoy  
  
Arise, arise seaman arise  
Each does it in his own way  
One thrusts the spear into a man  
Another then into the fish  
  
Arise, arise seaman arise  
And the waves cry softly  
In their blood a spear is lodged  
They bleed softly into the ocean  
  
Arise, arise seaman arise  
And the waves cry softly  
In their heart a spear is lodged  
They bleed themselves dry on the shore
