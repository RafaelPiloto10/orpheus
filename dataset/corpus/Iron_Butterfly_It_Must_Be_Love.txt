Ah, nothing on earth could be so fine  
I think I might have found something  
And I think it might be my love  
  
Yes, I think I came across something  
And I think she might be my love  
  
Oh---oh---oh---  
Yes, it must be love  
I've found out its worth, it must be love  
'Cause nothing on earth could be so fine  
I'm making you mine  
  
I think I might have found something  
And I think she might be my love  
  
Yes, I think I came across something  
And I think she might be my love  
  
'Cause nothing on earth could be so fine  
Oh---oh---oh---  
Yes, it must be love  
I've found out its worth, it must be love  
'Cause nothing on earth could be so fine  
I'm making you mine  
  
Ah, nothing on earth could be so fine  
Ah, nothing on earth could be so fine  
Ah, nothing on earth could be so fine
