I close my eyes to the sound in the sky and I see  
Birds in the trees and pastures green  
Nothing to do with the time or the place, I perceive  
The rush of the sea beneath my feet  
  
Such a lovely world, oh so magical  
Precious like a pearl, wrapped up in a shell  
Build your house of stone on a bed of sand  
Time and tide will rise, washing through your hands  
  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
  
I lift my eyes to the sound in the sky and I hear it  
The voice on the breeze is so serene  
Nothing to do with the time or the place but I feel it  
Like dust on the moon beneath my feet  
  
Such a lovely world, oh so magical  
So the story goes, sing the madrigal  
What a lovely world, waxing lyrical  
See the lies unfold, hear the miracle  
  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
  
So the story goes  
The lies and the miracle unfold
