It's all about the Pentiums, baby  
Uhh, uh - huh, yeah  
Uhh, uh - huh, yeah  
It's all about the Pentiums, baby  
It's all about the Pentiums, baby  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
Yeah  
  
What y'all wanna do?  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers  
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?  
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?  
Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard?  
Yeah, payin' the bills with my mad programming skills  
Defraggin' my hard drive for thrills  
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM  
I never feed trolls and I don't read spam  
Installed a T1 line in my house  
Always at my PC, double - clickin' on my mizouse  
Upgrade my system at least twice a day  
I'm strictly plug - and - play, I ain't afraid of Y2K  
I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him "Money" for short  
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support  
It's all about the Pentiums, what?  
You've gotta be the dumbest newbie I've ever seen  
You've got white - out all over your screen  
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato  
What kinda chip you got in there, a Dorito?  
You're usin' a 286? Don't make me laugh  
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?  
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette  
You're the biggest joke on the Internet  
Your database is a disaster  
You're waxin' your modem, tryin' to make it go faster  
Hey fella, I bet you're still livin' in your parents' cellar  
Downloadin' pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar  
And postin' "Me too!" like some brain - dead AOL - er  
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller  
You're just about as useless as jpegs to Hellen Keller  
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
  
Now, what y'all wanna do?  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers  
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?  
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?  
  
Uh, uh, loggin' in now  
Wanna run wit my crew, hah?  
Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?  
They call me the king of the spreadsheets  
Got 'em printed out on my bedsheets  
My new computer's got the clocks, it rocks  
But it was obsolete before I opened the box  
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?  
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique  
Your laptop is a month old? Well that's great  
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight  
My digital media is write - protected  
Every file inspected, no viruses detected  
I beta tested every operation system  
Gave props to some, and others? I dissed 'em  
While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'  
It does all my work without me even askin'  
Got a flat - screen monitor forty inches wide wide  
I believe that your says "Etch - A - Sketch" on the side  
In a 32 - bit world, you're a 2 - bit user  
You've got your own newsgroup, "alt. total - loser"  
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax  
Where'd you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?  
Play me online? Well, you know that I'll beat you  
If I ever meet you I'll control - alt - delete you  
What? What? What? What? What?  
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)  
Now, what y'all wanna do?  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers  
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?  
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?  
What??
