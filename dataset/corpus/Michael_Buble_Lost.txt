I can't believe it's over  
I watched the whole thing fall  
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall  
If I only knew  
The days were slipping past  
That the good things never last  
That you were cryin'  
  
Summer turned to winter  
And the snow, it turned to rain  
Then the rain turned into tears upon your face  
I hardly recognize the girl you are today  
And God I hope it's not too late  
It's not too late  
  
Cuz you are not alone  
I'm always there with you  
And we'll get lost together  
Till the light comes pouring through  
When you feel like you're done  
And the darkness has won  
Babe you're not lost  
  
When your world's crashing down  
And you can't bear the thought  
I said babe you're not lost  
  
Life can show no mercy  
It can tear your soul apart  
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy  
But you're not  
Though things have seemed to change  
There's one thing that's still the same  
In my heart you have remained  
And we can fly, fly, fly away  
  
Cuz you are not alone  
I am there with you  
And we'll get lost together  
Till the light comes pouring through  
When you feel like you're done  
And the darkness has won  
Babe you're not lost  
  
When your worlds crashing down  
And you can't bear the thought  
I said baby you're not lost  
  
Mmmm yeah yeah, yeah yeah,  
I said baby you're not lost.  
I said baby you're not lost.  
Oh yeah, yeah  
I said baby you're not lost.
