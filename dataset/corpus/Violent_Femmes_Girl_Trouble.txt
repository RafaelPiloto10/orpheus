Have mercy on me  
I got girl trouble up the ass  
Have mercy on me people  
I got girl trouble up the ass  
  
And don't tell me no joke  
'Cause I'm not gonna laugh  
I need the cure  
Only one cure in this world  
  
I need the cure  
Only one cure in this world  
Hey james brown  
I need a woman or a girl  
  
Hit me in the morning  
Hit me in the night  
Hit me when I'm wrong  
Hit me when I'm right  
  
Hit me when I'm up  
Hit me when I'm down  
Hit me hit me hit me hit me  
All over town  
  
Girl trouble  
I got girl trouble up the ass  
And don't tell me  
'Cause I'm not gonna laugh  
  
I'm not trying to fool you people  
I'm not giving you no jive  
Make me feel I'd rather be dead than alive  
Take a look around  
  
What's shoving up my behind  
Problems drive me out of my mind  
Girl trouble  
I got girl trouble up the ass  
  
And don't tell me no joke  
'Cause I'm not gonna laugh
