Oh-oh, oh yeah  
Remember love, remember you and me  
Remember everything we shared  
On this planet when we cared  
Remember hearts, remember unity  
Remember loving neighbors without expecting favors  
  
Why be afraid to make an honest mistake  
If you acknowledge the pain  
And you wanna change, you can get through anything  
  
Do you remember at all  
People walking hand-in-hand  
Can we feel that love again  
Can you imagine at all  
If we all could get along  
Then we all could sing this song together  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Look at me and look at you  
Now look at me again  
See, we're not so different  
Look around, what do you see  
Were throwing thinks outside our window  
We don't care to keep it clean  
  
I had a dream that beauty was only skin deep  
And if we all just believe  
Love is all we need, nothing else can set you free, yeah  
  
Do you remember at all  
People walking hand-in-hand, hand-in-hand  
Can we feel that love again, can we feel love again  
Can you imagine at all, imagine at all  
If we all could get along  
Then we all could sing this song together  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh yeah  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye  
Singing, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah  
  
If we could through away the hate  
And make it last another day  
Don't give up just for today  
Life would be so simple  
And then they'd talk about us  
But they will never stop us  
We'll keep singing  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woo  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, come on, we'll keep singing  
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-yeah, whoa yeah  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh  
  
Do you remember at all  
People walking hand-in-hand, walking hand-in-hand  
Can we feel that love again  
Can you imagine it all, imagine, yeah  
If we all could get along  
Then we all could sing this song  
Together  
  
Ooh, come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah  
Hold your hand with your neighbors  
Together, together  
No, da, da-da-da, oh-yeah, oh  
Come and sing it with  
Looking at you, baby, oh, ooh-oh
