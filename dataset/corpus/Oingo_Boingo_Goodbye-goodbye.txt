Oh, I know something  
About the ways of loving  
And I tell you, baby,  
That something's wrong  
Look to the sky above and the mud below  
Something drives me crazy, got to got to get away  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye!  
  
Without a doubt, I'm telling you I'm burnt out  
My tank is running on empty for far too long  
Woah! I need fuel 'cause I'm getting so low  
Something drives me crazy, got to, got to get away  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye!  
  
I need fuel, just the kind you give me  
Makes me feel so bad  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye!  
  
I can't believe  
I'm still around  
It's getting kinda late  
Gonna leave  
For a change of scenery  
I'm going crazy  
It's not the same  
Since you've been around  
  
I'm crazy, so crazy  
You treat me like a dirty clown  
You're always kickin' my dog around  
I never get nothin' but constant abuse from you  
You couldn't care less what I think, or my point of view  
  
You're always puttin' the make on my friends, always giving  
Them eyes and the dirty lies 'bout me and you, well I'm  
Through, it's the end of the line for you babe, here's a  
Ticket one way Cincinnati, I'm sendin' you home to your ma  
And your daddy, so don't try to call me, you'll only be wastin' your  
Time!  
  
Oh, I know something  
About the ways of loving  
And I tell you, baby,  
That something's wrong  
Look to the sky above and the mud below  
Something drives me crazy, got to got to get away  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye!
