I just want to talk to you  
I won't uh, do you no harm  
I just want to know about your diff'rent lives  
On this is here people farm  
I heard some of you got your families  
Living in cages tall and cold  
And some just stay there and dust away  
Past the age of old.  
Is this true?  
Please let me talk to you.  
  
I just wanna know about  
The rooms behind your minds  
Uh do I see a vacuum there  
Or am I going blind?  
Or is it just uh, remains of vibrations  
And echoes long ago?  
Uh things like "Love the world" and uh  
Uh "Let your fancy flow"  
Is this true?  
Please let me talk to you  
Let me talk to you.  
  
I have lived here before  
The days of ice  
And of course this is why  
I'm so concerned  
And I come back to find  
The stars misplaced  
And the smell of a world  
That is burned  
A smell of a world  
That is burned.  
  
Yeah well, maybe, hmm...  
Maybe it's just a... Change of climate  
Hmm, hmm...  
Well I can dig it  
I can dig it baby  
I just want to see.  
  
So where do I purchase my ticket?  
I'd just like to have a ringside seat  
I want to know about the new Mother Earth  
I want to hear and see everything  
I want to hear and see everything  
I want to hear and see everything  
Yeah...  
  
Aww, shucks  
If my daddy could see me now  
Everything, everything, everything, oh everything.
