This is so hard for me  
To find the words to say  
My thoughts are standing still  
  
Captive inside of me  
All emotions start to hide  
And nothing's getting trough  
  
Watch me  
Fading  
I'm losing  
All my instincts  
Falling into darkness  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls for me now  
  
So much uncertainty  
I don't like this feeling  
I'm sinking like a stone  
  
Each time I try to speak  
There's a voice I'm hearing  
And it changes everything  
  
Watch me  
Crawl from  
The wreckage  
Of my silence  
Conversation  
Failing  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls  
  
Every time you choose to turn away  
Is it worth the price you pay  
Is there someone who will wait for you  
One more time  
One more time  
  
Watch me  
Fading  
I'm losing  
All my instincts  
Falling into darkness  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls for me now  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
It's not too late for me  
Tear down these walls for me
