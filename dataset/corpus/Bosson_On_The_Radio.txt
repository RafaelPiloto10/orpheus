Someone found me a letter you wrote me on the radio  
And they told the world just how you felt  
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat  
They never said your name but i know just who they meant  
  
Woa woa  
I was so surprised and shocked and wondered too  
If by chance you heard it for yourself?  
I never told a soul just how i've been feeling over you  
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
[Chorus]  
On the radio oh oh oh  
On the radio oh oh oh...now now  
  
Don't it kind of strike you sad when you hear our song  
Things are not the same since we broke up last june  
The only thing that i want to hear is it that you love me still  
And that you think, you'll be coming home real soon  
  
Woho yeah it kinda' made me feel proud when i heard him say  
You couldn't find the words to say yourself  
And now in my heart i know i can say what i really feel  
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you think that love isn't found on on the radio  
Then tune right in you may find the love you lost  
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the girl i sent away long ago  
She finally realized he said it really loud on the radio  
  
[Chorus]
