DJ turn it up  
Let's go  
Three one two one  
It's loco right?  
  
Through the gates, knock on the door  
Put you're clothes in the pile on the floor  
Take you're pick from the Japanese robes and sandals  
Drink champagne from a glass with chocolate handles  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you wanna come? Three one two one  
Gonna be so much fun three one two one  
That's where the party be three one two one  
You can come if you want to,  
But you can never leave  
  
Look over there  
There's another turn-on  
Butterflies scared that they're going to be awake all night long  
Dancin' in you're belly  
Like a ballerina  
In spit of you're efforts to calm them down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
House party ya'll  
It's going down people  
Like the wall of Berlin  
  
Lock the door  
'Til you see the sun  
We gon' party like there ain't gonna be another one  
Futuristic fantasy  
This is where the purple party people be  
This is where the party be three one two one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's goin' down, people  
Like the wall of Berlin
