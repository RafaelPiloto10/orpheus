It was you who walked into my life  
You were the one  
You hear my cries of loneliness  
Through my cool cautious eyes  
Can't you see me reaching out for you  
Can't you feel me there  
Wont you please believe me  
I could never touch you for the fear  
That I might never let you go  
  
It was you with the courage and the commitment  
To start your new life  
You make me believe in mine  
But can't you see the confusion  
Through my troubled smile  
I'm torn between losing me  
Losing me and gaining you  
  
Maybe I've been distant  
Maybe I've been cold  
But I've done it for my own existence  
And I do believe I do believe its getting old  
  
I might never say that I love you  
I might never say I care  
But I will tell you now  
That Ill always be there
