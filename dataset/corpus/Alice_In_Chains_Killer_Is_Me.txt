  
  
  
Don't need a gun  
Pointed at me  
Don't need to run  
Killer is me  
Killer is me  
So the sun  
Shines upon me  
Having fun  
Killer is me  
Insane the mind  
In the name of me  
Can't find the time  
To let things be  
Insane the mind  
In the name of me  
Can't find the time  
To let things be  
Let things be  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
And get over it  
So the sun  
Shines upon me  
Having fun  
Killer is me  
Killer is me  
Killer is me  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
And get over it  
Let things be  
Jerry: "Thank you!"  
"Thanks, that was really fun..."  
Layne: "I wish I could just hug you all! But I'm not gonna..."
