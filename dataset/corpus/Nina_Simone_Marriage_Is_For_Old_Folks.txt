I love dancing  
Crazy romancing  
Fellas advancing constantly  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Old folks, not for me!  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life!  
  
I love singing  
Good healthy clinging  
Quietly bringing on a spree  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks!  
One married he  
One married she  
Whaddya got?  
Two people watchin' tv!  
  
I'm not ready  
To quit bein' free  
And I'm not willing  
To stop being me  
I've gotta sing my song  
Why should I belong  
To some guy who says  
That I'm wrong?  
  
Doo doo dooo  
De doo de doo  
De-doo de-doo  
Doo doo doo  
Dooo  
  
Cookin' dinner  
Lookin' no thinner  
Gray elbows and  
A sudsy sea  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Cold folks,  
And it's not for me!  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life!  
  
I'm exploding  
With youth and with zest  
Who needs corroding  
In some vulture's nest?  
I've gotta fly my wings  
Go places, do things  
My freedom bell's really  
Gonna ring!  
  
Doo doo dooo....(etc.)  
  
I've been through years  
Too many blue years  
Now I want New Year's every eve  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
One husband  
One wife  
Whaddya got?  
Two people sentenced for life  
  
Marriage is for old folks  
Marriage is for cold folks  
Not for me  
Can't you see  
Marriage ain't for me
