Just take it take it.  
Just take it take it.  
  
I know what you do,  
Flash me.  
The way it's done,  
Impolitely.  
Just tying to find,  
Some alone time.  
No room to compromise.  
  
Just take it take it.  
Can't take it take it.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be worried for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.  
I'll get by,  
In this life,  
This time.  
  
Take your best shot,  
And press me.  
Write a fictional story,  
For your fee.  
Try to get the world,  
To believe.  
Shocking hell I surprise.  
  
Just take it take it.  
Can't just take it take it.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be sorry for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.  
I'll get by,  
In this life,  
This time.  
  
You see me,  
I see you.  
You're over there.  
You see me,  
I see you.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be sorry for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try to,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from shit.  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.
