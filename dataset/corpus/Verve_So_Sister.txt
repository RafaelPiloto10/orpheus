I wrote your name in dust on a truck  
As it rolled out of town  
Just in case my love for you  
Might be found  
I cried my tears in a mountain stream  
They'll sting you one day  
I called your name in a giant cave  
It echoes to this day  
  
So sister, you're hearing how I miss her  
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls  
So sister, you're hearing how I miss her  
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls  
No, I don't think that I'm helping my cause  
  
I wrote our names on a subway wall  
Just in case you called  
I rent a room and it's just for two  
But where are you?  
  
So sister, you're hearing how I miss her  
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls  
So sister, you're hearing how I miss her  
But I don't think that she's helping my cause  
No I don't think that I'm helping my cause  
No I don't think that I'm helping my cause  
No I don't think that I'm helping my cause  
  
So sister, you're hearing how I miss her  
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls  
So sister, I need to be with her  
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls  
No, I don't think that I'm helping my cause  
No, I don't think that I'm helping my cause
