I went to a Turkey roast down the street  
The people down there are eatin' like wild geese  
So I'm on my way I'm goin' back in Alabam  
Well you talk about your people havin' a lot of time  
Eating up their chickens and drinkin' their wine  
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam  
Now some folks say that a tramp won't steal  
But I caught three in my corn field  
And I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam  
Well one had a bushel and one had a peck  
And one had a roaster near tied around his neck  
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam  
  
Well there comes Sal walkin' down the street  
With the run down shoes tied on her feet  
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam  
When I get ready to leave this earth  
I'm going back to my money's worth  
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam
