Wake up Suzy, put your shoes on,  
Walk with me into this light, oh,  
Finally this morning,  
I'm feeling whole again,  
It was a hell of a night.  
Just to be with you by my side,  
Just to have you near in my sight.  
Just to walk a while in this light,  
Just to know that life goes on.  
  
Wake up Suzy, put your shoes on,  
Walk with me into this light.  
  
Another night has gone,  
Life goes on,  
Another dawn is breaking.  
Turn and face the sun,  
One by one,  
The world outside is waking.  
Morning light has driven away all  
The shadows that hide your way.  
And night has given away to  
The promise of another day.  
  
Another day, another chance  
That we may finally find our way.  
Another day, the sun has begun  
To melt all our fears away.  
Another day, another day.  
  
Oh, wake up Suzy, put your shoes on,  
Walk with me into this light.
