When I sleep  
I slide into  
Some heaven  
But no one is there.  
  
If I believed,  
If I should wonder,  
If I forgive  
Then would you come for me?  
  
When I sleep  
I hear sad words  
Songs of god  
That show me the lie.  
  
'I'll keep you safe,  
I'll keep you warm and  
I'll keep you here,  
Alone forever.'  
  
And I believe in faith and magic.  
And I believe in love and wonder.  
And I'll believe in you when you come for me.  
And I'll believe in you when the world comes apart
