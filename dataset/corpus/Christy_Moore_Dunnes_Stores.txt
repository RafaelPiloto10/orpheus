Close your eyes and come with me back to 1984  
We'll take a walk down Henry Street to Dunnes  
Department store.  
The supermarket's busy and the registers make a din'  
The groceries go rolling out and the cash comes rolling  
In.  
  
Mary Manning is at the checkout and she's trying to  
Keep warm,  
When a customer comes up to her with a basket on her  
Arm  
The contents of the basket Mary's future is to shape  
But the label clearly stated "Produce Of The Cape"  
  
I can't check out your oranges Mrs, now won't you bring  
Them back.  
For they come from South Africa, where White oppresses  
Black  
I'd have it on my conscience and I couldn't sleep at  
Night  
If I helped support the system that denies Black  
People's rights  
  
Our union says "Don't Handle Them. It's the least that  
We can do.  
We Fought oppression here for centuries, we'll help  
Them fight it too"  
The managers descended in an avalanche of suits  
And Mary was suspended cos she wouldn't touch the  
Fruits.  
  
Chorus:  
Dunnes Stores Dunnes Stores  
Dunnes Stores with St Bernard Better Value Beats Them  
All  
  
Well, her friends are all behind her and the union gave  
Support  
And they called a strike and the pickets brought all  
Dunnes' Stores to a halt  
No one was going to tell the Boss what he bought or  
Sold  
These women are only workers, they must do as they are  
Told.  
  
Isn't it just typical of a partite screwball law?  
It's not just in South Africa, the Rich Temple and the  
Poor.  
He wouldn't have a boycott, he couldn't give a tinker's  
Curse  
Doesn't matter how he fills the shelves as long as he  
Lines his Purse  
  
Chorus  
  
The messages came rollin' in from all around the world  
For such concern and sacrifice and for courage brave  
And bold.  
When 14 months were over, 10 women and a man  
Had helped to raise the consiousness all around the  
Land.  
  
Cleary's in O'Connell street wouldn't sell South  
African shoes.  
Best Man sent all their clothes back, Roches Stores  
Sent back their booze.  
Until all South African goods were taken off the  
Shelves in Dunnes.  
And Mary Manning was down in Henry Street sticking to  
Her guns  
  
Chorus
