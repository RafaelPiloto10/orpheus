When you pass through the waters, I will be with you  
And the waves, will not overcome you  
Do not fear, for I have redeemed you  
I have called you by name, you are Mine

For I am the Lord your God (girls repeat)

(Guys) I am the Lord  
(Girls) Do not fear

When you pass through the fire, you'll not be hurt  
And the flames will not consume you  
Do not fear, for I have redeemed you  
I have called you by name, you are Mine
