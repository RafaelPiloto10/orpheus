Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better  
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come around  
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see  
  
He calls me over, calls me brother and I know  
Always fighting and moonlighting, it never ends  
In the city, if you're all alone  
There's a sister and she's standing next to her man  
In the darkness you feel the sharpness of steel  
And it's always there, in the city, if you're all alone  
  
Reach out, hands in the air, don't care just what they're saying  
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better  
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come around  
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see  
  
If it's gonna get better, it starts with a feeling  
If it's gonna get better, it's gonna take time  
If it's gonna get better, we've gotta start now  
'Cause I know everybody can feel it  
And I know everybody will see it  
'Cause it shows, and that shows I'm not dreaming  
'Cause you know, I know, it's time for a change
