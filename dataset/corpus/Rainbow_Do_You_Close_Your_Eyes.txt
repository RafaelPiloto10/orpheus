Oh na na na na  
Mystery in me is something i can't see  
But i see you very well  
You slippy, cool, nobody's fool  
But there's something inside i can't tell  
  
I know a poor man, a rich man  
I know i can talk to a king  
But nobody here is gonna tell me  
I can't find out one thing  
  
I see your glow around you  
Open your arms 'cause i'm walking to you, come straight or through  
Maybe i'm wrong but i know it won't take long to see  
  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah  
Making sweet love to me, yeah  
  
The logical friend said that i know in the end  
The things that make me smile  
To right from the start, i take the image of your heart  
And know it all the while  
  
I know a rich man, a poor man  
I know i can talk to a king, yeah  
So nobody here is gonna make me believe  
I can't find out one thing  
  
I see your glow around you  
Open your arms 'cause i'm coming, running, straight or through  
I could be wrong but i know it won't take long to see  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah  
  
Do you close your eyes  
Do you close your eyes, i've gotta know  
Do you close your eyes when you making love
