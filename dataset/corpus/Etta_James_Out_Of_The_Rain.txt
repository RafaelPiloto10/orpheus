Out of the rain, under the shelter  
I've been so long where the sun don't shine  
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way  
But now I've found you and the storm is behind  
  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  
  
Over the wall, I'm out in the open  
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain  
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles  
I can see a long ways I feel love again  
  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  
  
There was a time I was taking no prisoners  
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone  
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon  
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong  
  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  
Out of the rain, out of the rain
