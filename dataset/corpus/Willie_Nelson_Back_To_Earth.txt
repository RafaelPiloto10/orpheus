I guess my heart has settled back to Earth.  
I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth.  
But true love is both a blessing and a curse.  
Today my heart just settled back to Earth.  
  
Now I know just how you felt that night so long ago.  
But the dream for you had ended and you let me know.  
So I bounced from sky to sky,  
Tryin' to keep the dream alive.  
But everything I did just made it worse.  
Guess my heart just settled back to Earth.  
  
Love created songs that I still sing.  
Love we knew still makes the rafters ring  
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.  
  
Songs our love created I still sing.  
Love we knew still makes the rafters?red?.  
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.  
  
Our song will never have a final verse,  
Our hearts just finally settled back to Earth
