In my neighborhood  
We don't live so good  
The rooms are small  
And the buildings made of wood  
  
I hear the neighbors talking 'bout you and me  
I guess I heard it all  
'Cause the talk is loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
He don't really love her  
That's what I heard them say  
He sure wasn't thinking of her today, oh no  
(He wasn't thinking of her today)  
  
I saw them in the front yard  
Said the boy in room one four nine  
He was talking to a girl I've never seen before  
And standing there together, oh, they looked so good  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(I don't want to hear it)  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(Anymore)  
'Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
Ain't it sad, said the woman down the hall  
That when a nice girl falls in love  
Ain't it just too bad that she had to fall  
For a boy who doesn't care for her at all?  
(It's so sad)  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(I don't want to hear it)  
I just can't stand to hear it anymore  
(Anymore)  
'Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore  
(Can't stand to hear it)  
(Don't want to hear it)  
I just can't stand to hear it anymore  
(Don't talk about it)  
(Can't stand to hear it)  
Oh, baby, baby  
I just can't stand
