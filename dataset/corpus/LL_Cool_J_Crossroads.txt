The wind is howlin'  
The rain pours down  
Eyes are blood-shot  
Heartbeat pounds.  
Lights go out  
The whole world's in darkness  
The ground is tremblin'  
Dogs are barkless.  
In the sky there appears a great light  
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night.  
Cryin' in a childless tone  
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone.  
Don't smile  
Lest a innocent Chile  
The power of God is gonna get to be your Tao  
Throw like a hit from the best  
Take it in a slump  
Ha ha  
Feel it in your chest.  
Conquering the world with the words  
Leading the children like herds.  
I can feel it building  
I'm about to explode  
I'm walking on the crossroad  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
People living in a shack, at the crossroads  
Little kids selling crack, at the crossroads  
Stab you in the back, at the crossroads  
Everybody's getting jacked at the crossroads  
  
Violins and trumpets play  
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh  
On there way to the promise land.  
Deliverance  
But yet some don't understand.  
Rough on a late night thrill  
After midnight  
Kill or be killed.  
Soldiers, warriors  
At each other  
On the combat zone.  
Supreme power on the throne.  
Lighting strikes in every home.  
Terrified men run down the street.  
So many dead bodies  
It's hard to eat.  
Come, we gotta rise  
Above the wall.  
To see what no man has seen before.  
Blindin' light  
That got you through the night.  
God is on your side  
To got in a fight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Homicide  
Suicide  
Death.  
Boom!  
Ain't nobody left.  
Oh! It's starting to take affect.  
Your on your knees  
You scared to death.  
Tornado's with a thousand people spinning.  
One fight at the cross  
And now God is wining.  
The whole Earth cracks in half.  
The sea turns red from the blood bath.  
Abandoned buildings burned  
And two remain  
Terrified.  
You feel the fire blaze.  
The ground can't hold your weight.  
You reach out to grab the pearly gates.  
Who clocked this fuck  
Not from space.  
Never again  
Will you see the human race.  
19 angels leading the Devil straight to Hell!  
Torment!  
Pain!  
What you're seeing here  
You can't explain.  
All your life  
Some men  
We played the game.  
Never realize that there's a flame.  
  
[Chorus]
