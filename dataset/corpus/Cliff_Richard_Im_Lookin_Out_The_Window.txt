Im looking out the window  
Im waitin at the door  
To see if youll be coming by  
The way you did before  
The way you did before  
  
You told me you were taken  
But now you've set me free  
And I believed you when you said  
Your only love was me  
Your only love was me  
  
I bought a silk to please you  
I wear it every day  
I wear it just a in case you'll call  
I wore it yesterday  
I wore it yesterday  
  
I hear them talk about you  
They say youre like the rest  
They say youll never break away  
And Im just second best  
And Im just second best  
  
Im looking out the window  
Im waitin at the door  
And hopin youll be coming by  
The way you did before  
The way you did before
