Sittin' on my own  
Chewin' on a bone  
A thousand million miles from home  
When something hit me  
Somewhere right between the eyes  
  
Sleepin' on a plane  
You know you can't complain  
You took your last chance once again  
I landed stranded  
Hardly even knew your name  
  
I want to talk tonight  
Until the mornin' light  
'Bout how you saved my life  
You and me see how we are  
You and me see how we are  
  
All your dreams are made  
Of strawberry lemonade  
And you make sure I eat today  
You take me walking  
To where you played when you were young  
  
I'll never say that  
I won't ever make you cry  
And this I'll say I don't know why  
I know I'm leavin'  
But I'll be back another day  
  
I want to talk tonight  
Until the mornin' light  
'Bout how you saved my life  
(You saved my life)  
I want to talk tonight  
(I want to talk tonight)  
'Bout how you saved my life  
(I want to talk tonight)  
'Bout how you saved my life  
(I want to talk tonight)  
'Bout how you saved my life  
(I want to talk tonight)  
'Bout how you saved my life  
(I want to talk tonight) (4x)
