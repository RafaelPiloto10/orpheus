Bandmaster  
Ladies and Gentlemen the Chicago Theatre is proud to announce a first, the
first time anywhere there has been an act of this nature. Not only one little
lady but two you've read about them in the papers and now here they are.
Chicago's own killer dillers, those sintilating sinners Roxie Hart and Velma
Kelly.  
  
Roxie and velma  
You can like the life you're living  
You can live the life you like  
You can even marry Harry  
But mess around with Ike.  
  
And that's good  
Isn't it grand?  
Isn't it great?  
Isn't it swell?  
Isn't it fun?  
Isn't it.  
But nothing stays.  
In 50 years or so, it's gonna change ya know.  
But oh its heaven, nowadays.  
  
Bandmaster  
Ok you babes of jazz. Lets pick up the pace. Lets make the parties longer,
lets make the skirts shorter. Lets all go to hell in a fast car and keep it
hot.  
  
Roxie and velma  
And all that jazz!
