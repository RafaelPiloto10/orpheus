Rainclouds came and stole my thunder  
Left me barren like a desert  
But a sunshine girl like you  
It's worth going through  
I will never be embarrassed about love again  
Tortured winds that blew me over  
When I start to think that I'm something special  
  
They tell me that I'm not  
And they're right and I'm glad and I'm not  
I will never be embarrassed about that again.  
  
Oh baby I'm dreaming of monday,  
Oh baby will I see you again  
Oh baby I'm dreaming of monday.
