Well, I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas  
Well, a little place called Hamburger Den  
I heard that old jukebox start playin'  
A tune called truck driving man  
  
The waitress then brought me some coffee  
I thanked her but called her again  
I said that old song sure does hit me  
'Cause I'm a truck driving man  
Pour me another cup of coffee  
For it is the best in the land  
I put a nickel in the jukebox  
And played the truck driving man  
  
I climbed back aboard my old semi  
And then like a flash I was gone  
I got them old truck we used to roll in  
Now I'm on my way to San Antone  
  
When I get my call up to glory  
They'll take me away from this land  
I'll head this old truck up to heaven  
'Cause I'm a truck driving man  
  
Well, pour me another cup of coffee  
For it is the best in the land  
I put a nickel in the jukebox  
And play the truck driving man
