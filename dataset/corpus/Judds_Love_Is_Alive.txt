Love ain't a candle  
It doesn't burn for one night  
And need the dark to shine  
Love is alive  
  
And love ain't just a word  
In every dictionary  
With no where defined  
Love is a man and he's mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is alive  
And at our breakfast table  
Everyday of the week  
Love is alive  
And it grows everyday and night  
Even in our sleep  
Love is alive  
And it's made a happy woman out of me  
Oh, love is alive  
And here by me  
  
Love ain't just a moon  
A distant far away dream  
That needs the night to rise  
Love is alive  
And love ain't just a song  
Sweet words of music  
To go dancin' by  
Love is a man and he's mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is alive, here by me
