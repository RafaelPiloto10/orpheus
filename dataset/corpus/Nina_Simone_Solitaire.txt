Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,  
Dealing out the cards from left to right,  
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me  
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.  
  
Love was just another game for two,  
I see now that's all it meant to you,  
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,  
So I'm all alone playing solitaire  
  
In each romance there's an element of chance,  
A gamble to win or to lose,  
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,  
Just made for fools.  
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,  
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,  
And until you wanna share that old feeling,  
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.  
  
And until you want to share that old feeling,  
I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire.
