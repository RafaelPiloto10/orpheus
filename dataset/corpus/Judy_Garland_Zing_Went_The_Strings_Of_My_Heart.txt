Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start  
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Your eyes made skies seem blue again  
What else could I do again  
But keep repeating through and through  
"I love you, love you"  
  
I still recall the thrill, guess I always will  
I hope 'twill never depart  
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still recall the thrill, I guess I always will  
I hope 'twill never depart  
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine  
Zing! Oh, Oh, Oh went the strings of my heart
