You act like you wanna listen when I'm talkin' to you  
You think you oughta do baby, anything you wanna do  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be, outta your mind  
As long as I'm payin' the bills  
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss  
  
I'll drink if I wanna, and play a little poker too  
I don't want to hear nothin' from ya  
As long as I'm takin' care of you  
As long as I'm workin' baby, payin' all the bills  
I don't want no mouth from you 'bout the way I'm supposed to live  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be, outta your mind  
As long as I'm footin' the bill  
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss  
  
Now that you got me huh, you act like you're ashamed  
You don't act like my man - you're just usin' my name  
I'm gonna have all the money baby  
I don't want no back talk  
You don't like how I'm doin'  
You can pick up your things and walk  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be, outta your mind  
As long as I'm payin' the bills  
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
