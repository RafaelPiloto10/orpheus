That's me in the corner  
That's me in the spotlight, losing my religion  
Trying to keep a view

The things you say  
You're unbelieveable  
(Oh!)  
  
Do me, baby. Do me, baby  
You can do me in the morning, you can do me in the night  
You can do me when you want to do me

Exit light  
Enter night  
Take my hand  
Off to never never land

When I think about you I touch myself  
Oh, I don't want anybody else  
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no  
  
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood  
He's the one that makes you fell all right
