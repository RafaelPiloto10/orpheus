The king is dead  
No doubt about it  
We came a long way  
Just to say goodbye  
And in the end  
It was some old swansong  
The king is dead  
You'd never know it  
But we got pictures  
Of a different man  
He's flesh and blood  
No-one knows all the answers  
Some days we just do the best we can  
  
You changed my mind in a minute  
It breaks my heart to admit it  
Don't make me say...  
  
The king is dead  
The show is over  
We came a long way  
Just to turn around  
Lesson learned  
No-one knows all the answers  
Some days we just do the best we can  
  
You changed my mind in a minute  
It breaks my heart to admit it  
Don't make me say...  
  
You let me in behind the lies  
But you're no use to me lifesize  
No-one's to blame  
  
Some days we just do the best we can
