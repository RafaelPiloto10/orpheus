Everybody's searching for something  
Something that they can call their own  
Wishing, hoping, waiting for empty skieds to open up  
But they don't  
What's up with all the obsession  
What's in and what's out  
That's what it's about  
Still we dream of better  
Fearing nothing's gonna ever be right, yeah  
All along, don't you know that you can't break free  
Take a look and see what's your reality  
[Chorus:]  
Upside down, spining round and round  
Happiness may not be what it seems  
Inside out, alone whithout a doubt  
Is your heart until he sats you free  
From all of this reality  
Oh, you know the world is so crazy  
It'll chew you up, spit you out  
Leave you feeling empty inside  
Filling your head with little white lies  
Jesus is the only reason that my heart is free to say  
You could dream a thousand dreams and have a million things  
But nothing could replace the love that jesus gave  
Talk shows, ecstasy, horoscopes, dvd's, pop culture, magazines, chat rooms,
MTV  
Protein diets, internet, the story isn't over yet, the psychic network really
cares?  
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?!!!!  
[Chorus]
