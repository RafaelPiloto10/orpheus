I am a poor freezingly cold soul  
So far from where  
I intended to go  
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls  
So far from where I'm determined to go  
  
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love  
There is no way ...  
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love  
But you see, I've got no charm  
Mmm...  
  
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold  
Oh, this is very clear to you  
And you can tell I have never really loved  
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day  
  
And all of my life no-one gave me anything  
No-one has ever given me anything  
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye  
You must be such a fool  
To pass me by
