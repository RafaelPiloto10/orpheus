I've got a mind that you'll never see  
I've got amazing remedies  
I've got a heart that only wants to please  
You wouldn't notice if I slapped you and I  
  
Let go my friend  
Telling you I, Let go my friend  
You know I had to, let go my friend  
Telling you I, let go my friend as you  
  
Sail on by  
No girl is an island  
I live in denial as you  
Sail on by  
There's more behind this crying  
Than meets the eye  
  
I've got a hand on the radio  
I've got a song on the video  
I work my fingers to the bone  
You wouldn't notice  
If I were a slacker and I  
  
Let go my friend  
Telling you I, let go my friend  
You know I had to, let go my friend  
Telling you I, Let go my friend  
  
Sail on by  
No girl is an island  
I live in denial as you  
Sail on by  
There's more behind this crying  
Than meets the eye you  
  
Repeat chorus
