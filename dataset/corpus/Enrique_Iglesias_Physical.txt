Tonight we're going all the way  
You want my lips to kiss the pain away  
Body to body we can cause a flame  
We can ignite, ignite, ignite  
  
You wanna dance  
You wanna move  
I'm on a mission to just  
Take you to the moon  
  
We like to party  
We're in the moon  
So turn it up  
And let the music  
Get you loose  
  
We're feeling high  
Gimme that bass  
Just get them drinks  
And put yo' hand up  
In the air  
  
You know you want me  
So make a move  
Come over here  
And show me what you're gonna do  
  
Tonight we're going all the way  
You want my lips to kiss the pain away  
Body to body we can cause a flame  
We can ignite, ignite, ignite [x2]  
  
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical oh  
Physical, physical  
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical oh  
Physical, physical  
  
You make me fly  
I'm losing my head  
Don't let me come down  
Pump it up until the end  
  
The club is bumping  
Blow up the roof  
So never mind if we all get a little rude  
  
Move to the right  
Move to the left  
Now back it up you know just  
What you gonna get  
  
You know you like it  
I know you do  
So turn it up and let the beat  
Just get you loose  
  
Tonight we're going all the way  
You want my lips to kiss the pain away  
Body to body we can cause a flame  
We can ignite, ignite, ignite  
  
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical oh  
Physical, physical  
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical oh  
Physical, physical  
  
You wanna dance  
You wanna move  
I'm on a mission to just  
Take you to the moon
