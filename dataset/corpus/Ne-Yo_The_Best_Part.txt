Worst part about fighting with yourself  
Is that even if you win, you loose  
Can't place the blame on everybody else  
So I'm fighting with myself over you  
  
I should have played it different but I didn't know  
I never pictured you without me or you letting go  
I should have seen it coming  
I should have thought it through  
The best part of me has always been you  
And no apology can bring you back to me  
Feels like I'm suffocating, you are the air I'm breathing out  
I'm so down and can't move and I'm beating me up over you  
  
The worst part about fighting with yourself  
Is that even if you win, you lose, yeah  
Can't place the blame on everybody else  
So I'm fighting with myself over you  
Maybe it's better making you feel you were crazy  
Instead of just being the man to fight it  
And can't blame, you knew that I was cheating  
And I knew that you knew  
But when you call me on it  
I just turned around on you  
Begging you don't let go  
... Confusion, confusing you of not trusting me  
All I'm doing wrong, so I sit around fighting myself all day long
