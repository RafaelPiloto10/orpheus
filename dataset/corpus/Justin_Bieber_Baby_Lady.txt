Put me in a outfit from the gap like that. One that  
Matches  
With the jacket and the cap like that.  
Then slap me in the stroller with the bounce like that.  
With the bottle full of milk that's 40 ounce like that.  
I'm your b-baby lady.  
Tina - I wanna push you in the buggy.  
I'm your b-baby lady,  
I wanna hold you like a Snuggie.  
You're my baby, lady.  
Tina - And I'm your lady, baby.  
It's time to roll,  
Let's go to the park.
