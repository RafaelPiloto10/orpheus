[Intro]  
I love to be a British queen  
I am Victoria, you see  
Now where's my British butler  
With my British cup of tea?  
Tea is not from Britain, ma'am  
From India it was brought  
Yes, for your cuppa, thousands died  
And many wars were fought  
  
[Chorus]  
British things, my British things  
It seems that tea is not  
British things, my British things  
Can I sweeten it a jot?  
  
[Verse 1]  
Do tell me sugar's British though  
No, it's Caribbean imported  
For sugar in your cup of tea  
Slavery's been supported  
I know it's wrong, your majesty  
But slaves in Africa  
Worked hard in fields of sugar cane  
To sweeten up your char  
  
[Chorus]  
British things, ah British things  
I thought that there were many  
British things, ah British things  
  
Afraid there's hardly any  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know your British cotton vest  
What's wrong with it?  
Explain!  
The cotton's from America  
And picked by... slaves again!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Your empire's built on fighting wars  
That's how your income's swollen  
Your British things are from abroad  
And most are frankly stolen  
  
[Hook]  
Whatever next? Go on! Pray tell!  
Our British queen is foreign as well?  
  
[Verse 4]  
It's true, I am of foreign descent  
And your husband, Albert? A German gent!  
At least I've got a British name  
Victoria's Latin... that's a shame!  
  
[Chorus]  
British things, ah British things  
There are no, we declare  
All our favourite British things  
Seem to come from elsewhere!
