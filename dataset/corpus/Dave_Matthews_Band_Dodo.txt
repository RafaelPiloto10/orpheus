Once upon a time  
When the world was just a pancake  
Fears would arise  
That if you went too far you'd fall  
But with the passage of time  
It all became more of a ball.  
We're as sure of that  
As we all once were when the world was flat  
  
So I wonder this  
As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure, oh  
Why would you play by the rules?  
Who did, you did, you  
Who did, you did, you  
  
When was she killed  
The very last dodo bird  
And was she aware  
She was the very last one  
  
So I wonder this  
As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure, oh  
Why would you play by the rules?  
Who did, you did, you  
Who did, you did, you  
You say who did, well you did, you  
  
If all the things that you are saying love  
Were true enough but still  
What is all the worrying about  
When you can work it out  
When you can work it  
  
Oh I wonder this  
As life billows smoke inside my head  
This little game where nothing is sure  
Why would you play by the rules?  
Who did, you did, you  
Who did, you did, you  
You say who did, well you did, it's you
