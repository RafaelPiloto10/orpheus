I am, taking a chance  
Walking with my laces loose  
Wrapped up, taking the maze  
That everybody's running through  
I'm sick of, black tie  
Nickel and dime  
We're going through the roof  
  
I'm not a wise man  
But I see the haze  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
  
There's a fine line  
You walk everyday  
'Cause somebody told you to  
A white lie  
You can't erase  
Now you're gonna have to choose  
  
You know a blind man  
Won't show the way  
But he can tell you  
What it's coming to  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni now  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni now  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni  
Ni ni ni ni ni ni ni ni now  
  
I'm not a wise man  
But I see the haze  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo  
Tearing it down  
Tearing it down  
Whoo, whoo
