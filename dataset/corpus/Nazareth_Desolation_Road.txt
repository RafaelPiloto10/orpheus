Locked up on Monday  
Lord I lost my way  
I couldn't breathe her name  
You know she's after my life  
Lately I'm stickin' to drinkin'  
And I'm headed down desolation road  
Habit -a- growin'  
Set it up just right  
I do away my life  
On a turn of the dice  
Lately I'm runnin' and hidin'  
Slidin' down desolation road  
(lead)  
No one to turn to  
Losing my best friend  
My name is just bad news  
And my account's in the red  
I'm in need of understandin'  
I'm landin' in desolation road
