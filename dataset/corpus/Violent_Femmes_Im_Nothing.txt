I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N  
I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N  
  
I'm nothing'  
I'm nothin'  
Are you a republican or a democrat  
A liberal fascist full of crap  
  
I'm nothin'  
I'm nothin'  
Somebody somewhere might be something  
But everybody everywhere  
  
Knows that I'm nothin  
Politics and dirty tricks  
I got no time for stones and sticks  
Politics and dirty tricks  
  
I got no time I'm chasing chicks  
I'm nothin'  
I'm nothin'  
Somebody somewhere might be something  
  
But everybody everywhere  
Knows that I'm nothing  
I'm nothing but I'm not proud  
'Cause being nothing it's not allowed  
  
Are you a gay or are you straight  
Do you believe in love  
Or do you believe in hate  
I'm nothin'  
  
I'm nothin'  
Somebody somewhere said he was something  
But to everybody everywhere  
I'm saying I'm nothing  
  
I'm nothing. I'm like a cloud  
I'm free to be alone in a crowd  
What's your reality. It's not real to me  
What's your anomaly. It is my destiny  
  
I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N  
I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N  
  
I'm nothin'  
Nothin'  
Nothin'  
  
I'm nothing now and I'll be nothing when  
This nothing world has it's nothing end
