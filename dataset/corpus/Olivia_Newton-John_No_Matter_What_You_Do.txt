(Olivia Newton-John)  
No matter what you do I'll send you love  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do I'll send you love  
Starting today  
I'm not lost  
I'm not scared  
I'm not frightened at all  
I'm just sad that you're feeling this way  
But no matter what you do  
I'll send you love anyway  
I started out with anger I was mad  
I started out afraid  
I had to let it go 'cause in your mind  
You felt betrayed  
You are lost  
You are scared  
You are frightened I know  
And I'm sad that you're feeling this way  
But no matter what you do  
I'll send you love anyway  
I found out  
Just what is important  
And I found out  
Who really loves me  
And I found out  
That trials like these make us grow  
So no matter what you feel I've done to you  
Know that my heart was true  
If reaping what you sow is real I know  
I planted in truth  
And I hope you find out  
That it's you that you're hurting  
It's time that you let it all go  
'Cause no matter what you do  
I'll send you love 'cause I know  
That if I lose it all  
I'll survive and I'll show  
From the fall I can grow and go on  
And I won't live in fear of the changes it makes  
'Cause I've learned what it takes to be strong  
So no matter what you do  
I'll send you love  
Oh no matter what you say  
Oh no matter what you do  
I'll send you love starting today  
I'm not lost  
I'm not scared  
I'm not frightened at all  
I surrender myself to my fate  
So no matter what you do I'll send you love  
Oh no matter what you do I'll send you love  
Oh no matter what you do I'll send you love anyway
