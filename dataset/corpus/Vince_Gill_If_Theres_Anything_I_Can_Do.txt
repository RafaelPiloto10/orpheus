Baby I'm so sorry your world came crashing in  
It's times like these you need a friend  
You don't have to worry it's out of our hands  
I believe that we're part of a much bigger plan  
  
[Chorus]  
If there's anything I can do  
Just call and I'll come runnin'  
I will always be here for you  
If there's anything I can do  
  
Your eyes are filled with sorrow  
Your heart is filled with pain  
Just let the tears fall down like rain  
I promise you tomorrow  
The sun is gonna shine  
All you can do is take it one day at a time  
  
[Chorus]
