Aww put our heads together  
Because a signature could change our future  
Uh-huh  
For some wrote you a letter begging you to reconsider  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea  
  
Put our heads together  
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices we'll blow you away  
  
So they put number on the television Mr. Gardner  
Oh yeah  
A messed up generation put the pressure on you  
You're a coward, uh-huh  
Yeah, yea-hey  
  
A messed up generation  
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhhh  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices we'll blow you away  
  
We can see right through you, we're awake  
Send your men and we are all awake  
Awake, awake, awake, awake  
Wake, awake, awake, awake  
  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices we'll blow you away  
Fear the voices, fear the voices, fear the voices, fear the voices
