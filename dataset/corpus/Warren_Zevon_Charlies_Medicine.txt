Charlie dealt in pharmaceuticals  
Charlie used to sell me pills  
Yesterday his sister called to tell me  
He'd been killed  
Some respectable doctor from Beverly Hills  
Shot him through the heart  
Charlie didn't feel a thing  
Neither of them did  
Poor kid  
Charlie dealt in pharmaceuticals  
He sold those expensive drugs  
I gave Charlie all my money  
What the hell was I thinking of?  
Charlie had to take his medicine  
Charlie got his prescription filled  
I came to say goodbye  
I'm sorry Charlie died  
I came to finish paying my bill  
I came to finish paying my bill  
I came to finish paying my bill  
I came to finish paying my bill
