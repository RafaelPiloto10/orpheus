Give me passion, I'll make it good  
I'm not crazy, just misunderstood  
And I want to be caught with you  
Oh yeah  
I've been framed all my life  
Didn't do it, I'm no enemy  
Now I want to be blamed with you  
Oh no  
  
Don't you make our love a crime  
Please don't make our love a crime  
If you do we'll all regret it in time  
So don't you make our love a crime  
  
You murdered just a part of me  
I'm still alive and breathin' free  
I want to be punished with you  
I know what you're goin' through  
You gave me a fatal bite  
I want to spend my time with you, you, you  
  
Don't you make our love a crime  
Please don't make our love a crime  
If you do we'll all regret it in time  
So don't you make our love a crime  
  
I know what you're goin' through  
It's happened to me once before  
And I know what you're gonna do  
I want to spend some time with you  
It's stronger than it was before  
And I've saved it up for you, you, you  
  
Don't you make our love a crime  
So please don't make our love a crime  
If you do we'll all regret it in time  
So don't you make our love a crime  
A crime, no
