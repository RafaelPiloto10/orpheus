I'm much wiser now  
A lifetime of memories  
Run through my head  
They taught me how  
For better or worse, alive or dead  
I realize there's no turning back  
Life goes on the offbeaten track  
I sit down with my son  
Set to see the Crimson Sunset  
Many years have come and gone  
I've lived my life, but now must move on  
He's my only one  
Now that my time has come  
Now that my life is done  
We look in to the sun  
"Seize th day and don't you cry,  
Now it's time to say good-bye  
Even though I'll be gone,  
I will live on"
