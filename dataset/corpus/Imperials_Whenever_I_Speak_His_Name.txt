All around there's hurried confusion  
The cares of life are pressing in  
All through the day,  
They try to steal my faith  
With words that hurt and deeds that block my way  
  
Ah, but that's when I remind myself who's child that I am  
And inside me there is strength to overcome  
And then I speak His name and the tension breaks  
And His love flows as a song to my heart  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I speak His name, I call upon His name  
And all the burdens of my heart... They roll away,  
I just breathe His name... I call upon His name  
And all the cares of this world... They roll away  
If God is for me, who can be against me?  
Whom shall I fear with God on my side?  
You see, Jesus and me, we are a majority...  
And no matter how big the mountain, it'll have to leave,  
  
Oh, so why should I be troubled and have anxiety,  
And let life's little problems bother me?  
Because He lives, I have His strength... And because He is that assures my
victory!  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I speak His name, I call upon His name  
And all the burdens of my heart... They roll away,  
I just breathe His name... I call upon His name  
And all the cares of this world... They roll away  
  
Tag:  
M m m they roll away  
They roll away  
They roll away hey hey  
They roll away  
Whenever I speak His name
