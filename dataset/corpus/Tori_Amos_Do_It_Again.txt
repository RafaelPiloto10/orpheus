In the mornin' you go gunnin'  
For the man who stole your water  
And you fire 'till he is done in  
But they catch you at the border  
And the mourners are all singin'  
As they drag you by your feet  
But the hangman isn't hangin'  
And they put you on the street  
Let's go  
  
Well you know she's no high climber  
Then you find your only friend  
In a room with your two-timer  
And you're sure you're at the end  
Then you love a little wild one  
But she brings you only sorrow  
All the time you know she's smilin'  
You'll be on your knees tomorrow  
  
You go back, Jack  
You go back  
Do it again  
Wheel's turnin' round and round  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
  
Now your swear and kick and beg us  
That you're not a gambling man  
Then you find you're back in Vegas  
With a handle in your hand  
Your black cards will make you money  
So you hide them when you're able  
In the land of milk and honey  
You must put them on the table  
  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
Wheel turning round and round  
You go back, Jack  
Do it again  
Back you go  
Come on to me  
Wheel turning round  
Beautifully  
Wheel turning round
