When summer's gone and winter's past  
It seems like a neverending way  
And thinking of what I have to say  
It seems like a neverending way  
I am within you now, with my sinful cry  
I am within you, now one am I  
Perish the love, perish your love  
When the sunfilled summer comes to love  
It seems like a neverending way  
It comes to us like a snow-white dove  
It seems like a neverending way  
I am within you now with my lonely cry  
I am within you now 'till the time we die  
I am within you now 'till the time we perish the love  
Perish your love
