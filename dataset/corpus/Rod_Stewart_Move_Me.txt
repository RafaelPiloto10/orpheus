It's obvious darlin'  
You've become allergic to me  
Are my trousers to wide?  
Do I drink and get mean?  
  
Is my demeanor that embarrassing?  
Are my jokes obsolete?  
Or is it my sweat  
That's no longer sweet?  
  
I work hard in the factory  
To keep you in luxury  
To which you've grown accustomed  
And you love  
  
Lately you don't light my fuse  
Is my fan belt coming loose  
Punch me in the Bible  
Baby please  
  
Move me, move me  
Move me when I'm home  
  
Sometimes baby  
I awake in the night  
I reach out to touch you  
But I'm scared you might bite  
  
A little emotion  
Wouldn't be out of place  
Wake up and love me  
Put a smile on my face  
  
Otis Redding said it best  
"Try a little tenderness"  
Aretha wanted more  
?Respect"  
  
Give me just a little touch  
That ain't really asking much  
Your dog gets more attention  
Than I do  
  
Move me, move me  
Move me when I'm home  
  
Sometimes I wonder  
If you'll miss me at all  
Emotionally independent  
As hard as a wall  
  
You're so wrapped up  
In your own little world  
Your old time religion  
Is your lunch with the girls  
  
When I'm standing next to you  
Even in a crowd  
I might as well be  
On another planet  
  
Tell me what I've done to you  
To justify this ridicule  
If it's over  
Why don't we forget it?  
  
Move me, move me  
(Soothe me, rock me)  
Move me when I'm home  
Why don't you move me, move me  
(Love me, rock me)  
Move me when I'm home?  
  
Why don't you rock me, love me  
(Move me, soothe me)  
Move me when I'm home?  
Why don't you rock me, move me  
(Rock me, soothe me)  
Soothe me when I'm home?
