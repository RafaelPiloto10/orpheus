Well, I see you standin' there  
With your finger in the air  
Ev'rything we do  
You want to leave it up to you  
  
Who do you think you are?  
You think you are a star  
Try'n' to run the town  
Always try'n' to put us down  
  
Well, you think that you're right  
You think you're out of sight  
Tell me something, mister  
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?  
  
Well, you say you've been try'n'  
You know that you're ly'n'  
I think you need some groovin'  
Who do you think you're foolin' now?  
  
Well, you better start changin'  
You life needs rearrangin'  
You better do some talkin'  
Or you better do some walkin' now  
  
Yeah, you think that you're right  
You think you're out of sight  
Tell me something, mister  
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?  
  
I know what you're doing,  
All that you been doin' wrong  
I don't know what you're feelin'  
Oh, but you been feelin' long  
  
Well, you think that you're right  
Tell me something, mister  
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?
