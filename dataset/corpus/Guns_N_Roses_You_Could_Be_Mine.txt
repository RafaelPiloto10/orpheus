I'm a cold heartbreaker  
Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two  
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed  
I'll be out the door before you wake  
It's nuthin' new to you  
'Cause I think we've seen that movie too  
  
'Cause you could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be mine  
  
Now holidays come and then they go  
It's nothin' new today  
Collect another memory  
When I come home late at night  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Just count your stars I'm home again  
  
'Cause you could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine  
  
You've gone sketchin' too many times  
Why don't you give it a rest  
Why  
Must you find  
Another reason to cry  
  
While you're breakin' down my back n'  
I been rackin' out my brain  
It don't matter how we make it  
'Cause it always ends the same  
You can push it for more mileage  
But your flaps are wearin' thin  
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'  
But this nightmare never ends  
Don't forget to call my lawyers  
With ridiculous demands  
An you can take the pity so far  
But it's more than I can stand  
'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older  
Tell me how long has it been  
'Cause five years is forever  
And you haven't grown up yet  
  
You could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be  
You should be  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine
