Chorus:  
Day to day  
You're the hi... Highlight  
Day to day  
You're the hi... Highlight  
  
You're the bright side of my darkness  
You remove my gloom  
You picked me up when times got rough  
I'm glad you had some room  
To love and hold me close to your heat  
To keep me safe and warm  
You're the height of my desire  
You set off my alarm  
  
Chorus  
  
I can't wait to see you  
From one moment to the next  
With you I never know what new thrill to expect  
Your perfect sense of timing  
Keeps me coming back for more  
You're the spark that lights my fire  
It's you that I adore  
  
Chorus
