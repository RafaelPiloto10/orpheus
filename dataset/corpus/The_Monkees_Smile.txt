By David Jones  
I wake to the sun shining,  
Orange and blue skies  
Oh, what a feeling deep inside,  
It's so hard for me to hide.  
You cannot imagine  
A feeling so different,  
You've come so far, you're at my door,  
You're knocking at my door.  
Won't you come inside and talk awhile?  
What I have to say may make you smile,  
Smile, smile, smile.  
I wake to the sun shining,  
Orange and blue skies  
Oh, what a feeling deep inside,  
It's so hard for me to hide.  
Won't you come inside and talk awhile?  
What I have to say may make you smile,  
Smile, smile, smile.
