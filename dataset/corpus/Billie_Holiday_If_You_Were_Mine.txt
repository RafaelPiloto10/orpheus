If you were mine  
I could be a ruler of kings  
And if you were mine  
I could do such wonderful things  
  
I'd say to a star  
Stop where you are  
Light up my lover's way  
And every star above you  
Would obey, say  
If you were mine  
  
I would live for your love alone  
To kneel at your shrine  
I would give up all that I own  
Yes even my heart  
Even my life  
  
I'd trade it all for you  
And think I was lucky too  
If you were mine
