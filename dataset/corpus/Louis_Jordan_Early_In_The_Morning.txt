Early in the morning and I can't get right  
Had a little date with my baby last night  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to all the places where we used to go  
I went to our house but she don't live there no more  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to your girlfriend's house but she was out  
I knocked on her mother's door and she began to shout  
"Get away, mad boy"  
  
Yes, early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to [Incomprehensible] to get something to eat  
The waitress looked at me and said  
"Pops, you sure look beat"  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues  
  
I had a lot of money when I started out  
Couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues  
  
In the morning  
Yeah, so early in the morning  
Come back to me, baby  
In the morning  
Early in the morning  
Come back to me, baby
