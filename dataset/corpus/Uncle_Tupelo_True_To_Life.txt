I can only sing it loud  
Always try to sing it clear  
What the hell are we all doing here  
Making too much of nothing  
Or creating one unholy mess  
An unfair study in survival, I guess  
  
But it always comes down to  
What to do when it's all around you  
And this tightwire act  
Leaving us here for dead to news of the world  
And liquor piles up ahead  
Dodging those with words of power  
Forever on their breath  
When the quality of life gets tripped upstrangled like death  
It seems it's getting harder out thereespecially without time enough to see  
  
True to life is another hangover  
True to life is more and more politics  
True to life is always having to look over your shouldertrue to life is
assembly-line sickness  
  
But it always comes down to  
What to do when it's all around you  
  
And this tightwire actleaving us here for dead to news of the world  
And liquor piles up ahead  
Dodging those with words of power  
Forever on their breath  
When the quality of life gets tripped upand strangled like death  
It seems it's getting harder out thereespecially without time enough to see
