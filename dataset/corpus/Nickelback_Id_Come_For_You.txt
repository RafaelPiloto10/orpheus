Just one more moment, that's all that's needed,  
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing  
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading,  
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it  
  
I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,  
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now  
Everyday I spend away, my soul's inside out,  
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
By now you know that I'd come for you  
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you  
But only if you told me to  
And I'd fight for you  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing,  
My mind was closing, now I'm believing  
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,  
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will  
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,  
I'd search forever just to bring you home,  
Here and now, this I vow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,  
Yes I'd come for you, but only if you told me to  
  
And I'd fight for you,  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you,  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way,  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
I'd crawl across this world for you,  
Do anything you want me to  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
You know I'd always come for you.
