Never had nothing  
No one to care  
That's why I seem to have  
More than my share  
I ve got a man crazy for me  
He's funny that way  
  
When I hurt his feelings  
Once in a while  
His only answer is one little smile  
I've got that man crazy for me  
He's funny that way  
  
I can see no other way  
And no better plan  
End it all and let him go  
To some better gal  
But I'm only human  
A coward at best  
I'm more than certain  
He'd follow me West  
  
Though he loves to work  
And slave for me everyday  
He'd be so much better off  
If I went away  
But why should I leave him  
He'd be unhappy without me I know  
I've got that man crazy for me  
He's funny that way
