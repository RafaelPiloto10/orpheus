Don't ask me how long baby it's gonna take  
I don't know honey, just give it a break  
Love don't happen to you overnight  
You got to feed it, leave it  
  
Give it some light  
Oh love, true love  
When it looks like you're winning  
Get it right on tee  
  
And the stars shine so brightly  
Just for you and me  
For ever and ever babe  
Is that what it takes?  
For ever and ever babe  
Is that when it stays for you and me?  
  
With every ray of sunshine sugar  
There's little bit of rain  
You got to take the bad times with the good times  
'Cause no love's the same  
  
Oh love, true love  
When it looks like you're winning  
Get it right on tee  
And the stars shine so brightly  
Just for you and me  
  
For ever and ever babe  
Is that what it takes?  
For ever and ever babe  
That's when it stays  
  
When you've found your star love will know just who you are  
For ever and ever she'll stay  
For ever and ever babe  
Is that what it takes?  
  
For ever and ever babe  
Is that when it stays?
