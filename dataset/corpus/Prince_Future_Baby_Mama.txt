I've heard it said my lovers look alike  
Could it be that I was looking for you  
They were cool but something wasn't right  
They had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth  
  
None of them got what it takes  
To be a future baby mama  
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break  
To keep your man  
  
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine  
With no more drama  
Future baby mama  
I've heard it said that I won't treat you right  
(U know that ain't right babe)  
But they ain't sure because they don't know nothing about you  
(U know what you want baby)  
You're too secure to ever want to fuss and fight  
(That's right)  
  
That's why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you  
Yeah I know you might be fine but I've seen it all before  
Cinderella was a waste of time and oops she's out the door  
To build a house together the thing that matters more  
  
Is under the floor  
A strong foundation that last forever more  
I want to make you happy, baby  
(Oh yes)  
Happier than happy itself  
(Oh yes)  
You know what?  
  
If you'll ever need a hand, call me I'll help  
Because I got you, anywhere you wanna go, uh  
(Oh yes)  
Paris, London, Africa, San Lucas Mexico, you see  
  
I know what you want  
What every good woman wants  
A man so in love with you  
He can't help but to flaunt you  
Deep down I know what you want  
You want your girlfriends to hate you  
Because they can't get your man
