A little piece in my life  
Is all I need to get me by  
But of course  
One or two more things  
Would make me satisfied  
  
But right about now  
I'm sitting down  
With a girl who think she's found  
Something more  
I don't know  
A little sister can't be sure  
(Listen)  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know that's not what love is  
So why can't I  
Keep mine and you keep yours?  
So we both know  
What we're still waiting for  
  
Just one more week  
Go back home  
Suburban life can't be that bored  
Take your pills  
Wash them down  
With some coffee and some crowns  
  
Just give me a kiss with your lips  
Can you let me grab your hips?  
Make me stop  
I don't know  
If I can do that on my own  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know that's not what love is  
So why can't I  
Keep mine and you keep yours?  
So we both know  
What we're still waiting for  
  
Here we are  
We're going through the motions  
Doesn't mean  
We're promising devotion  
Don't ask me  
Don't tell me, no  
This is love  
  
A cigarette is what I need  
'Cause after this I should believe  
This is love  
Understand  
That you'll have to tell your man  
(So just tell him)  
  
I just like kissing your lips  
My darling girl  
I know that's not what love is  
So why can't I  
Keep mine and you keep yours?  
So we both know  
What we're still waiting for [x2]
