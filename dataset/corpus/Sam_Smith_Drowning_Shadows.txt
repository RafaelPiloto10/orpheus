[Verse 1]  
Running around chasing hearts  
Chasing bodies to fix the parts  
I don't know how I reached this place  
So far from heaven, so far from grace  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I want to give in to the pressure  
Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me  
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems  
And I try to imagine something closer  
And somebody who is good for me  
I'm so tired of all this searching  
Do I, do I, do I, do I  
  
[Chorus]  
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?  
Give in to someone or lock down my door?  
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?  
Drowning shadows once more  
  
[Verse 2]  
The more I drink, the more I drown  
If I'm not thinking, I won't lay down  
The more I rise above it all  
The less I care about the fall  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I want to give in to the pressure  
Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me  
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems  
And I try to imagine something closer  
And somebody who is good for me  
I'm so tired of all this searching  
Do I, do I, do I, do I  
  
[Chorus]  
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?  
Give in to someone or lock down my door?  
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?  
Drown them shadows once more  
Once more  
Once more, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?  
Give in to someone or lock down my door?  
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?  
Drown them shadows once more
