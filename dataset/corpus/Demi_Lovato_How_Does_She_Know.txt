How does she know that you love her  
How Do you show her you love her  
How does she know that you really really truly love her  
It's not enuogh to take the one you love for granted  
You must remind her or she'll be inclined To say  
How do I know he loves me  
How do I know he's mine  
Well does he leave you a little note to tell you  
You are on his mind  
Does he send you  
Yellow flowers when the sky is gray yeah  
He'll find a new way to show you a little  
Bit everyday  
That's how you know that's how you know he's your love  
Everybody wants to live happily ever after  
Everybody wants to know that true love is true  
How do you know he loves you how do you know he's yours  
Does he take you out dancing just  
So he can hold you close  
Dedicate a song with words meant just for you  
He'll find a new way to show you with the little things he'll do  
That's how you know that's how you know he's you love  
He's you love  
That's haow you know  
How do you know  
How does she know that you love her  
How do you show her you love her  
How does she know that you really really truly love her  
That's how you know  
Because he'll wear your favorite color just so he canmatch your eyes  
Rent a private pinic by the fire glow oh oh  
His heart will be yours forever something everyday will show
