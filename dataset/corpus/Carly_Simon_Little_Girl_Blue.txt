When I was very young  
The world was younger than I  
As merry as a carousel  
The circus tent was strong with every star in the sky  
Above the ring I loved so well  
  
Now the young world has grown old  
Gone are the tinsel and the gold  
Sit there and count your fingers  
What can you do old girl, you're through  
Sit there and count your little fingers  
Unlucky little girl blue  
  
Sit there and count the raindrops  
Falling on you  
It's time that you knew  
All you can count on is the raindrops  
That fall on little girl blue  
No use old girl you may as well surrender  
You hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy  
To cheer a little girl blue  
  
No use old girl you may aswell surrender  
Your hope is getting slender  
Why won't somebody lend a tender  
Blue boy to cheer a little girl blue
