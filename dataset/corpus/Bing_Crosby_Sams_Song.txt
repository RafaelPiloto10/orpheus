Here's a happy tune you'll love to croon  
They call it Sam's song  
It's catchy as can be, the melody  
They call it Sam's song  
Nothing on your mind  
And then you'll find you're humming Sam's Song  
Why, it makes you grin  
Gets under your skin as only a song can do  
  
People that you meet out on the street  
All whistling Sam's Song  
Everyone you see will soon agree that it's a grand song  
So forget your troubles and wear a smile  
You'll find you never go wrong  
If you learn to croon this happy tune  
They call it Sam's song  
  
"And now another treatment of this  
Classic American Theme  
Brought to you by, Mr. Gary Crosby"  
  
Here's a happy tune  
(That'll bring you a smile all the while)  
(When you croon it you're really in style)  
And the title is Sam's Song  
It's catchy as can be  
(With a sly little beat)  
(And the melody sweet keeps you tapping your feet)  
And the title is Sam's Song  
  
Nothing on your mind  
(But the news of the day)  
(And the bills you must pay keep your hair turning gray)  
(But you're still humming Sam's Song)  
"Are you alright"  
"How's your brace"  
(Why, it makes you grin)  
(Gets under your skin as only a song can do)  
  
People that you meet  
(Hello Joe, what you know)  
(And remind me to Moe, tell him business is slow)  
(But I'm whistling)  
Sam's Song  
Everyone you see  
(Has a story to tell or a gimmick to sell)  
(But agree that it's swell)  
(And it's really)  
A grand song  
  
So forget your troubles and wear a smile  
You'll find you never go wrong  
If you learn to croon  
Like a lark in the park  
Who is making his mark serenading the dark  
With a chorus of Sam's song  
  
If you learn to croon the happy tune  
They call it Sam's song
