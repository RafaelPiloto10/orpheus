There she was  
Just a-walkin' down the street  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
Poppin' her fingers  
And shufflin' her feet,  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
She looked good,  
She looked fine,  
She looked good, she looked fine  
And I nearly lost my mind.  
Before I knew it  
She was walkin' next to me.  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
She took my hand  
Just as natural as can be,  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
We walked on,  
To my door,  
We walked on to my door,  
Then we kissed a little more  
I knew we were falling in love  
I told her all the things  
That I'd been dreamin' of  
Now we're together  
Nearly every single day,  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
We're so happy  
And that how we're gonna stay,  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
I'm hers  
She's mine  
Well I'm hers, she's mine  
Wedding bells are gonna chime  
I knew we were falling in love,  
I told her all the things  
That I'd been dreamin' of.  
We're togther  
Nearly every single day  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
And we're so happy  
And that how we're gonna stay  
Singin'  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do  
I'm hers  
She's mine  
I'm hers, she's mine  
Wedding bells are gonna chime  
Do-wah diddy-diddy down diddy-do
