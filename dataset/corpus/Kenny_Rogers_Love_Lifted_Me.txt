I was sinking deep in sin,  
Far from the peaceful shore,  
Very deeply stained within,  
Sinking to rise no more.  
But the Master of the sea  
  
Heard my despairing cry,  
From the waters lifted me.  
Now safe am I.  
  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help,  
Love lifted me.  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.  
  
Souls in danger look above  
Jesus completely saves  
He will lift you by his love  
Out of the angry waves  
  
But the master of the sea  
Billows His will obey  
He your savior wants to be  
Be saved today  
  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help,  
Love lifted me.  
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me.
