Love I'll help you to see  
The world is ours it used to be  
But now it's changed so much  
We have to change it back  
Soon will be a day  
When just a look will be to say  
Let's break away today  
Let's start again I'll tell you where  
I'll tell you when  
You came from out of the air  
And wrapped in fire  
  
Said don't you be scared  
Can't you use your life  
To save so many more  
Cast my pride away  
And had me born again that very day  
And now I'm so alive  
I'm comin' through  
They're teaching me to tell it to you  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  
Oh your hearts would say  
My mind is gone  
And ran away  
But who's the loser if you don't know  
What I have  
A job that's hard to beat  
Looking out for holey feet  
Treading softly on the ground  
Making waves but not a sound  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee
