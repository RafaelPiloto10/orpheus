No more tears  
I'm out of fears  
I'm out of pain  
I'm out in the rain  
  
It will gently wash away  
The light of the day  
  
I'm in love with the darkness of the night  
I'm in love with all that's out of sight  
I'm in love with the magic of the new  
And the darkness loves me, too  
  
Finally  
It covers me  
It makes me taste  
It's sure embrace  
  
It will gently take away  
The sorrows of the day  
  
Come out, come out wherever you are  
Don't hide, don't hide near or far  
Don't hide
