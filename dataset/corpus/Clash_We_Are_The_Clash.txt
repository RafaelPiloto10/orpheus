Punk rockers, hip-hoppers  
Brit poppers, show stoppers  
Beboppers, hair droppers  
Are you ready to sing?  
  
Right wing, left wing  
I want something  
To see me through (???)  
Bout what do you think  
  
We ain't gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
What?  
We are the Clash  
It's like a patch  
You can strike that match  
  
With my guitar now  
(???) last dance  
I see them where they (???)  
How they usually stay  
  
Beating on a drum  
Did they tell them 'take it in'  
Got the (???)  
Where the fat boy blew  
  
We ain't gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
That's right  
We are the Clash  
It's like a patch  
You can strike that match  
  
Home fires burnin'  
In motorcycle city  
The rockin' gods will choose  
If I'm worthy to live  
The first (???) engine  
(???) forty-six  
And there's no more (???)  
To imitate respect  
  
We ain't gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
Don't take no shit  
We are the Clash  
Do ya hear me?  
It's like a patch  
You can strike that match
