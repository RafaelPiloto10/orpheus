For all we know  
We may never meet again  
Before we go  
Make this moment sweet again  
We won't say goodbye  
Until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand  
And my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know  
This may only be a dream  
We come and go  
Like the ripples on a stream  
So love me tonight  
Tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come  
For all we know  
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come  
For all we know
