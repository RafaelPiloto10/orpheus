It cuts both ways  
Our love is like knife that cuts both ways  
It's driven deep into my heart each time  
That I realize  
How it cuts both ways  
Can't be together, cannot live apart  
We're heading straight into a broken heart  
But I can't stop  
'Cause I feel too much to let you go  
I'm hurting you and it's hard I know  
To stay and fight for what we've got  
Knowing it'll never be good enough  
'Cause you and I are dangerous  
We want too much and life ain't that way  
Don't ask for more, you'd be a fool  
Haven't we already broken every rule?  
It cuts both ways  
We're in too deep for sorry alibis  
Can't have regrets or even question why  
We can't say goodbye  
Because it cuts both ways  
No more illusions of the love we make  
No sacrifice would ever be too great  
If you would just stay  
'Cause I feel too much to let you go  
I'm hurting you and it's hard I know  
To stay and fight for what we've got  
Knowing it'll never be good enough  
'Cause you and I are dangerous  
We want too much and life ain't that way  
Don't ask for more, don't be a fool  
Haven't we already broken every rule?  
Cuts both ways  
Our love is like a knife that cuts both ways  
It's drivin' deep into my heart each time  
I see we livin' the lie  
And it cuts both ways  
It cuts both ways  
Cuts both ways  
Cuts both ways
