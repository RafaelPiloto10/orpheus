Madrid, Madrid  
Where is my love  
Why did you let me  
Leave my love  
  
At the airport in sunny Spain  
I had two hours to catch a plane  
I was lonely as I could be  
Until a senorita smiled at me  
  
There was music and sweet guitars  
And in her eyes were a million stars  
She was lovely beyond compare  
And in that moment  
I had learned to care  
  
She was to me, a serenade  
A melody that my heart had played  
And all too soon, I had to go  
She understood that I loved her so  
  
I waved goodbye, she waved goodbye  
And from my window, I could see her cry  
I went away and when I did  
I left my heart with her in old Madrid  
  
I waved goodbye, she waved goodbye  
And from my window, I could see her cry  
I went away and when I did  
I left my heart with her in old Madrid  
  
Madrid, Madrid  
Please tell my love that  
She is all I'm dreaming of
