Verse 1  
You fell away  
What more can I say  
The feelings evolved  
I won't let it out  
I can't replace  
Your screaming face  
Feeling the sickness inside  
  
Chorus 1  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Verse 2  
So many words  
Can't describe my face  
This feelings evolved  
So soon to break out  
I can't relate  
To a happy state  
Feeling the blood run inside  
  
Chorus 2  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Hook  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
Keep me down to what you think I should be  
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry  
Keep on trying I'm not dying so easily  
(I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
(I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
(I will not die)  
Chorus 3  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
Chorus 4  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine
