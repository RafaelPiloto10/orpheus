I got a one track mind  
I got a twisted heart  
I need a lesson in love  
I'm right on time  
For tonight's the night  
I need your love  
Oh yeah  
  
Caught in the act  
Had no alibi, no reason why  
To let you down, oh  
Stabbed in the back  
Though it hurt i let you go  
Will you take me back, oh  
What was right went wrong, oh  
It's alright to put the blame on me  
For after all blame it on my last affair  
It's alright, it takes two to make it love  
'cause love can be just a four letter word  
A four letter word  
  
I got a one track mind  
I got a twisted heart  
I need a lesson in love  
I'm right on time  
For tonight's the night  
I need your love  
  
Day turns to night  
I was wrong and you were right  
I feel like Mr. Hyde not Dr. J  
Sometimes I'm not myself  
I must be somebody else  
To jeopardize your love  
What went wrong was right, oh  
It's alright to put the blame on me  
For after all blame it on my last affair  
It's alright, it takes two to make it love  
'cause love can be just a four letter word  
  
I got a one track mind  
I got a twisted heart  
I need a lesson in love  
  
(thank you!)
