Who was it organizing the right  
To follow my leader  
Seems we look and stand around waiting  
For a sign from God  
Speaking for myself  
The christian need  
The Muslim need  
The Buddhist need  
To testify the need for brotherly love  
  
I know there's so many hundred things  
Things to talk about  
Making us laugh  
Just like a Shakespeare revolution  
Please organize our spiritual evolution  
Do that you'll feel it  
And we'll feel it  
Appreciate it's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
  
Saint or sinner  
Makes no difference in who you believe  
In a world of superstition  
Caught in a total nuclear greed  
  
Pioneers of the twenty first century  
Looking on and looking fast  
To try and fix and try and help  
This very need  
I know there's so many ways  
That we can work it out  
Whether we live or die  
  
Please organize the simple evolution  
so there's got to be  
so we can see  
to be free  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
  
So promised in a hundred letters  
Should be getting to you any time now  
So promised a surprise for you  
For getting so far from now  
It's almost like love  
The way the first one out discovers  
It's almost like  
How many times can you recover  
It's almost  
  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like love
