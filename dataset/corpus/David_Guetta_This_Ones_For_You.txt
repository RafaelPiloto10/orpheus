[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]  
We're born to fly  
So let's keep living 'til it all falls down  
Let's close our eyes  
And let the moment drive the whole world out  
  
[Chorus: Zara Larsson]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you  
This one's for you  
  
[Breakdown]  
  
[Verse 2: Zara Larsson]  
Waving colored flags  
We won't surrender, there's no standing down  
There's a playing field  
It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground  
  
[Chorus: Zara Larsson]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you  
This one's for you  
  
[Breakdown]  
  
[Bridge: Zara Larsson]  
In this together  
Woah, woah  
Oooooh  
  
[Chorus: Zara Larsson]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever  
This one's for you
