We started the tour out in Denver, Colorado  
I made the first one but I did not make the second show  
'Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change  
But I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name  
  
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to part  
Too many nights alone had left some permanence scars  
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same  
Then I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name  
  
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain  
Doc said son you can't do anymore of that cocaine  
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things  
But I od'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name  
  
I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real  
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feels  
She treated me nice and I like to find her again  
But I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name  
I brought it on myself, kinda overdid it in Denver  
And I just can't remember her name
