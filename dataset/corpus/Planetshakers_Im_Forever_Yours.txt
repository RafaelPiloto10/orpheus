(Verse 1)  
I give my all to you  
Send me and I will go for you  
To the ends of the earth  
I'll follow after you  
I want the world to know  
Your love endures forever  
  
(Verse 2)  
Tell me and I'll obey  
This is far greater than sacrifice  
Trusting you and not myself  
Will always lead to blessing  
Lord have your way in me  
Not my will, yours be done  
  
(Chorus)  
Here I stand within your presence  
Longing for your touch  
A thousand days cannot compare  
To one day in your courts  
  
Hold me now  
And never ever let me go  
My jesus, my precious saviour  
I'm forever yours  
  
(Bridge)  
I will worship you forever  
I will worship you (5x)
