Loaded  
Gonna have a good time  
Loaded  
Gonna have a good, good time  
Don't you know that I want to get loaded  
  
Lit  
Brighter than my butane  
I said lit  
Hotter than my low-down thing  
Take me inside-out, 'til I'm gone insane  
Well, oh yeah, shellac  
  
Loaded, loaded, locomotive  
Loaded, loaded, disembodied  
Let's fry  
Like a Paxton blower  
Like a Paxton twist  
Black Cadillac  
Aphrodesiac  
  
Loaded  
Tankin', skankin' with the rank-n-file  
Load me up  
Gettin' it good for a little while  
Don't you know that I want to get loaded  
Yeah, put me up  
  
Loaded, loaded, locomotive  
Loaded, loaded, don't you just know it  
Harpoon, loaded, well  
Like Bridgette Bardot  
Like a French high-roller
