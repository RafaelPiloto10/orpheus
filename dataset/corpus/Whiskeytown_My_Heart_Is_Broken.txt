My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
I live without you  
Your pillow cold  
I am forsaken  
I can't go on  
My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
If I hadn't cheated  
While you were gone  
The well that we'd  
Been drinkin from  
Wouldn't a dried  
And turned cold  
My days are empty  
My nights are long  
Five cups of coffee  
For the years gone wrong  
If I hadn't cheated  
While you were gone  
The well that we'd  
Been drinkin from  
Wouldn't a dried  
And turned cold  
My days are empty  
My nights are long  
My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
My love is gone
