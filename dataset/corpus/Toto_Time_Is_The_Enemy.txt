Those days we gave our all  
Unaffected  
I bravely faced the fall  
No reflection  
Freak armies of the night.  
Misdirected  
I fought the useless fight  
Unprotected  
  
Don't cry for me  
Time is the enemy  
Soon I'll be free  
I surrender  
Sweet moon, she marks the year  
Unreflected  
How sad she has no tears  
So neglected.  
  
Don't cry for me  
Time is the enemy  
Soon I'll be free.  
I surrender
