Could it be that he's interested  
Or am I just wanting it be so  
Do I dare speak to him  
Or should I let the moment go  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feelin' flow  
Should I just let it flow  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe ?.  
Oh and baby, I sure would like to know  
  
Could it be he's just friendly  
And that's nothing to get excited about  
On the other hand he could be answering  
The good vibrations I'm sendin' out  
Well I just don't know  
What I really see in  
Should I make a move  
Or keep on daydreamin'  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe  
Oh and maybe baby, I sure would like to know  
  
Wanna know ?wanna know ?  
  
Could it be that he's interested  
Or should I let the moment go and  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feelin' flow  
Should I just let it flow  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe ?.  
Oh and baby, I sure would like to know  
  
Repeat  
  
Forget this hunger inside  
Forget this hunger inside  
Should I let the feelin' flow  
Should I just let it flow  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe  
Ain't nothin' but a maybe
