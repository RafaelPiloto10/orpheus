That girl, she's a party, all nighter  
Little 'Funky Cold Medina  
Little 'Strawberry Winer  
That girl, she's a love gone stringer  
Me a year old bum country singer  
That girl, she's the walk on the wild side  
She's the day glory snow ride  
Low ride, good time  
  
If you see her tell her I'm lookin' for  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find, I'll be spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Sun down, heaven town  
Drivin' 'round, hittin' the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
That girl she's a sugar-sweet drive by  
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans oh my  
Yellow hammer south Georgia  
Mississippi chick  
Drink cherry wine  
Louisiana lipstick  
  
That girl likes to drink it up real loud  
Blowing smoke in a back broke rebel cloud  
Drop it down summer heat  
I gotta seat up high, silver rebel seat  
  
Waiting for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find  
Got me spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Somewhere in heaven's town  
Driving wild, hitting the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl  
  
Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song  
Baby, where you've been?  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Looking for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find  
Got me spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Somewhere in heaven's town  
Driving wild, hitting the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
Yeah, maybe you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
I've been waiting for that girl  
  
Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song  
Baby, climb on in
