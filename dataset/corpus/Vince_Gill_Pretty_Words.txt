I've seen the way he cast his spell  
He's gonna hurt you I can tell  
Just to prove that he can be your lover  
He's gonna turn on that charm  
Tonight he'll wrap you in his arms  
Tomrrow he will leave you for another  
  
Pretty is as pretty does  
That's how it is and always was  
Pretty words are all he's givin' you  
And when he whispers int he dark  
Watch out he's gonna break your heart  
'Cause pretty words won't make your dreams come true  
They're just pretty words  
Just pretty words  
  
In the morning you will find  
That you were just the next in line  
there's nothing I can do that's gonna stop you  
Before you go just let me say  
I'd never treat your love that way  
I'll be here long after he's forgot you  
  
Pretty is as pretty does  
That's how it is and always was  
Pretty words are all he's givin' you  
And when he whispers int he dark  
Watch out he's gonna break your heart  
'Cause pretty words won't make your dreams come true  
They're just pretty words  
Just pretty words
