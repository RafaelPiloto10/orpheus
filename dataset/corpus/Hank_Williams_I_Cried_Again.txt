This song is hard to pick out on the copy I have. It is pretty scratchy  
And a couple of the words I have for lyrics in here may be wrong but I  
Think they are right. Email greg if you see a problem with it.  
  
I cried again key: g  
  
(g)teardrops (c)fell the night you (g)said  
I love you dear but you are (d)wed  
I (g)watched you (c)as you held his (g)hand  
Then I turned (d)away and cried again  
  
[Chorus:]  
I (c) cried again when I reached (g)home  
There sat your picture all a(d)lone  
I (g)thought of (c)things that might have (g)been  
I bowed my (d)head and cried a(g)gain  
  
I took your letters from the shelf  
Then read aloud just to myself  
But just before I reached the end  
I bowed my head and cried again  
  
Chorus  
  
And heres the reason why I say  
Dear, I must throw your things away  
For they would only bring me pain  
And I'd bow my head and cry again  
  
Chorus
