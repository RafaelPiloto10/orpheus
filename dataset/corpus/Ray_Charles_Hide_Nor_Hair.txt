Hide nor hair  
Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever  
And I was burning up inside  
My baby walked in my bedroom  
And I could hardly open my eyes  
She said she was going to the pawn shop  
Just across the track  
She started packing some clothes in a hurry  
And then she said she would be right back  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
I remember so well when she slammed the door  
But the girl didn't make it back no more  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I waited for her twenty four hours  
And I was just about to starve to death  
It didn't look like she was coming back  
So I had to look out for myself  
Well I called the police department  
To find out what they knew  
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet  
Because they were looking for her too.  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
Well I don't know what happened across the track  
But I know my baby didn't make it back  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.  
Well I called my Dr. Foster  
And when the girl answered the phone  
I got a funny feeling  
The way she said Dr. Foster had gone  
She said he left with a lady patient  
About twenty four hours ago  
I added two and two and here's what I got  
I got I'll never see that girl no mo'  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
If Dr. foster has got her then I know I'm through  
Cause he's got medicine and money too.  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.  
Whoa no
