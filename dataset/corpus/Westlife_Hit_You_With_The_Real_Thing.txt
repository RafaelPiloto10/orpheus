It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up  
I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate  
I've almost got you there so let me take you all the way  
a taste is stimulating keep you hot like  
  
[Chorus]  
What (take it till you're high and low)  
Like how (system overload)  
Like who (sure your wanna rock the boat)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What (rock you from the left to right)  
Like how (electro paradise)  
Like who (if you wanna up your line)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
Taste the infinity and mysteries surrounding you  
Erotic stereo it's in the bass and trebble too  
Come hold your hands above your head and let them  
levitate  
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop  
  
[Chorus]  
Like what (take it till you're high and low)  
Like how (system overload)  
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What (rock you from the left to right)  
Like how (electro paradise)  
Like who (if you wanna up your line)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
need you more than enough  
ecstasy till your insane  
find adrenaline rush  
feel the power through your vains  
and hit you with the real thing  
  
(bring it till you're high and low)  
(system overload)  
  
I'm gonna show you how I'm rocking the boat  
(rock you from the left to right)  
(electro paradise)  
I'm gonna hit you with the real thing  
  
It's 99 degrees and the temperature is creeping up  
I felt your foundation via great amount in moderate  
Come hold your hands above your head and let them  
levitate  
And be hypnotic and the trip won't stop  
  
Like what (take it till you're high and low)  
Like how (system overload)  
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What (rock you from the left to right)  
Like how (electro paradise)  
Like who (if you wanna up your line)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
Like what (take it till you're high and low)  
Like how (system overload)  
Like who (sure you wanna rock the boat)  
And hit you with the real thing  
  
What (rock you from the left to right)  
Like how (electro paradise)  
Like who (if you wanna up your line)  
And hit you with the real thing
