Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now  
Something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me now  
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol can thrill me now  
It's getting late in the game to show any pride or shame  
I just burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now  
  
Doctor says my liver looks like leaving with my lover, need another time-out
now  
Like any sort of hero turning down to zero still standing out in any crowd  
  
Pulling seventeen with experience and dreams, sweating out a happy hour  
Where you're hiding 29 you know it ain't a crime  
To burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now  
  
Dr. Finlay: "And my advice is if you maintain this lifestyle  
you won't reach 30"  
  
Torch: "Christ - it's a romantic way to go really, it's part  
of the heritage, it's your round i'n'it?"  
  
We burn a little brighter now  
  
Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now  
It was something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me
now  
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol thrill me now  
Getting late in the game to show any pride or shame  
Burn a little brighter now, we burn a little brighter now  
We burn a little brighter now
