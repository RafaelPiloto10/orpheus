Lately I've been going through some things  
That's really got me down  
I need someone, somebody to help me come and  
Turn my life around  
  
I can't explain it  
I can't obtain it  
Jesus Your love is so,  
It's so amazing  
  
It gets me high, up to the sky and when  
I think about Your goodness it makes me want to  
Stomp  
Makes me clap my hands  
  
Makes me want to dance and Stomp  
My brother can't you see I've got the victory  
Stomp!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Stomp on the enemy 'cause I've got the victory  
  
Stomp on the enemy 'cause I've got the victory
