I'm giving love for Christmas  
To everyone I know  
It doesn't need a bow  
It only needs to come from your heart  
  
I'm giving love for Christmas  
So everyone can see  
What Christmas means to me  
It's more than presents under the tree  
  
Christmas is all about caring  
And as every princess knows  
Nothing is quiet as warming  
When it's storming or it snows  
  
So, I'm giving love for Christmas  
The best gift that I can give  
And in these times we live  
It seems more and more, what we're looking for  
  
Christmas is being with family  
Seeing all the friends you've missed  
Making new Christmas memories  
That's the first thing on my Christmas list  
  
I'd give you everything  
If I had everything, it's true  
But all that I have is my heart to give  
So that's what I'm giving you  
  
I'm giving love for Christmas  
And hoping that you will too  
(I will, I will)  
  
And hoping that if you do  
It just might be me, you give your love to  
And that would be  
My best Christmas dream come true
