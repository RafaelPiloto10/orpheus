I walk alone into lady night  
She wraps me in her black veils, wraps me tight  
Her velvet touch on my weary eyes  
Kisses softly  
Windy sighs  
  
Lady night in her grandeur flaunts jewels of light  
Flirting with sir half-moon,  
She shimmies slowly backs-o-mountains  
Dips her hair in twilight  
  
Walk alone into lady night  
The woman' s discreet as a grave, and I know she' ll  
Want your tears  
Lady night' s got an appetite  
For sorrow liquidated into pearls of light  
One by one shell gather them to her breast  
Kiss your lowered eyes and bid you rest.  
  
She takes me to her tummy, I clutch her warmth  
I know that I am falling  
She delves into my mind, brings out my darkest thoughts  
To keep her dark from dawning  
(I know that' s what she wants)  
  
I turn my back to lady night  
My mind is clear  
My pearls are in her satchel  
I' ve paid my share of blackness to her.  
  
Turn my back to the lady, though she calls  
She calls...  
But I am going to the dawn  
And she can no longer  
Keep me...
