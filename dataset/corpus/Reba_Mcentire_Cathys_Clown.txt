[Chorus]  
I want your loving more and more  
I want your kisses that's for sure  
I die each time  
I hear the sound  
They're saying here he comes  
He's Cathy's Clown  
  
You know you've got to stand tall  
You know a man can't crawl  
And when you let her tell you lies  
And you let em pass you by  
You're not a man at all  
  
She don't want your loving anymore  
She don't want your kisses that's for sure  
Why do you let them put you down  
And let em call you Cathy's Clown  
  
When you see me shed a tear  
Then you know that I'm sincere  
I just think it's kinda sad  
That she's treating you so bad  
And I'm the one who cares  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're Cathy's Clown  
You're Cathy's Clown
