I want to shake  
I want to wind out  
I want to leave  
(this) mind and shout  
  
I've lived  
all this life  
like an ocean  
in disguise  
I don't live for  
ever  
you can't keep me here  
  
I want to race  
with the sundwon  
I want a last breath  
I don't let out  
  
Forgive  
every being  
the bad feelings  
it's just me  
I won't wait  
for answers  
you can't keep  
me here  
  
I want to rise  
and say goodnight  
want to take  
a look on the other side  
  
I've lived  
all these lives  
it's been wonder  
full at night  
I will live for  
ever  
you can't keep  
me here.
