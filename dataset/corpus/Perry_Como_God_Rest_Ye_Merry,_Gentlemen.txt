God rest ye merry, gentlemen,  
Let nothing you dismay,  
Remember Christ our Savior,  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
To save us all from Satan's power,  
When we were gone astray,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy,  
Comfort and joy,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father,  
A blessed Angel came,  
And unto certain Shepherds,  
Brought tidings of the same  
  
How, that in Bethlehem was born,  
The Son of God by name,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy,  
Comfort and joy,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy,  
Comfort and joy,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
The Shepherds at these tidings,  
Rejoiced much in mind,  
And left their flocks a feeding,  
In tempest storm and wind,  
And went to Bethlehem straight way,  
The blessed babe to find,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy,  
Comfort and joy,  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
