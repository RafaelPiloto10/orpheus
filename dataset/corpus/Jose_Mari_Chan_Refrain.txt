I look out and  
I see the rain  
As it falls on  
My window pane  
And the music  
That's in my heart  
Is a  
Sad refrain  
  
Endless traffic of  
Sounds and sights  
Midst the glitter  
Of neon lights  
Still the music  
That's in my heart  
Is the same  
Sad refrain  
  
Mem'ries of you follow  
Everywhere I go  
Down the high and  
Bi-ways of my days  
Music of your laughter  
Fills my every dream  
Like a love song  
From long ago  
Never ending streams  
Of faces come and go  
Million diff'rent  
People all around  
No use searching for  
I'll never find you  
There for you are  
Far beyond compare  
  
Take a jet  
To a hide-away  
From the hum-drum  
Of everyday  
Still the music  
That's in my heart  
Is a  
Sad refrain  
  
Fluctuations in  
The market scene  
Fill my Dow-Jones  
With every beam  
And the music  
That's in my heart  
Is the same  
Sad refrain  
  
Mem'ries of you follow  
Everywhere I go  
Down the high and  
Bi-ways of my days  
Music of your laughter  
Fills my every dream  
Like a love song  
From long ago  
Never ending streams  
Of faces come and go  
Million diff'rent  
People all around  
No use searching for  
I'll never find you  
There for you are  
Far beyond compare  
  
La ra ra ra ra  
Ra ra ra ra  
No use searching  
For I'll never  
No use searching for  
I'll never find you  
There for you are  
Far beyond compare
