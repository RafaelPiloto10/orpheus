The nights are so lonely and the days pass me by  
True love has faded, left me behind  
So we'll just move along and stop wasting time  
It's over all over now  
  
It's over, end of the line  
It's over and your doin' fine  
It's over and over and over, I'm asking why  
You're leaving it's over now  
  
Gone are the love songs that only we knew  
Robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through  
Gone is the sweet love, tried but untrue  
It's over all over now  
  
It's over, end of the line  
It's over and my desperate heart is still trying to find some way,  
Hoping you'll stay  
Cause it's over, all over now  
It's over, all over now
