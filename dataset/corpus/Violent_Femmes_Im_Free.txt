I'm free and I'm happy  
I am free from your hatred  
I've parted from the part  
That I participated in  
So I'm free it was easy  
  
I know nothing of your hatred  
I've known and shone the light  
And the darkness abated  
So I'm free  
  
Run, skip, jump, play  
My little boy is happy  
Look he's smiling because  
He knows no fear here  
  
My mommy's calling me  
And I'm running through the fields  
Because I'm free  
Every day in every way  
  
I'm getting better and better and better  
And better and better and better, etc.  
Because there's no fear, here why  
  
I can't tell you now 'cause  
I'm running through the woods  
And I just jumped a little bit higher  
Cause I'm free  
And that's the way he created me to be  
  
I have turned from your hatred  
I turned on the light  
And there was nothing there that waited to get me  
This ain't a song about that  
This is a song about this
