All I want  
Is all you got  
Make me happy baby  
And I'll make it hot  
  
I don't need no doctor  
To tell me what to do  
'Cause I know I'm goin'  
Straight ahead for you  
  
I got that tunnel vision goin' through my head  
I can't help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
  
All that's yours  
And all that's mine  
We'll put together baby  
And we can combine  
  
We don't need no lawyer  
Let's not make this long  
We just need a love thing  
That's beautiful and strong  
  
I got that tunnel vision  
Goin' through my head  
I can't help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
I can't help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
Come on here ... yeah !  
  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
I can't help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
I can't help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin' through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed
