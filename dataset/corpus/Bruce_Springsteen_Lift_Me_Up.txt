I don't need your answered prayers  
Or the chains your lover wears  
I don't need your rings of gold  
Or the secrets that you hold  
Lift me up,  
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up  
Let your love lift me up  
  
I don't need your sacred vow  
Or the promise tomorrow brings  
Veiled behind the morning clouds  
I'll take the fate the daylight brings  
Lift me up, darling  
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up  
Let your love lift me up  
  
When the morning bright  
Lifts away this night  
In the light above  
We will find our love, we will find our love  
  
Your skin, your hand upon my neck  
This skin, your fingers on my skin  
This kiss, this heartbeat, this breath  
This heart, this heart, this wilderness  
Lift me up, darling  
Lift me up and I'll fall with your lift me up  
Let your love lift me up
