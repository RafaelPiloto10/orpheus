Some spend their time in conversation  
They just talk and talk all day  
But there's a sweeter situation, and  
It's just a touch away  
One kiss can say all that we need to say  
Don't have to tell me you care  
The message gets through  
With the things you're doing  
When we're alone in the dark, you speak  
To my soul, talk to my heart  
In the language of love, we say everything  
Every time that we touch we say so much  
In the language of love, nothing says it better  
Than when we're talking together  
Touch by touch in the language of love  
In the language of love  
This love don't need no explanation  
We understand just fine, oh baby  
Got heart to heart communication  
I tell ya that's the sweetest kind  
I love the way your body talks to mine  
You can just look in my eyes to know that it's  
Real 'cause we go by feeling  
We don't need words to express what's in our hearts we say it best
