Inhale the joy  
Inhale the fun  
Now it's time for me to get on top  
Of the world  
  
Inhale the music and the warmth  
The crowd is ready to bring me to the top  
Of the world  
  
'Cause the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
Cause the world is mine  
And I'm feeling so divine  
  
I'm part of this illusive show  
Time for me to get on stage  
Lights fade  
  
Tomorrow you'll be at my feet  
Saturated senses set me free  
It's all I need  
  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
I won't stop this time  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
And I'm feeling so divine  
  
Because the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
The world, the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
Oh no  
Oh no  
  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
I won't stop this time  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
And I'm feeling so divine  
  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
I won't stop this time  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
And I'm feeling so divine  
  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
I won't stop this time  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
And I'm feeling so divine  
  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
I won't stop this time  
I won't stop this time  
'Cause the world is mine  
The world, the world is mine  
And I'm feeling so divine
