Nowhere to run I know  
She's got the best of me  
The deed is done, Heaven knows  
She wants the rest of me  
  
It's much too late  
I'm caught up in the fantasy  
There's no escape  
My runnin' days are history  
  
Gina, Gina, girl I surrender  
Gina, Gina, I'm over my head  
Never been in love this way  
Never been in love this way  
  
Been on the loose so long  
Love couldn't hold me down  
The flame in you was so strong  
Girl you turned my heart around  
  
Now I'm losin' sleep  
Can't get you out of my head  
Think I'm in too deep  
I'm a slave to every word that you said  
  
Gina, Gina, girl I surrender  
Gina, Gina, I'm over my head  
Gina, Gina, it's forever  
Never been in love this way  
Never been in love this way
