In a while, in a word,  
Every moment now returns.  
For a while, seen or heard,  
How each memory softly burns.  
Facing you who brings me new tomorrows,  
I thank God for yesterdays,  
How they led me to this very hour,  
How they led me to this place...  
Every touch, every smile,  
You have given me in care.  
Keep in heart, always I'll,  
Now be treasuring everywhere.  
And if life should come to just one question,  
Do I hold this moment true?  
No trace of sadness,  
Always with gladness...  
'I DO...'  
(instrumental)  
Now a song that speaks of now and ever,  
Beckons me to someone new,  
Unexpected, unexplored, unseen,  
Filled with promise coming through.  
In a while, in a word,  
You and I forever change,  
Love so clear, never blurred,  
Has me feeling wondrous, strange,  
And if life should come to just one question,  
Do I face each moment true?  
No trace of sadness, always with gladness,  
'I DO...'  
Never with sadness...  
Always with gladness...  
'I...DO....'
