I need to know if you were real  
'Cause I've been known to get it wrong  
When the memory comes  
I'll say I'm always in the dark  
You got me now  
  
Chorus  
I want to give you back  
I want to give you back  
Somewhere out of here  
I want to give you  
I want to give you  
I want to give you back  
  
I can't remember how it went  
You looked like everything I wanted  
And as you came along  
Slowly everything began to change  
I got you now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's enough  
Just talking about it  
I don't mind  
I don't mind no I  
Laugh enough  
Just dreaming about it  
  
I need to know if you were real  
I'd hate to think that I'd been fooled again  
And as the vision fades  
I'll say I was blinded by your eyes  
I felt them burn  
  
[Chorus]
