Hot sun, dancin' on the river  
We'd sit on the bank and watch the world roll by  
Our feet in the water, she'd press her lips to mine  
We were so long on love but short on time  
She could be honeymoon sweet and a little wild  
And she was mine for a little while  
  
I laugh every time when I think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
She's gone but she left me with a smile  
Cause she was mine for a little while  
  
We'd take a drive and park down next to airport road  
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town  
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down  
But I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow  
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when  
It matters, but didn't back then  
  
I laugh when I start to think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
She's gone but she left me with a smile  
?Cause she was mine for a little while  
  
I keep seeing pictures now of me and her  
And those summer nights  
My minds filled with her, oh and it's alright  
  
I laugh when I start to think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
She's gone but she left me with a smile  
?Cause she was mine for a little while
