Everyday  
I'm on my knees to pray  
Since I kissed you once  
And I held you once  
Things have never been the same  
  
And I've tried  
God knows I've tried  
But there's nothing left  
In the world today  
That's making sense in any way  
  
Even now, I'm in love with you  
No matter what you put me through  
There'll always be someone like you  
Who lets me down again  
  
But every time  
I've tried to make you mine  
It seems there's nothing else  
I will ever find  
That will make you stay  
Make you change your mind  
Sad to say  
It's the same thing everyday  
But there's no one else  
In the world today  
That will make it change  
Take the pain away  
  
Even now, I'm in love with you  
No matter what you put me through  
There'll always be someone like you  
Who lets me down again  
  
And everyday no matter what I do  
I'm more and more in love with you  
I can't believe it's really true  
You wouldn't really go
