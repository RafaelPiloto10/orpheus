There have been hard times all around me  
I just can't seem to see the light of day.  
I need one chance to get away  
Before the darkness falls upon me.  
  
I need someone to comfort me  
When I can't deal with the pain  
Somebody to stand by me.  
  
I need one woman  
With the same soul as my own.  
I need one woman  
We can find our way back home.  
  
If I lose my mind, who will find it?  
If I draw a line, I'm gonna cross it today.  
There must be one place my spirit's free  
If my soul could only find it.  
  
I'm alone in a cold dark place  
But there's light on the other side.  
Just wait 'till I get my self free, I'll find me  
  
One woman  
With the same soul as my own.  
I need one woman.  
No I can't do this alone.  
  
I need one woman  
With the same soul as my own.  
Give me one woman  
We can find our way back home.  
  
Turn around  
Take a step and turn around.  
Turn around  
Move ahead and turn around.  
  
It's never too late to turn around.  
Don't want to wait no longer for
