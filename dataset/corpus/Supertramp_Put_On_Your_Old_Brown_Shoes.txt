Put on your old brown shoes  
Right on your feet  
Time to move on, get away  
You know you did your dues  
Did all you could  
Time to move on, no more to say  
  
You and me, we're helpless can't you see  
We've got to get away, get away  
Got to move on  
Till the madness around is gone  
And the rest of our lives we'll be free  
  
Kick out the morning blues  
Who needs a job  
Who needs pain and oppression  
You know it can't be beat  
Stand on your own two feet  
Goodbye rain and depression  
  
You and me, helpless can't you see  
We've got to get away, get away  
Got to move on, catch the next train  
And we'll be gone  
And the rest of our lives we'll be free  
  
Get your blue jeans right on, babe  
Get your blue jeans right on, babe  
  
You know a friend is a friend  
You don't leave him in trouble  
He got a little drunk, so now he's seeing double  
Don't you see him there yeah lying in the rubble  
But you have to lend a hand  
Cause you know he's on the level  
  
You and me, we're helpless can't you see  
We've got to get away, get away  
Got to move on, catch the next train  
And we'll be gone  
And the rest of our lives we'll be free
