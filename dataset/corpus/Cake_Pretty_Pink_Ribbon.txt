Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd float down to the sea  
  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd say just what you please  
Without the sticky little kitten  
Your ticket could never be free  
  
Without the tight little denim  
Your virtues would all go unknown  
Without the room that you live in  
Your cancer would eat to the bone  
  
Your muscles would bulge underground  
Your demons would all be around  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me  
  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd burn all these dying leaves  
  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd lift this steaming herd  
You would kill all the sick ones  
You would bury them deep in the earth  
  
Without the tight little denim  
Your virtues would all go unknown  
Without the room that you live in  
Your cancers would eat to the bone  
  
Your muscles would bulge underground  
Your demons would all be around  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me
