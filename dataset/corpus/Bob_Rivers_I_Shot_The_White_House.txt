I Shot The White House  
(I Shot The Sherrif - Eric Clapton)  
  
I shot the White House  
But I did not hit the President  
I shot the White House  
But I did not hit the President  
  
Firing rounds at the compound  
'til a tourist dragged me down  
Bill Clinton was a-watching his tv  
When I strolled right past security  
So I shot, I shot his house  
I swear  
  
I shot the White House  
But I never got inside the fence, oh no no  
I shot the White House  
Guess I must have been a little tense  
  
(Attention! You, with the automatic weapon...  
Uhh... I'm not sure but I don't think you're  
Supposed to have that.)  
(Will agent Moe and agent Larry please proceed  
Immediately to the emergency area)  
(Soi-tainly.)(Ehhh... Grab that gun, numbskull)  
(whoo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)
