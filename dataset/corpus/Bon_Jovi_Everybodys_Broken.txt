Welcome to the party  
Come on in and disappear  
You're feeling like a stranger  
But all your friends are here  
Little lines and cracks  
Around your eyes and mouth  
Something's trying to get in  
Something's trying to get out  
  
It's OK, to be a little broken  
Everybody's broken, in this life  
It's OK, to feel a little broken  
Everybody's broken, you're alright  
It's just life  
  
Step into the deep end  
Make yourself at home  
When you wonder why your breathing  
Know you're not alone  
It's so hard to believe  
It's easier to doubt  
You're trying to hold in  
But you're dying to scream out  
  
It's OK to be a little broken  
Everybody's broken  
In this life  
It's OK to feel a little broken  
Everybody's broken, you're alright  
It's alright, it's just life  
  
Take a look around  
Tell me what you see  
Is who you think you are  
Who you want to be  
  
It's OK, to be a little broken  
Everybody's broken, in this life  
It's OK, to feel a little broken  
Everybody's broken, you're alright  
Just keep on going  
Eyes wide open  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Everybody's broken  
Yeah
