I can tell by the look that's in your eyes  
And I'm not surprised  
You got to move on like the sun got to rise  
I'm just holdin' you down  
  
Bridge:  
But the universe is calling you  
You are one of chosen fews  
You got to pay your dues  
  
Me and the baby gonna miss you  
I see your smile in her face  
I only wish we were with you now  
It's a lonely, lonely place  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus:  
Hey, pack'd my bags, put 'em at the door  
Hey, pack'd my bags, put 'em at the door  
Hey, pack'd my bags, put 'em at the door  
  
I know you'll make it  
You deserve it, you know you do  
The blues, you'll shake it  
I'll, I'll focus our view  
  
Oh, don't let them change you  
Come like thieves in the night  
Oh, don't' let them rearrage you, boy  
You've got to do what's right  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Once a month, each time you say  
Goin' away, oh  
I don't wanna see you go  
No no no no no no no no no no  
  
Oh you, you've got to make it  
You've got to make it, boy  
Go on now
