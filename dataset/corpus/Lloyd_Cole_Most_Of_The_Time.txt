Most of the time  
I'm too focused all around  
Most of the time  
I can keep both feet on the ground  
I can follow the path  
I can read the sign  
I can stay right with it  
As the road unwinds  
I can handle whatever  
I stumble upon  
I don't even notice that she's gone  
Most of the time  
Most of the time  
It's well understood  
Most of the time  
I wouldn't change it if I could  
I could make it all match up  
I can hold my own?  
I could deal with the situation  
Right down to the bone  
I could survive  
I can endure  
And I don't even think  
'bout her  
Most of the time  
Most of the time  
My head is on straight  
Most of the time  
I'm strong enough not to hate  
I don't build up illusion until it makes me sick  
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick  
I can smile in the face of mankind  
I don't even remember how her lips felt on mine  
Most of the time  
Most of the time  
She ain't even in my mind  
Would I know her if I saw her  
She's that far behind  
Most of the time I can't even be sure  
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her  
Most of the time I'm halfways content  
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went  
I would cheat on myself  
I don't run and hide  
I won't hide from the feelings  
That I buried inside  
I don't compromise  
And I don't pretend  
And I don't even care  
If I ever see her again  
Most of the time
