Climb up here beside me  
We can ride and find a friend unfound  
Put your foot upon the laughing gas  
And drive your grin around  
Omnibus, take all of us  
All of us, take Omnibus  
Ain't nothing in the world like a white skinned girl  
Make your Union Jack and make your flag unfurl  
You can't say you've ridden  
'Till you've given up your heart and seat  
Man that lady clippie rip your ticket  
Make your trip complete  
Omnibus, take all of us  
All of us, take Omnibus  
Ain't nothing in the world like a black skinned girl  
Make your shakespeare hard and make your oyster pearl  
Don't let horses pass you by  
Take a run and leap on  
Pull the blinkers from your eyes  
Before big bus has gone  
We'll be stopping off  
In every shop until you find that mate  
Don't waste time, go on and taste them all  
Why don't you fill your plate?  
Omnibus, take all of us  
All of us, take Omnibus  
There's nothing in the world like a gold skinned girl  
To make your bonsai weep and make your bamboo curl  
Omnibus, take all of us  
All of us, take Omnibus  
Omnibus, take all of us  
All of us, take Omnibus  
Ain't nothing in the world like a green skinned girl  
But that don't mean to say you can't look
