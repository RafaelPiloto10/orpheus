Big orange ball, sinkin' in the water  
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter  
Little umbrella shaped margaritas  
Coconut oil, tan senioritas  
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels  
  
Hands on the wheel, cruisin' down the interstate  
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away  
I was going fast as a Rambler goes  
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes  
Now I know how Richard Petty feels  
  
I've been around the block a time or two  
Done almost everything a boy can do  
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun  
But there is one thing that I haven't done  
  
Saved two months, bought a little diamond  
Tonight's the night, feels like perfect timin'  
Down on one knee on momma's front steps,  
Man I'm gonna die if she really says yes  
  
I want to know how forever feels  
  
I've been around the block a time or two  
Done almost everything a boy can do  
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun  
But there is one thing that I haven't done  
  
I want to know how forever feels  
Hey, I want to know how forever feels  
Girl, I want to know how forever feels
