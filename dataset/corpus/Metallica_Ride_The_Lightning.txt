Guilty as charged  
But dammit, it ain't right  
Someone else controlling me  
  
Death in the air  
Strapped in the electric chair  
This can't be happening to me  
  
Who made you God to say  
"I'll take your life from you!"  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Wait for the sign  
To flick the switch of death  
It's the beginning of the end  
  
Sweat, chilling cold  
As I watch death unfold  
Consciousness my only friend  
  
My fingers grip with fear  
What I am doing here?  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Someone help me  
Oh please God help me  
They're trying to take it all away  
I don't want to die  
  
Time moving slow  
The minutes seem like hours  
The final curtain call I see  
  
How true is this?  
Just get it over with  
If this is true, just let it be  
  
Wakened by horrid screams  
Freed from this frightening dream  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain
