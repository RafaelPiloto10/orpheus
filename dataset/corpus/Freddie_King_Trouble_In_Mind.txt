The sun gonna shine  
In my back door someday  
  
Trouble in mind, I'm blue  
But I won't be blue always  
You know the sun gonna shine  
In my back door someday  
  
I'm gonna lay my head  
On some lonesome railroad line  
And let a 2: 19 train ease my worried mind  
  
I'm gonna lay my head  
On some lonesome railroad line  
And let a 2: 19 train ease my worried mind  
  
Trouble in mind, I'm blue  
But I won't, I won't be blue always  
You know the sun gonna shine  
In my back door someday, yeah
