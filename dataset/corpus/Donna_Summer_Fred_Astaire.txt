Romance me...dance me  
'til I don't care  
You haven't lived until you've danced on air  
Whisper nothings if you dare  
Won't you please, be my Fred Astaire  
  
(Jam):  
Everybody up...everybody up  
Everybody up on the dance floor now  
Everybody up...everybody up  
Everybody up on the dance floor now  
  
I know they call you Mr. Lonely Heart  
But you're the leading man to play the part  
You don't have to be a millionaire  
All you have to do is be my Fred Astaire  
  
(Chorus):  
Get up now...get up now  
Get up now...be my Fred Astaire (x2)  
  
(Jam):  
When you move it's like a melody  
Serenading...the very heart of me  
I'll be your Ginger Rogers on the floor  
Swirl me. twirl me 'til I just can't  
Take no more  
  
(Chorus):  
Boy if you could only read my mind  
You've been in my dreams a thousand time  
  
(Jam):  
(Chorus Jam):  
Everybody up  
(get up now)  
Everybody up  
(get up now)  
Everybody up  
(be my Fred Astaire).
