Here I sit all alone, thinkin' 'bout what I should have known  
You made me think that I could need you  
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you  
Lookin back on you and me, promises that will never be  
I truly thought we were lovers  
But now I find that I'm just like all the others  
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind  
Sweet little love maker, takin my heart and leave me behind  
Heartbreaker couldn't you be  
Just a little more kind to me  
Played with fire, felt its burn  
I would have thought that I would have learned  
I melted every time you kissed me  
Every time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me  
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind  
Sweet little love maker, takin' my heart and leave me behind  
Heartbreaker couldn't you be  
Just a little more kind to me
