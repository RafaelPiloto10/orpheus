Last time I saw him  
He sweetly kissed my lips  
Last time I saw him  
He said "I'll be back for more of this"  
Last time I saw him  
We were crying at the bus  
I knew he hated leaving  
But he had to set us up  
  
I gave him money  
I know I invested well  
Mamma doesn't trust him  
But he loves me I can tell  
  
Each time the greyhound  
Arrives at nine o' clock  
But I don't start my crying  
'Till that last man's gotten off  
  
Last time I saw him  
Last time I saw my honey  
Last time I saw him  
He was Greyhound-bound  
But I'm still waiting here  
Without a fear  
That bus will someday turn around  
  
I had no letter  
It's been six months, maybe better  
I try forgetting him  
But I love him more then ever  
  
I have decided  
I've waited long enough  
If there was nothing wrong  
He would return right on that bus  
  
There must be trouble  
So I'm leavin' on the double  
If he can't get to me  
I know he needs me desperately  
  
Last time I saw him  
Last time I saw my honey  
Last time I saw him  
He was looking fine  
And as he waved goodbye  
He said don't cry  
I'm coming back, no rain or shine  
  
Last time I saw him  
Last time I saw my honey  
Last time I saw him  
He was greyhound-bound  
And as he waved goodbye  
He said don't cry  
I'm coming back, no rain or shine  
  
La de da, la da do  
Do la da da, da da da  
  
Last time I saw him  
He was looking fine  
And as he waved goodbye  
He said don't cry  
I'm coming back, no rain or shine
