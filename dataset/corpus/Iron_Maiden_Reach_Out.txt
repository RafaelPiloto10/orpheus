It's over your head  
And you don't seem to understand  
One word I say  
And you can't live your life  
Trying to run away  
  
You're fighting your friends  
You're wearing everybody out  
But it never ends  
You're wearing me out  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on  
Reach out  
And let somebody in your life  
  
Don't get me wrong  
You always apologize  
It's just your way  
Of making a scene  
You need to be loved  
It's not such a crime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Over your head  
You just don't seem to understand  
One word I say  
And you can't live your life  
You got so much love  
It's burning inside  
  
[Chorus]
