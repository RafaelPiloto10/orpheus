Please pardon me, but I'm longing to speak  
I hope you don't mind my staring  
I don't mind, cause your face looks so kind  
Seldom you'll find someone so daring  
  
You remind me of a friend of mine  
Ooh, I've lost (the) time, yeah  
  
Everytime I see your face  
You remind me of that someone  
In fact, it's true, it's you  
Runnin' right into you  
  
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine  
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind  
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine  
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind  
  
Please pardon me, but I'm longing to speak  
I hope you don't mind my starin'  
I don't mind, cause your face looks so kind  
Seldom you'll find someone so daring  
  
Everytime I see your face  
You remind me of that someone  
In fact, it was you  
Runnin' right into you
