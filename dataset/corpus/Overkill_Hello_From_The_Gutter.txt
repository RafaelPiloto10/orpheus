All those dreams and broken glass.  
Swept down the sewer with the rest of the trash.  
Never to be seen again.  
Now you're makin' a home in a garbage can!!!  
  
But here's a little story that I lived to tell.  
Hello from the gutter!  
Hello from our little hell!  
  
Wasted days, wasted nights.  
Hypnotized by the city lights!  
Another king, another queen.  
Livin' in the shadows so they can't be seen!  
Remember all the world lies at your feet.  
And the big apple's rotten,  
Rotten in the heat.  
  
Hello! Hello!  
Hello from the gutter.  
Hello! Hello!  
  
Hello from the gutter!!!  
Hello! Hello!  
Hello from the gutter.  
Hello! Hello!  
Hello from the gutter!!  
  
Gutter child, sweet sixteen.  
Broadway stars that have never been!!!  
All those dreams and broken glass,  
Swept down the sewer with the rest of the trash.  
  
Well here's a little story that we lived to tell.  
Hello from the gutter!  
Hello from our little hell!  
  
Hello from the gutter.  
Hello from the gutter. Hey!  
  
Welcome the the gutter!  
We've been expecting you!
