What in this world, feels so alive  
Makes us, then breaks us, then helps us survive  
Buries our hopes, then revives our desire to succeed  
We're all greed  
Who in this world sees when I cry  
Throws me, then shows me that I'm justified  
Measure my worth, then decide that I'm not what they need  
They've agreed  
Where in this world can I hide?  
Where can I find someone  
That sees me inside to confide  
How in this world can I go on  
Wondering if you'll think of me when I'm gone?  
Shielding my eyes from the pitiless light of the glare  
Should you care?  
When in this world is it enough?  
I never thought it could be quite this rough  
Living my life as if millions of people don't stare  
They're not there  
Why should I have to defend or derive  
Most of the rules of the game, I've defied  
Though it's been hard on my pride  
It's been one hell of a ride  
Curiously  
I didn't set out to be famous
