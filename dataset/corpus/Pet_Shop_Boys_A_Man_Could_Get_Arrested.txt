Late on Tuesday evening, such a commotion in the street  
Someone broke a window, and someone's head got beat  
A wave of breaking bottles, crashed across the city street  
And someone got arrested, for the breach of the peace

You've got your health, you've got everything, that's what my doctor said  
You may not have much cash, but you've got a roof over your head  
Of course I said I loved you, not just 'cause you insisted
