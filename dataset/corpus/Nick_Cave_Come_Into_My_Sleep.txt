Now that mountains of meaningless words  
And oceans divide us  
And we each have our own set of stars  
To comfort and guide us  
Come into my sleep  
Come into my sleep, oh yeah  
Dry your eyes and do not weep  
Come into my sleep  
  
Swim to me through the deep blue sea  
Upon the scattered stars set sail  
Fly to me through this love-lit night  
From one thousand miles away  
And come into my sleep  
Come into my sleep oh yeah  
As midnight nears and shadows creep  
Come into my sleep  
  
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair  
For I am sick at heart, my dear  
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair  
For all the sorrow it will pass, my dear  
  
Take your accusation, your recriminations  
And toss them into the ocean blue  
Leave your regrets and impossible longings  
And scatter them across the sky behind you  
And come into my sleep  
Come into my sleep  
For my soul to comfort and keep  
Come into my sleep  
  
For my soul to comfort and keep - my sleep  
  
Come on,  
Come on,  
Come on,  
[repeat and fade]
