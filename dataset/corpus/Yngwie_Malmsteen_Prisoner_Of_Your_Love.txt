My heart  
fell into the palms of your hands  
this love  
made me understand  
I've waited all my life for you  
thought i'd live and die alone  
enraptured by the beauty  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
I'm wrapped around your finger  
like the ring on your hand  
I'm trapped  
by your love i'm yours, please understand  
I've waited all my life for you  
thought i'd live and die alone  
enraptured by the beauty  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
enraptured by the beauty  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
enraptured by the beauty  
I'm a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
I'm a prisoner of your love.
