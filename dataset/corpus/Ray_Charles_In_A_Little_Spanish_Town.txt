Evenings are crowded with memories  
Thrilling me again  
Like that night in spain  
Someone is sharing my memories  
Wonder does she grieve  
Every lovely evening  
  
In a little Spanish town  
'Twas on a night like this  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
'Twas on a night like this  
I whispered "Be true to me"  
And she sighed: "Si, Si"  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons had passed away  
And still she's in my heart  
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
'Twas on a night like this  
  
Somehow I keep on remembering  
Tears that said goodbye  
Shining in her eye  
Wonder does she keep remembering  
Promises of mine  
When the moon is shining  
  
In a little Spanish town  
'Twas on a night like this  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
'Twas on a night like this  
I whispered "Be true to me"  
And she sighed: "Si, Si"  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons had passed away  
And still she's in my heart  
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town
