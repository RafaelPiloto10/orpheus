You love me more than those dirty clothes  
'Cause you can't imagine me as someone old  
But in the moment of sinless embrace  
Your eyes stare right through me to the back of my face  
  
I sleep all day  
(I sleep all day)  
You're the price I paid  
(You're the price I paid)  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown  
  
Talks of club connection was the way it began  
Not necessary dope but it was straight obsession  
Couldn't sleep it out but, oh hell, who needs sleep?  
Now you're six months later, it was, well, you know  
  
I sleep all day  
(I sleep all day)  
You're the price I paid  
(You're the price I paid)  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown  
  
I sleep all day  
(I sleep all day)  
You're the price I paid  
(You're the price I paid)  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown  
  
We're always good on the road  
(Now you, you were my favorite show)  
As long as buses were rollin' on  
The destination's unknown
