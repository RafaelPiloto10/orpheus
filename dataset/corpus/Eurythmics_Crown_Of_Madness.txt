My suit is mad. Of human hair  
My shoes are made of skin  
My shirt is made of vaseline  
From my knees up to my chin  
My jewellery is obscene  
But most of all it's fake  
My hat is made of solid gold  
It's the role I rightfully take  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Don't ask me to be faithful  
Don't ask me to be good  
Don't ask me to be generous  
I wouldn't if I could  
Don't ask me to be impolite  
You know I always will  
Don't ask me if I'm well  
When you know I'm always ill  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah, a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Don't ask me to be serious  
It's serious enough  
Don't try to make me understand  
Reality and stuff  
Don't push me to the limit  
Don't stretch your luck too far  
I know who I am  
Do you know who you are?  
Mad mad mad oooh  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah, a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Mad, mad, mad, mad
