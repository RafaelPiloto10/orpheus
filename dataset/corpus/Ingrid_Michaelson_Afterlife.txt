When the world is breaking down around you  
Taking everything that you know  
What you didn't know  
Is that we can go forever  
If we want to we can live  
Inside of a moment  
The one that we own  
  
You and me  
We got this  
You and me  
We're beautiful  
Beautiful  
  
We are  
We are going to be alright  
We got  
We got we always got the fight in us  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to live tonight  
Like there's no tomorrow  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
  
Living like you're dying  
Isn't living at all  
Give me your cold hands  
Put them on my heart  
Raise a glass to everyone  
Who thinks they'll never make it through  
This life  
To live a brand new start  
  
You and me  
We got this  
You and me  
We're beautiful  
Beautiful  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to be alright  
We got  
We got  
We always got the fight in us  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to live tonight  
Like there's no tomorrow  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
I hear your favorite song  
Telling me not run  
Not to worry anymore  
I can't hold on tight  
To nothing better than the rest  
So it's now  
Or never more  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to be alright  
We got the fight in us  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to live tonight  
Like there's no tomorrow  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to be alright  
We got  
We got  
We always got the fight in us  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to live tonight  
Like there's no tomorrow  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
'Cause we are the afterlife  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to be alright  
We got  
We got  
We always got the fight in us and  
  
We are  
We are  
We are going to live tonight  
Like there's no tomorrow  
'Cause we are the afterlife
