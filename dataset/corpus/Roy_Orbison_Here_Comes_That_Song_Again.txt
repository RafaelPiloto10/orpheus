Here comes that song again  
They're playing that song again  
I guess it will never end  
They're playing it again  
  
Here comes that song again  
Here comes that old ache again  
The story of my life begins  
They're telling it again  
  
I'll have to leave  
I can't bear it anymore  
There must be a place where  
They'll play a different score  
  
Here comes that song again  
The jukebox must have found a friend  
My heart will never mend  
They're playing it again  
  
Here comes that song again  
The jukebox must have found a friend  
My heart will never mend  
They're playing it again
