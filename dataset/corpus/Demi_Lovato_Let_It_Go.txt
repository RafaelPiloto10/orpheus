Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold you back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
  
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight  
Not a footprint to be seen  
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen  
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside  
Couldn't keep it in  
Heaven knows I try  
  
Don't let them in, don't let them see  
Be the good girl you always have to be  
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know  
Well now they know  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small  
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all  
Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe  
I know left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
Standing frozen in the life I've chosen  
You won't find me, the past is all behind me  
Buried in the snow  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
Let it go  
Here I stand  
Let it go, let it go  
Let it go
