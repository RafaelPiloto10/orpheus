I wander down these streets all by myself  
Think of my future now  
I just don't know  
I don't see to care  
I stop to notice that  
I'm by your home  
I wonder if you're sitting all alone  
Or is your boyfriend there  
  
Because I feel so right  
Let my imagination go  
Until you're in my sight  
And through my veins  
Temptation flows  
  
So I sit down here on the hard concrete  
Think of my future now  
I just don't know  
I don't seem to care  
So I sit across the street from your home  
I wonder if you're sitting all alone  
Or is your boyfriend there
