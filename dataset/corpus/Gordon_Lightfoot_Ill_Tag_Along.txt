You've got time enough for two of us  
What is mine, I will share  
We've got things that we can do without  
Most anytime, anywhere  
Every little daydream that appears in all we do  
Gives us some problems of our own  
If you turn back to that page again  
And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Paper matches in the afternoon  
Cups of tea and all of that Zen  
I think, it's time we took a walk outside  
It seems there is no oxygen  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust  
When we get back where we belong  
If you ever turn that page again  
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along
