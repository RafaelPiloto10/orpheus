I've been trying to open the door  
To the secret of my destiny  
And every new road I think is the one  
Seems to lead right back to me  
  
I've looked for a way to be wiser  
A way to be strong  
Now I see the answer was hiding  
In me all along  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm ready to fly  
Over the sun  
Like a rocket to heaven  
And I'm ready to soar  
Right through the sky  
Never dreamed I'd find something to lift me so high  
I've always had wings  
But I wasn't ready to fly  
  
Restless, hopeless, and misunderstood  
Like so many others I know  
So busy tryin' to keep holdin' on  
When I should've been letting go  
  
I was given the gift to find it  
The spirit inside me  
But I never really imagined  
All I could be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The answer to all of my wonder  
Was right in my hands  
Now it's time for me to discover  
All that I am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've always had wings  
Now I'm finally ready to fly
