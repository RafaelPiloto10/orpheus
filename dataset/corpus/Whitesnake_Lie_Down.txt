You got the smile of a Monalisa,  
Know it all an' giving nothing away.  
You make the sins of a vestal virgin,  
Look nothing more that a roll in the hay.  
  
So lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
  
You give an air of the Dolce Vita,  
Society's made a queen out of you.  
Casanova couldn't take all your virtue,  
But, rock 'n' roll is gonna steal it from you.  
  
So lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
  
Come on, girl, it'll be alright,  
Easy does it nice and slow.  
Woah, you know, mama, that tonight's the night,  
Come on and let your feelings show.  
  
Take a look in the mirror,  
Tell me what you see.  
If it ain't sweet surrender  
You can blame it on somebody, not the devil in me.  
  
So lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
  
(Solo)  
  
Take a look in the mirror,  
Tell me what you see.  
If it ain't sweet surrender  
You can blame it on somebody, not the devil in me.  
  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care.  
Lie down, I think I love you,  
Lie down, I think I care...
