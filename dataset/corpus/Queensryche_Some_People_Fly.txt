Used to be a time  
We held the world.  
Wrapped 'round our finger tips  
Laughing at what others missed. Someday, yesterday  
The magic we felt went away.  
Grow up somebody said tell me where it's gone  
So I can go find it now. I can't live your way.  
Go ahead without me.  
I'll find my own way  
  
Some people fly and some of us worry about touching  
The sun with wings. I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,  
Keeping my eyes on the sky.  
  
The box you live within is strong and it's up to you  
To see beyond the comfort zone you've grown to love.  
There's more to life than that. The expectations  
That you hold will keep you down and make you old  
If you can't see what I'm trying to say, maybe you just  
Need to wear my shoes for awhile. I can't live your way.  
Go ahead without me.  
I'll find my own way  
  
Some people fly and some of us worry  
I'd risk it all to have wings.  
I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,  
Keeping my eyes on the sky.  
  
While you sit there and think about it, there's another  
Unfolding their wings. I can tell you what it's like, but,  
Until you try, you'll never see what I mean.  
  
Some people fly and some of us worry  
I'll touch the sky with my wings.  
I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,  
Keeping my eyes on the sky.  
Keeping my eyes, keeping my eyes on the sky.
