Did we really ever try to understand each other?  
Or was it just a game that sometimes people play?  
Did we really ever see eye to eye, I wonder?  
Was it just a game that sometimes people play?  
[Sometimes people play]  
I wonder if  
We ever listened  
To a word  
That the other had to say  
All that we shared  
Our inner treasures  
Are used against each other as we fall  
Chorus  
I wonder if  
Before we started  
We could have known  
That the road would end this way  
What makes us give  
Our hearts so freely  
Only to find that we're strangers after all  
Chorus  
Night and day, night and day, day and night  
Night and day, people play, day and night  
We fool ourselves  
Into believing  
Our difference will surely change in time  
So we proceed  
Blissfully blinded  
Throwing caution to the wind along the way
