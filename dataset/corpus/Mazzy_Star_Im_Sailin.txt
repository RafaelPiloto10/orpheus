I'm sailin' sailin'  
To a place I've never seen  
That's way down south  
Sweet 'ol New Orleans  
Cause my hometown friend treats me awful mean  
  
If I could holler  
Yeah holler  
If I could scream and cry  
It hurts me so  
When I look up in the sky  
Cause my friends turn their heads  
As they pass me by  
  
Now it's rainin'  
It's rainin'  
The wind's blowin' cold  
Lord I thought I heard  
My train whistle blow  
Now I'm gonna sail so far  
Til I won't be back no more  
  
Pardon me, Pardon me  
It's so hard to stand  
I ain't got no money  
Uncle Sam has called my name  
Now there's not a soul  
To give me a helpin' hand
