Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Heaven knows I love you  
And heaven knows how true  
I'd be for you  
  
People have their failings  
And I know that I've got mine  
I know I've been ungrateful  
I know I've been unkind  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh come on Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Down into the valleys  
And out across the sea  
Our dreams go  
Caught up in a loving  
So much stronger than we knew  
That could tear our world apart  
Or with some fate just pull us through  
  
Gabriel oh Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Time will wait for no one  
And time will take it's toll  
And we'll grow old  
Weary from the fighting  
Worn out from a war  
Where no one can surrender  
Or wants to fight anymore  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Save this heart from hell  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
This heart's in hell  
  
Gabriel Gabriel  
Open you heart and mine as well  
Oh Gabriel Gabriel  
This heart's in hell
