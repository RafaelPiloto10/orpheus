Every night I have the same old dream  
'Bout you and me and what's in between  
So many changes, so many lies  
Try to run, try to hide  
  
From everything that I feel inside  
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes  
Searching in the darkness  
Fading out of sight  
  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
Stone Cold  
  
Can't break away from your spell  
Another dark and empty night  
If I was wrong I want to make it right  
But you are so distant, so far away  
  
Your words like ice fall on the ground  
Breaking the silence without a sound  
Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say  
Searching in the darkness  
  
Fading out of sight  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold  
Can't break away from your spell  
You leave me Stone Cold  
Searching in the darkness  
  
Fading out of sight  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold  
Can't break away from your spell  
You're Stone Coldyeah  
I can't break away from your spell  
  
Stone Cold baby  
I thought I knew you so well  
You're stone coldice cold  
Can't break away from your spell  
  
(You put me in the deep freeze)  
(Oh baby don't you leave me)  
(Stone cold, your leavin' me cold)  
Stone Cold, I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold, xan't break away from your spell
