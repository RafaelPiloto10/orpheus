There you were like a ghost from my early days, staring straight ahead at me.  
How could I ever guess, from that moment on, just how everything would change.  
How could I know?  
  
I recall something strange coming over me, somewhat at a loss for words.  
Id been around and had my share of what I thought my soul could bare, but
never seen what I saw in your eyes.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had and more.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had and more.  
  
Looking back at where weve been, the road ahead is so uncertain.  
We keep passing open windows forever.  
  
I've tried before Ill try again, I never know where were going.  
I only know that Ill be yours forever... Yours forever... Forever... Forever.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had.  
We gave it all we had.
