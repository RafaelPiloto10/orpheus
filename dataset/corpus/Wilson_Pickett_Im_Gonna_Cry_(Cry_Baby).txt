Cry, cry, cry baby, cry baby  
  
I knew from the start  
That you would break my heart, oh yeah  
I wanted you so bad  
Oh, you made me sad, child, oh yeah  
  
I'm gonna cry, yeah, yes, I  
(Cry baby, cry baby)  
  
Well, I thought I could love you  
Walk out and forget, yes, I did  
And now I can't have you, baby  
You know I'm all upset, child, oh, yeah  
  
And I'm gonna cry, yes, I, yes, I  
(Cry, cry baby, cry baby)  
  
If you knew she didn't love you, why did you kiss her lips?  
I never knew love could be this way, baby  
If you knew she didn't love you, why didn't you resist?  
This kinda woman is so doggone hard to find
