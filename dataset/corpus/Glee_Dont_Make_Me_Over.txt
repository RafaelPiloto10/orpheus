Ooh  
  
Don't make me over  
Now that I'd do anything for you  
Don't make me over  
Now that you know how I adore you  
  
Don't pick on the things I say, the things I do  
Just love me with all my faults, the way that I love you  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over  
Now that I can't make it without you  
Don't make me over  
I wouldn't change one thing about you  
  
Just take me inside your arms and hold me tight  
And always be by my side, if I am wrong or right  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over (oh ah)  
Don't make me over (ah)  
Now that you've got me at your command (ah oh)  
  
Accept me for what I am (ooh ah)  
Accept me for the things that I do (ooh ah)  
Accept me for what I am (oh ah)  
Accept me for the things that I do (oh ah)  
  
Now that I'd can't make it without you  
I wouldn't change one thing about you  
  
Just take me inside your arms and hold me tight  
And always be by my side, if I am wrong or right  
I'm begging you  
  
Don't make me over (ooh ah)  
Don't make me over (ah)  
Now that you've got me at your command (ah oh)  
  
Accept me for what I am (oh ah)  
Accept me for the things that I do (oh ah)  
Accept me for what I am (oh ah)  
Accept me for the things that I do (oh ah)
