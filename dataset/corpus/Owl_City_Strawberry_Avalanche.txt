This is a world of dreams and reverie  
Where I felt the stars explode around me  
A grass-blade flashed with a gleam  
As it slashed open a moon-beam  
And I stared back breathlessly  
As mountains of fruit tumbled out  
I barely had the chance to shout  
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me  
  
Staying awake that night was rather hard  
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard  
When we woke up buried alive  
Beneath a fruity landslide  
We both laughed hysterically  
It could have been just another dream  
But I swear I heard you scream  
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me  
  
Always a citrus constellation in the galaxy  
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids  
And I've been dying to see  
If you were a beautiful sound  
In the echoes all around  
Then I'd be your harmony  
And we'd sing along with the crowds  
Beneath the candy-coated clouds  
A strawberry avalanche, please crash over me  
  
This is a world of dreams and reverie  
Where I felt the stars explode around me
