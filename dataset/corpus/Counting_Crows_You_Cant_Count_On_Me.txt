Anythings hard to change  
But hey I got you down on your knees again  
You watch the sky  
It's a pale parade of passing clouds  
That cover  
The bed upon which we laid  
In the dark  
And the memories that I made  
Of a laughing girl  
But you're just my toy  
And I can't stop playing with you, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
If you think you need to go  
If you wanted to be free  
There's one thing you need to know  
And that's that you can't count on me  
  
Coming along real good  
But I still can't do most of the things I should  
I watch the sky coming down to bury me and  
I can't stop this crawling out of my skin  
I know that you see yourself flying in  
Out of the sky  
Coming down  
To carry me  
But I won't come out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No you can't count on me  
  
I watched all of the same parades  
As they passed on the days that you wish you'd stayed  
All this pain gets me high  
And I get off and you know why  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aw you can't count on me  
No you can't count on me
