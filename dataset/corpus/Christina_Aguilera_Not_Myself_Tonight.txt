You know tonight  
I am feeling a little out control  
Is this me  
You wanna get crazy  
Because I don't give a  
  
I'm out of character  
I'm in rare form  
And If you really knew me  
You'd know its not the norm  
  
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do  
The old me's gone I feel brand new  
And if you don't like it fuck you  
  
The music's on and I'm dancing  
I'm normally in the corner just standing  
I'm feeling unusual  
I don't care 'cause this is my night  
  
I'm not myself tonight  
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl  
  
I'm not myself tonight  
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl  
  
I'm dancing a lot and I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine  
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls  
Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind  
  
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do  
The old me's gone I feel brand new  
And if you don't like it fuck you  
  
The music's on and I'm dancing  
I'm normally in the corner just standing  
I'm feeling unusual  
I don't care cause this is my night  
  
I'm not myself tonight  
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl  
  
I'm not myself tonight  
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl  
  
In the morning  
When I wake up  
I'll go back to the girl I used to be  
But baby not tonight  
  
I'm not myself tonight  
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl  
  
I'm not myself tonight  
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl  
  
Yeah, that feels good  
I needed that  
Get crazy  
Let's go  
That's right  
Come on  
Give it to me now, don't stop
