Deep in my heart there's a fear  
And in my eyes you'll find a tear  
I'm scared that I'm losing you  
That's why I cry  
If I should lose you, little angel, I'd die  
Oh, little angel, I'd die  
Oh-oh, I had a dream and you were gone  
Without your love, I was alone  
So don't ever leave me and don't say goodbye  
If I should lose you, little angel, I'd die  
Oh, little angel, I'd die  
Deep in my heart, I have to know  
Your love is true, don't ever go  
So tell me I'm crazy to worry 'bout you  
Tell me that your love, little angel, is true  
Oh, that your love is true
