In an abandoned ware house with no lights just shadows and soon no rabbits.
The purpose of the event was to pass the torch. From one generation of heavy
metal to the next. And their lied... In his black leather hunting outfit with
shotgun guitar with spikes coming out of it, Ozzie Fudd the Rabbit Slayer!  
  
In the dead of night

In the dead of night  
A shimmerin' light  
Gleam of a blade  
And the devil was paid  
When the axe comes down  
A chilling sound  
Steel hits the head  
Another rabbit's dead  
I'm a rabbit slayer  
A guitar player  
With a nasty habit  
  
Kill the rabbit!  
Ahhhaahooohhh  
Be very very quiet!  
I'm lookin' for rabbits...  
  
I'm a mean mistreater  
A rabbit feaster  
And I predict  
A bloody Easter  
A scurrying shadow  
And the shadow was this rabbit  
And the night air echoes  
Kill the rabbit!  
Kill the rabbit!  
Kill the rabbit!  
Kill the rabbit!  
Kill the rabbit!  
Kill the rabbit!  
Kill the rabbit!  
Ohhhh... And there won't be any more rabbits around  
No more Roger Rabbit  
No more Peter Rabbit  
And no more Playboy Bunny Rabbits!  
Ah ha ha ha ha  
Be very very careful
