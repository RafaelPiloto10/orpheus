There's a flame that leads all souls astray  
No one's safe from its tender touch of pain  
Everyday it's looking for new slaves  
To celebrate the beauty of the grave  
  
We are like the living dead  
Sacrificing all we have  
For a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
We are like the living dead  
Craving for deliverance  
With a frozen heart and a soul on fire  
  
Again we're falling for disgrace  
And hate will shelter us from the rain  
We are enslaved by the sacred heart of shame  
And gently raped by the light of day  
  
Addicted to our divine despair  
The venom of the cross we bear  
The guilt will follow us to death
