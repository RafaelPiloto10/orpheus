[Chorus]  
When I'm sexing you, when I'm next to you, I know it's alright.  
It's the things you do make me cling to you, 'cause I know it's alright.  
  
There's a special way that you do what you do anywhere and anytime.  
You're not an ordinary lover, you give me sometimes keep me so satisfied.

I'm overwhelmed by the way that you handle, 'cause I been down for a little
while.  
I've got experience to know when it's this good everything, everything is
alright.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're here I don't fear, I feel so safe and secure, you feel good in my
arms,  
And I know you're the one.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How do I know you'll never go? You've got to be the one for me,  
I always pray that you will stay, so baby, don't you go.  
How do I know you'll never go? You've got to be the one for me,
