Bella bella bambina  
Bella bella bambina  
Mandolinas are playing songs of love they are saying  
Bella bella bambina  
Lips as sweet as ervina  
Bella bella bambina  
Bella bambina be mine  
Violets from the street vendor for the one I adore  
So that she will remember I am hers evermore  
Kisses thrilling and tender tell me as never before  
All my love I surrender true my bella amore  
Bella bella bambina  
Bella bella bambina  
Mandolins are playing songs of love they are saying  
Bella bella bambina  
Lips as sweet as ervina  
Bella bella bambina  
Bella bambina be mine  
Chapel bells will be ringing when she whispers si si  
How my heart will be singing love's sweet melody  
Skies above will be bringing sunshine and gladness to me  
Shoes and rice they'll be flinging what a day it will be  
Bella bella bambina  
Bella bella bambina  
Mandolins are playing songs of love they are saying  
Bella bella bambina  
Lips as sweet as ervina  
Bella bella bambina  
Bella bambina be mine
