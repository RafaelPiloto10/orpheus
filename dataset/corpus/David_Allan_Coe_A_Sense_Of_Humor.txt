Every night another woman every day a different town  
If I'm not accused of speeding I'm accused of coming down  
With a legal dose of something that you heard was going round  
And you wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Every song another record every day just like a clock  
Knowing well I've had to take it till I make it to the top  
With the devil right behind me and my heart about to stop  
Then you wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Twenty years I was in prison more than that I was alone  
Some lily-white reporter thinks it's time that I was stoned  
Without sin he wrote the story and it chilled me to the bone  
Then he wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
I shaved my beard and cut my hair off it don't matter anyhow  
It was truth that told the answers to the questions up till now  
Crucify him someone shouted from the safety of the crowd  
Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Hey take them crosses from my doorstep there's no reason to my rhyme  
Everybody knows somebody will take care of me in time  
I made friends of all you stand for but the blind can't lead the blind  
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor  
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor  
Cause if I ever catch you I'm gonna kick your ass
