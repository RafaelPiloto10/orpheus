If my heart has grown cold  
There Your love will unfold  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
When I'm blind to my way  
There Your Spirit will pray  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
  
Oceans will part nations come  
At the whisper of Your call  
Hope will rise glory shine  
In my life Your will be done  
  
Present suffering may pass  
Lord Your mercy will last  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
And my heart will find praise  
I?ll delight in Your way  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
