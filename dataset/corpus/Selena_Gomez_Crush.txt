I guess I should've known  
It wasn't gonna end okay,  
You're such a trouble maker  
But I like you just that way.  
  
A bomb tick ticking with me  
The one I'd best to blame  
Just like I can't tell  
And I'm ready to blow  
I sat around a lot and thought  
About the world without you  
And no matter what you think,  
Everything is not about you  
You think I'm still hung up on you  
But baby it's not true  
  
Now look at me  
Your memories're turning to dust  
There's only one explanation  
I wasn't really in love  
(I wasn't really in love)  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Sparks fly when we touch  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah  
  
You found one the things you need  
There's nothing left to lose  
The things I never wanna be  
I owe it all to you  
You just can't help yourself  
It's what you do  
Cause this is real life  
Not your show  
  
Now look at me  
The memories turn to dust  
There's only one explanation  
I wasn't really in love  
(I wasn't really in love)  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Sparks fly when we touched  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush  
Yeah,  
  
You'll be fine,  
Just find another girl  
To kick around  
Won't be long  
Until they all know what  
I figured out  
  
Now look at me  
Memories turn to dust  
There's only one explanation  
I wasn't really in love  
(I wasn't really in love)  
It was just a crush  
(It just was a crush)  
Sparks fly when we touched  
It was never enough  
It was just a crush  
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)  
Yeah  
(It was just a crush)  
It was just a crush  
Yeah.
