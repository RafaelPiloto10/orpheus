It was an early morning yesterday  
I was up before the dawn  
And I really have enjoyed my stay  
But I must be moving on  
  
Like a king without a castle  
Like a queen without a throne  
I'm an early morning lover  
And I must be moving on  
  
Now I believe in what you say  
Is the undisputed truth  
But I have to have things my own way  
To keep me in my youth  
  
Like a ship without an anchor  
Like a slave without a chain  
Just the thought of those sweet ladies  
Sends a shiver through my veins  
  
And I will go on shining  
Shining like brand new  
I'll never look behind me  
My troubles will be few  
  
Goodbye stranger it's been nice  
Hope you find your paradise  
Tried to see your point of view  
Hope your dreams will all come true  
  
Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane  
Will we ever meet again  
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame  
Come tomorrow, feel no pain  
  
Now some they do and some they don't  
And some you just can't tell  
And some they will and some they won't  
With some it's just as well  
  
You can laugh at my behavior  
That'll never bother me  
Say the devil is my savior  
But I don't pay no heed  
  
And I will go on shining  
Shining like brand new  
I'll never look behind me  
My troubles will be few  
  
Goodbye stranger it's been nice

Will we ever meet again?  
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame  
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

With some it's just as well

That'll never bother me  
Say the devil is my savior  
But I don't pay no heed
