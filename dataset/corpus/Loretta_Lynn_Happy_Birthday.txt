Well I know where you're going and who's gonna meet you there  
I know how late you'll be coming home but guess who doesn't care  
Tonight I'll step out too and since I won't be here  
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year  
My best wishes may be early but I'm not sticking around  
To bake a cake for your birthday while you're out turnin' around  
She can help you celebrate may she bring you lots of cheer  
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year  
[ guitar ]  
Now I've made my mind up late second's long enough  
You think I don't mean it so you're gonna call my bluff  
But I'll be busy packing while you're holding her near  
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year  
My best wishes may be early...  
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy happy New Year
