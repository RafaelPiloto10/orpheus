[Chorus:]  
Do you want to be in love forever  
Do you want to make my dream come true  
Let me be the one to kiss and hold you  
Say you'll be my baby  
Can you see the two of us together  
Living in love this whole life through  
Do you want to be in love forever  
Say you'll be mine  
  
I can remember  
When my mind was clear and free  
Now there's a feeling  
Coming over me  
The sweetest attraction  
That my heart has ever seen  
I'm going crazy making sense of anything  
  
(repeat chorus twice)  
  
I really wonder  
Is there magic in your smile  
Taking me under  
Got me acting like a child  
Something about you  
Hits me like avalanche  
I try to stand my ground  
But I don't stand a chance  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Every time I close my eyes I dream about  
Hugging you, holding you, kissing you boy  
It's driving me crazy  
But even if it takes forever  
To win your heart and your love and your devotion  
I know it's gonna be worth the wait  
  
Ooh, say you'll be my baby  
Ooh, be my baby  
Ooh, oh darlin', say you'll be mine  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Do you want to be in love  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Say you'll be my baby  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Do you want to be in love  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Say you'll be mine  
  
(repeat chorus)
