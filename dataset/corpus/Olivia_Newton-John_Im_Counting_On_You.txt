I'm counting on you  
Ever since we met darling  
I've been keeping score  
Every day I count your charms  
Every day I love you more  
It's plain to see why you're the lover I waited for  
  
I'm counting the different ways you melt me  
Your smile, your voice, your touch  
I'm counting the little things you tell me  
That move me, oh so much  
I'm counting your kisses and caresses  
And 'cause I thrill as I do  
For I'm counting on you  
  
I'm counting the hours since I found you  
The days and nights divine  
I'm counting the dreams I built around you  
Because your love is mine  
I'm counting on happiness forever  
Oh lover, always be true  
For I'm counting on you  
  
I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you
