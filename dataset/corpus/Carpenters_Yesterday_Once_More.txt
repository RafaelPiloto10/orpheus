When I was young I'd listen to the radio  
Waitin' for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile  
  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone  
But they're back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's, so fine  
  
When they get to the part  
Where he's breakin' her heart  
It can really make me cry, just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
  
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.  
  
It was songs of love that I would sing to then  
And I'd memorize each word  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
(All the oldies but goodies)  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine  
  
All my best memories come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry, just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine
