Love me forever  
Let me know that you'll  
Never leave me out in the cold  
Never leave me alone  
I'll show you devotion  
Can't control my emotion  
I've got love on my side  
Hey what a surprise  
They say love  
Is just infatuation  
I say love  
Is dancing 'cross the nation  
Love's so appealing  
Leaves you rockin' and reelin'  
How did it happen this time  
Got love on my mind  
Hold me and kiss me  
Tell me how much you missed me  
How can they keep us apart  
Got love in our hearts  
They say we're just  
Two more crazy lovers  
I say all we need  
Is one another  
Oh Lord how they gonna stop us today  
My word see how the passionless play  
Love me forever  
Let me know that you'll  
Never leave me out in the cold  
Never leave me alone  
I'll show you devotion  
Can't control my emotion  
I've got love on my side  
Hey what a surprise  
They say love  
Is just infatuation  
I say love  
Is dancing 'cross the nation  
Oh Lord how they gonna stop us today  
My word see how the passionless play  
Dancin' across the nation  
Dancin' across the nation
