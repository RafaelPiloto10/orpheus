I'll admit I could feel it  
The first time that we touched  
And the look in your eyes  
Said you felt as much  
  
But I'm not a man  
Who falls too easily  
It's best that you know  
Where you stand with me  
  
[Chorus]  
I will give you my heart  
Faithful and true  
And all the love it can hold  
That's all I can do  
'cause I've thought about  
How long I'll love you  
And it's only fair that you know  
Forever's as far as I'll go  
  
When there's age around my eyes  
And gray in your hair  
And it only takes a touch  
To recall the love we've shared  
  
I won't take for granted  
You'll know my love is true  
'cause each night in your arms  
I'll whisper to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tag  
Forever's as far as I'll go
