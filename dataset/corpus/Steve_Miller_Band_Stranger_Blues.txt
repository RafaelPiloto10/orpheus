Everybody's doggin' me around

They all should remember that they're  
They're gonna reap just what they sow

Sometimes I wonder do my baby know I'm here

Well, I'm goin' down south if I wear out 99 pair of shoes  
You know I will be welcome, I won't have these stranger blues

Well, the train stopped here cause the tracks are out of line  
Well, the train stopped here cause the tracks are out of line  
I'm gonna pack my bags
