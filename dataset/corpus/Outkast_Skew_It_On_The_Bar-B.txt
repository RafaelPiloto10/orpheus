The common denominator, the nigga numerator  
Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego  
I'm sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco, Vision  
Caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico, DeBarge  
He large and got a 'Llac in the garage  
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lawd  
One at Clark, one at Spelman  
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when  
He step off in the party women jump for joy  
But all the wild niggas schemin' they gon' jump the boy  
For spittin' all that bourgeoise, my watch, my car  
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far

Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso  
Grow hydro, then bag it up slow  
Price that, longevity suggest make moves slow  
Take time, grow eight, react nine, blow!  
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo  
Fly ride though, shit lookin wild dope  
Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go  
Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow  
Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those  
Glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows  
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes  
Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what?

Boi, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit  
We the type of people that don't bury the axe  
Or the hatchet, everytime we see your link we snatch it  
Ridin round our hood talkin' that dumb shit, your cabbage  
Is cracked, like plumber's ass, and summer's grass  
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin  
Thinkin' you're light skinned, aight then, lil' boy why you frightened?  
The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing  
I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic  
Because that Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right!  
College Park, East Point and Decatur they got my back, so  
We gon' keep on jammin and stabbin off in the track, ahh  
Think it's time to bungee but buddy we will be back  
And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Llac, know dat!
