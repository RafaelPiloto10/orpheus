I sit by the telephone  
Waiting for you to call me  
And when I'm alone in the night  
The blues start to fall on me  
Baby, I'm waiting for you  
And all that's on my mind  
Is what I'm gonna do  
  
My friends say I'm crazy  
And I'm wasting my time on you  
I'm breaking the rules  
And I'm way out of line it's true  
Baby, one night with you  
And they'd be goin' crazy too  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Here's my heart  
I'm getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time it's real  
  
All I keep thinkin' about  
Is the way that you do to me  
Baby, the wonder of you  
Has made the wonderful come true  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Here's my heart  
I'm getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time it's real  
  
I'm under your spell  
Of that I'm sure  
You can tell  
  
Sailin' along on a breeze  
Ooh, I'm flying  
Ooh, I'm skying  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Brand new start  
Here's my heart  
I'm getting ready for love  
I can feel  
This time it's real  
  
I'm getting ready for love  
Yes, I am  
Yes, I am  
I'm getting ready for love
