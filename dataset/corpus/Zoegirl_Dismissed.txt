How many times have you tried to pull one over on me?  
Always mess with me and try to get the best of me  
Lookin' back, all the pain that you put me through  
Why would i fall for a fool like you?  
Now you're talkin' like I've never played the game before  
Save your empty words 'cause I don't want to hear no more  
Basically you're trying to take control of me  
But you're not what i want to be  
  
I know everything about you  
Yesterday has come and gone  
I'd be better off without you  
No lookin' back, I'm moving on!  
  
You'll never steal the song of my lips  
I'll never bow down to give you a kiss, no  
You'll never steal my innocence  
You've been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
I'm never going back even if I see you around, no  
No, I'm never going down like this  
You've been dismissed  
  
Let me break it down one more time  
No, you're never gonna change my mind  
That was thenm this is now things are different, no  
Oh, you're not what I'm livin' for  
  
I know everything about you  
It's funny how the tables turned  
I'd be better off without you  
Now you're the one who's gettin' burned!  
  
You'll never steal the song of my lips  
I'll never bow down to give you a kiss, no  
You'll never steal my innocence  
You've been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
I'm never going back even if I see you around, no  
No, I'm never going down like this  
You've been dismissed  
  
On a falling star you got to where you are  
And you think you've got the right to own my heart  
But my affection doesn't lie in your direction  
You want to hold me with a lock and key  
Cover my eyes so i cannot see  
But in the end we all know who wins  
You are over, over, over  
  
You'll never steal the song of my lips  
I'll never bow down to give you a kiss, no  
You'll never steal my innocence  
You've been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
I'm never going back even if I see you around, no  
No, I'm never going down like this  
You've been dismissed
