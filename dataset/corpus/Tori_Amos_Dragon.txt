Don't tell me  
A woman did this to you  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
  
You touched my hand  
I felt a force  
You called it dark  
But now I'm not so sure  
  
Just stay awhile  
Stay awhile  
Stay awhile  
  
Why don't you  
Stay awhile  
Stay awhile  
  
Stay awhile  
  
Cause your wild card Boy needs playing  
Don't believe the lie  
Your dragon needs slaying  
Won't you lay here with me  
And I will bring  
Kisses for the beast  
  
Lay here with me  
Here with me  
  
Don't tell me  
A woman did this to you  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
  
When I look back over  
Documents and pages  
Ancient savageries  
  
Christened those inflated.  
Now it has come to light  
The Gods they have slipped up  
  
They forgot about the power  
Of a woman's love  
Just stay a while  
Stay awhile  
  
Stay awhile  
Why don't you  
Stay awhile  
Stay awhile  
  
Stay awhile  
Cause your wild card Boy needs playing  
Don't believe the lie  
Your Dragon needs slaying  
  
Won't you lay here with me  
And I will bring  
Kisses for the beast  
Lay here with me  
Here with me  
  
Don't tell me  
A woman did this to you  
  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
Candy lies  
Forgive my  
Candy lies
