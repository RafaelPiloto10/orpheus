We have the chance to turn the pages over  
We can write what we want to write  
We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older  
We're all someone's daughter We're all someone's son  
How long can we look at each other Down the barrel of a gun?  
You're the voice, try and understand it  
Make a noise and make it clear  
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo  
We're not gonna sit in silence  
We're not gonna live with fear  
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo  
This time, we know we all can stand together  
With the power to be powerful  
Believing we can make it better  
We're all someone's daughter  
We're all someone's son  
How long can we look at each other  
Down the barrel of a gun?
