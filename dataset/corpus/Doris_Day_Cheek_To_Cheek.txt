Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing (Swinging) cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill (Boot) me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
(Come on and) Dance with me  
I want my arms around you  
That (Those) charm about you  
Will carry me through  
  
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (Swinging)  
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
