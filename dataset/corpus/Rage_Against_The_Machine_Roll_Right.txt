Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like Ellison  
Main line adrenaline Gaza to Tienanmen  
From the basement I'm dwellin' in  
I cock back tha sling to stone a settler  
And breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter  
Here comes the hands on the leashes  
The cross, the capital, the pale families, the fear and the mouthpieces  
The single sista lynch  
The cell doors crash  
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo  
Roll right! Roll call!  
But now we're alright, we're all calm!  
Roll right! Roll call!  
And now we're alright, we're all calm!  
  
This hits like fists bomb with the left and don't miss  
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park  
Head crack, I hijack the papers  
The vapors caught fire up in your mind  
Come back rewind one time  
Here comes the hands on the leashes  
The cross, the capital, the pale families, the fear and the mouthpieces  
The single sista lynch  
The cell doors crash  
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo  
Roll right! Roll call!  
But now we're alright, we're all calm!  
Roll right! Roll call!  
  
We gotta take 'em to tha seventh level  
We gotta take 'em to tha seventh level  
For their lives and my lives were never settled  
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes  
Come on, come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes  
Come on  
  
Send 'em to tha seventh level!  
Send 'em to tha seventh level!  
Send 'em to tha seventh level!  
Send 'em to tha seventh level!  
For their lives and my lives were never settled
