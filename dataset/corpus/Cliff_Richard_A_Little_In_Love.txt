It's been so long  
You say you've had fun  
And you've been happy with the things you've done  
Now you feel strange and a little unreal  
Well I can understand the way you feel  
You're just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
You're just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
  
Well I can see what's happening to you  
You fell in love but it's just not true  
And there's one thing you ought to know  
I need you so I'm just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
I'm just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
  
You know sometimes you look somewhere  
You're not stone  
But there's no one there  
No one to turn to  
No one to see the way you're feeling  
A-just like me  
Just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
You're just a little in love  
(Just a little)  
  
You say you're willing to learn  
You need a friend  
A friend who will help you  
  
'cause you're just a little in love  
Oh yeah a little in love  
You are a little in love  
With someone you just like to see  
Like me, you're in love  
Oh yeah, a little in love  
You're in love
