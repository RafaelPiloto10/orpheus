Do you remember one September afternoon  
I stood with you and listened to a wedding tune,  
And didn't I go with you on your honeymoon?  
Remember me?  
  
Do you recall a cottage small upon a hill  
Where ev'ry day I had to pay another bill?  
And if I'm not mistaken, dear, I pay them still  
Remember me?  
  
I can see that little angel on your knee  
Can't you see, He kinda sorta looks like me  
For I'm the boy whose only joy is loving you  
Who worries till he hurries home when day is through  
And I'm the guy you give you goodnight kisses to  
Remember me?
