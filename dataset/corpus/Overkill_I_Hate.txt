Got so much trouble  
Hate this job  
Tried to get out  
Trapped like a dog  
No I don't like  
  
Pumpin' gas  
Do ya hate to wait  
Life's a game  
Play your rules  
Is the bottle half empty  
Or the bottle half full  
It does no good  
No good to shout  
But I scream I hate  
Say I'm hostile  
Gotta relax  
Better get a grip  
Here's the facts  
I hate bein' here.  
  
I hate people that make ya feel small  
I hate having my back against the wall  
I hate bein' talked down to  
I hate your rules  
I hate them all  
Hate bein' marked to take the fall  
Planet's not big enough for me and you  
  
Got trouble over me  
Surrounded by jerks  
Can't ya see  
Smile to my face  
Know ya lie  
Knife in my back another game  
Rules, rules, rules  
Not for me,  
You fuckin' fool.  
  
So open your mouth  
One more time  
And my foot is goin' down  
In one ear  
Out the other  
A waste of time  
Don't even bother  
I hate bein' here  
  
Think I know  
How ya got this far  
Think I know  
Got where we are  
Think I'll hate you  
Where you'll be dead  
I know it, I hate you  
Smile to my face  
Know to die  
Says the problems  
Ask your self way  
Hate the games  
Hate the rules  
You're gonna loose  
Say I'm hostile  
Gotta relax  
Better get a grip  
Here's the fact  
Not much more of you
