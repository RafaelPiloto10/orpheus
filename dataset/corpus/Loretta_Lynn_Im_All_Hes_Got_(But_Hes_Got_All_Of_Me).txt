No he's not a man who brags about his good look wealth or fame  
Though his reputations talk about but he don't hide a thing  
He lives the way he wants to live and that's how he should be  
I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
Yes I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
I'll be contented in his loving arms eternaly  
For could he give me more than love how richer could I be  
I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
[ steel - piano ]  
Yes we have a lot in common and that's more than others have  
Take you preachin' out for something but there's nothing there to brag  
His love is all he has to give but he gives it all to me  
I'm all he's got but he's got all of me  
Yes I'm all he's got...
