Who's the one to knock me over?  
Who's the one to take me by surprise?  
Who's the one who's out to get me?  
Who will share my fantasy tonight?  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be anyone  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be you, it could be anyone  
Do you really know the story?  
Have you really come to see the band?  
Can you reach out for the glory?  
Can you feel the nearness of my hand?  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be anyone  
If you look a little harder  
You can see we're really all the same  
And if you look a little deeper  
Can't you see it's really all a game?  
It could be you, instead of me  
It could be anyone  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be you, it could be anyone
