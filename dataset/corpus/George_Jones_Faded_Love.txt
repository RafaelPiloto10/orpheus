As I look at the letter that you wrote to me it's you that I am thinking of  
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet I remember our faded love  
I miss you darling more and more every day as heaven would miss the stars
above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you and remember our faded love  
  
I think of the past and all the pleasures we've had as I watch the mating of
the dove  
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye I remember our faded love  
I miss you darling more and more
