Ray Charles  
Jimmy Lewis (indented)  
[both together]  
  
[Uh-Uh]  
Wait a minute, Jimmy, look here  
I'm listenin'  
As I was wakin' up this mornin'  
Well well  
Oh Lord, you know I felt pretty good, Yes I did  
I began to stretch and yawn  
What for Ray?  
Just to see if I could  
I can dig it  
  
All at once I got a funny feelin'  
That something around here was goin on wrong  
Hmm  
So you know what I did Jimmy?  
What?  
I got up and I began to look all around for my baby  
Was that it?  
That was it, you know the woman had packed up and gone  
Oh lord  
  
That's why I say if everybody went to heaven  
Hey-ey-ey, I believe I'd miss the call  
But you see if it wasn't for bad luck,  
Trying to tell you son if it wasn't for bad luck, now now  
Oh, oh, I wouldn't have no luck at all  
Would you believe I wouldn't have no luck at all  
  
Looka here Ray, you think your luck is bad?  
Listen ta what happen to me  
Alright  
Now listen now  
Got a tip on a horse someone gave me, hey hey  
Yeah  
Pawned my last suit to make the bet  
No you didn't  
Yes I did  
Put every dime I had on him, ah  
What?  
Listen, you know he ain't showed up yet  
  
Oh! Tell ya I got so disgusted now  
Yeah  
Said I'll go back home and sleep some more  
Now that seem like the right thing to do  
But by the time I got back to my room  
Are you listenin' Ray?  
Yeah yeah, I'm payin' attention  
You know the landlord had padlocked my door  
Why that dirty . . .  
  
Tell ya a slow horse and a fast woman  
Hey hey hey lord they sure did let me fall  
That's why I say ah  
If it wasn't for bad luck sugar now  
Hey if it wasn't for bad luck y'all  
Oh! I wouldn't have no luck at all  
  
Oh Ray, listen, I wouldn't have no luck at all  
Huh-Yep. But wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet  
Let me tell you what happened  
Tell me about it  
  
I decided I'd go out walkin'  
Say what?  
Um-hm. And you know even that failed  
Now how can a walk fail, Ray?  
Because some man snatched a woman's pocketbook way across town  
Say what?  
Yeah, and uh guess who they put in jail?  
Do tell, do tell  
  
Jimmy, I just can't understand it  
I know what you mean  
I know there's got to be some kind of explanation  
There's got to be, there's got to be  
Lord, lord, lord, lord I ain't done nothing wrong  
So tell me why I'm doing two years probation  
Man I don't know, I got the same trouble  
  
They got me having to walk a chump line  
Say what?  
Oh, with my, with my back up against a wall  
That's tough, Ray  
That's why if it wasn't for bad luck sugar  
Oh I tell everybody if it wasn't for bad luck now now  
I believe, I believe I would have no luck at all  
I just would have no luck at all  
Looka here Ray, let me tell you something  
Hm?  
Now you know, you know about this here  
Yeah  
You know I was sittin' home one evening,  
Well I didn't have a thing to do  
Yeah, that's happened to me sometimes  
So I thought I'd go out dancin', you know  
Yeah, yeah  
And do a little of that boogaloo  
I, I kinda like that myself  
Finally, I got myself a partner, now  
Yeah  
But old Ray, wouldn't you know  
Mm-hm, somthing musta happened bad  
Some man said, "You got my woman, boy"  
Uh oh  
And he stood about seven foot four  
Oops! Oops!  
As they walked away I stood there  
Feeling kinda sad and kinda small  
That's why I say If it wasn't for bad luck sugar  
  
[whoa, if it wasn't for bad luck, y'all now  
hey, hey, hey, we'd have no luck at all]  
  
Hey now!  
Yeah, I say we would have no luck at all  
Jimmy, I want you to tell me about that  
seven foot four What did you do!  
Well Ray, anytime a man is seven foot four and you  
messin' with his woman, it's time for you to go  
Oh yeah?  
Lord have mercy  
I, I, I, I can understand it,  
it made you feel like you want to holler a little bit  
Made me feel like I want to Aahhhhhhh-ow!  
Yeah man, when I run into that situation,  
makes me want to cry a little bit like this Ooh-hoo!
