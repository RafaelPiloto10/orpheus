I've been havin' trouble puttin' my cigarettes out. and I've been having
trouble with her. so I shut up...or talk too loud. the cigarettes smolder and
smell, but they light up the room. so many times I think of romance, but I
think I should leave you alone. when I get home... I'm gonna hang that picture
where it' supposed to be. then I think I'll get up... and watch the sun go
down. watch the sun go down. watch the sun go down. watch the sun go down.
watch the sun go down. I wish I wasn't grown-up, so I could cry myself to
sleep. and I'd like to follow you home, but it's awful hard on the bus.
everybody's got the right to wrong. they come home and say "I'm sorry...". but
I'm gone for 6 months at a time, and you're tired of the reason why. when I
grow up... I'm gonna make something out of myself. then I think I'll get up...
and watch the sun go down. watch the sun go down. watch the sun go down. watch
the sun go down. when the sun goes down.
