It must have been Moonglow,  
Way up in the blue,  
It must have been Moonglow,  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you sayin'  
Dear one hold me fast,  
And I start to prayin'  
Oh Lord, please let this last,  
We seem to float right through the air,  
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere,  
And now when there's Moonglow,  
Way up in the blue,  
I always remember,  
That Moonglow gave me you  
That Moonglow gave me you  
  
We seem to float right through the air,  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere,  
And now when there's Moonglow  
Way up in the blue,  
I always remember,  
That Moonglow gave me you,  
That Moonglow gave me you,  
That Moonglow gave me you
