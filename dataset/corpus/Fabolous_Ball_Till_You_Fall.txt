[Chorus:]  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So you'd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall  
  
It don't stop y'all [x4]  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm the substitution, I came in this game as a helpin' hand  
In the post when I'm close I'm like Elton Brand  
My passes go around the ball like a belt through pants  
And I'm for the green yeah somethin like a Celtics fan  
Me and my team came in G4 dozen seaters  
Just in time, call us the buzzer beaters  
It's big shot Fab, I spin like vinyl records  
You could tell I want the ball in the final seconds  
I keep some change on me  
I'm a winner I should be in the locker room lettin 'em pour champagne on me  
My hommies got a soft one, throw me in a lob one  
Good on the first three, I'm Kobe on this fourth one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So you'd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall  
  
It don't stop y'all [x4]  
  
[Verse:]  
Oh man the children have seen us  
We fill the arenas  
The hottest tour, I wizz through'em like Gilbert Arenas  
Imma ball till I fall and I'm restin in heaven  
In the 60 I-L that's the best of the sevens  
No games played your boy dropped through like the????  
In the passenger I'm mashin'em  
Dunkin off the glass on'em  
These other players with full court press harassin'em  
Yeah I'm in the zone  
Colors in the stones  
They look, they hook'em sorta like they playbook  
That's the flagrant foul that could get you a suspension  
They want me to dunk on'em just to get them some attention  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So you'd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall  
  
It don't stop y'all [x4]  
  
[Verse:]  
And I'm a baller  
Saw'em carryin this shit  
My Suns with me like Stoudamire, Marion and Nash  
Just like the Lakers during showtime  
With the slow rhyme you know I'm gonna step it up during O-Time  
Back like the Cavs with Lebron  
Your boy be havin it on  
White and gold gleam on the whole team  
I spin like a mixer  
Sorta like a trickster  
The S-I to the X, I call'em the Sixers  
I beg your pardon I should live with the guards  
I spend my time point guardin'  
Amx black car, nothin with the plastic  
Its goes through like we cuttin to the basket lookin for the hoop  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just ball till you fall  
Cuz imma ball until I fall  
So you'd better ball until you fall  
Just ball till you fall  
  
It don't stop y'all [x4]  
  
[Ending:]  
Capital L Capital O Capital S Capital O
