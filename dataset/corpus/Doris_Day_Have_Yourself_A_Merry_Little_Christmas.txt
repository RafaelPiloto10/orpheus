Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
Next year all our troubles will be miles away  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once mor-oree  
Someday soon we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then we'll have to muddle through some how  
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now...
