It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you  
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?  
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC  
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)  
This MC stands for "Microphone Commando"  
When I command that you take a hand  
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now  
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)  
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)  
A battle, put me in it, I win it  
The mission is music and rhythm  
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system  
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in  
Heart into the music, music I take part in  
One try, one God, and one destiny  
Just dance for me  
"Dance to the music" (Repeat 2x)  
Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to  
My brother Lance said "Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet"  
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat  
Ample samples, this for example  
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel  
Your plans of moving to the front lines  
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine  
I hop, dip, and spend with the children  
So get down with the sound and you will lend  
To let me bring while I bring  
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating  
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit  
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it  
So if you want to know what the plan is to be  
I order you to dance for me  
"Dance to the music" (Repeat 2x)  
My voice is your choice at a stage show  
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say "ho"  
With powerful lyrics I'm armed  
To let a sucker step up and get bombed  
By a beat created by my producer  
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to  
This here is a moment of truth  
So take the record to the DJ booth  
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb  
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some  
People dancing, I can spot 'em  
When I take control, you know I got 'em  
Stop the music? That's not a question  
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions  
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be  
I order you to dance for me  
"Dance to the music" (Repeat 6x)
