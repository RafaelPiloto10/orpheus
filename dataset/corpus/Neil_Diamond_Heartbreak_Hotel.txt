Now, since my baby left me  
I've found a new place to dwell  
Down at the end of lonely street  
At Heartbreak Hotel  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
Although it's always crowded  
You still can find some room  
For broken hearted lovers  
To cry away their gloom  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
The bell hop's tears keep flowing  
The desk clerk's dressed in black  
They've been so long lonely street  
They will never go back  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
So if your baby leaves you and you have a tale to tell  
Just take a walk down lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel  
  
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die
