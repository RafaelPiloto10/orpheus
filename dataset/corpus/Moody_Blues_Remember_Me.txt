You don't need to ask me if i'll be your friend  
I am  
I am  
You don't need to ask me if I'm sure my friend  
I am  
  
I am your friend  
You must remember me  
I'm the one who saw through the world's disguise  
Took away its cloak and I made it hide  
From me  
Remember me?  
  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
What can I say  
You don't need to find the words to say what's on your mind  
  
If you need a reason to begin again  
I am  
I am  
You will find an answer at your journey's end  
I am  
Waiting there my friend  
You must remember me  
I'm the one who knew you when  
I'm the one you call your friend  
Feel free  
Remember me  
  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
What can I say  
You don't need to find the words to say what's on your mind  
  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
What can I say  
You don't need to find the words to say what's on your mind  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
  
Walking on this earth finding you  
You, you  
You, you  
You, you  
You, you
