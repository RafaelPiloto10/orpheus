There's nothing outside my window  
But the sound of the pouring rain  
It oughta be breaking my heart  
But I feel no pain  
Trying to pick up the station  
That'll carry me through this night  
Got a fire to keep me warm  
'Til I got you in my arms  
  
Holding out, dug in deep  
I got an island that I'm gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out  
  
Girl, I've been dreaming about you  
For the better part of my life  
At least I can make it without you  
One more night  
  
I'm not afraid of the thunder  
I won't run away from the storm  
Let the stars fall down and break  
I don't care how long it takes  
  
Holding out, dug in deep  
I got an island that I'm gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out  
  
There's no other love in the world  
I could want any more  
  
Holding out, dug in deep  
I got an island that I'm gonna keep  
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep  
Holding out  
Oh yeah  
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out
