[Verse 1]  
I don't know where to begin,  
Fighting a war I can't win, fighting a memory  
Something that used to be,  
No matter how hard I fight,  
All of my strength and might,  
Keeps on defeating me, it just keeps on defeating me.  
  
[Chorus]  
So what I'm trying to say, I know what's happening,  
Your body is here with me,  
But your heart and your mind is still with him.  
  
Go back to what you know,  
Go back to where you know where your heart is,  
Girl, just be honest, this is impossible,  
This is impossible, we'll never work cause you don't want it,  
Girl, you belong with him so just go back to what you know,  
Go back to what you know, because this is impossible.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Telling me things that you two, did when he was with you,  
How he was oh so sweet, the way that he used to treat you,  
Instead you just can't keep him outta your mind.  
Why can't you just tell me that I'm not who you want to be,  
Baby you don't want me, no, no, no.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go back to what you know,  
Go back to where you know where your heart is,  
Girl, just be honest, this is impossible,  
This is impossible, we'll never work cause you don't want it,  
Girl, you belong with him so just go back to what you know,  
Go back to what you know, because this is impossible.  
  
[Bridge]  
And if that was really what you want,  
I will not stand in your way, you want to be free  
I will let you be,  
I rather you have me, than miserable with me,  
Back to what you know,  
Back to what you know,  
Said back to what you know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So there ain't no need to make those lies  
You're stuck in the past,  
Pedal to the gas and drive away
