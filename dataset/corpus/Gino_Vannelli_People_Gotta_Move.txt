People come on and do it right  
Shake your behinds like dynamite  
Chuck all your worries and toss your thighs  
To be tame is a pain when you realize  
  
You gotta move  
People gotta move  
  
Shake all your brains and pump your heart  
Show all the world what you are  
You come on for right, you come on for wrong, you come on for zeal  
'Cause the tones of your bones makes you feel  
  
You gotta groove  
People gotta move
