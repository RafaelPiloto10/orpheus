Well just got back  
Been gone too long  
Wasn't my idea, didn't pull the trigger  
Oh oh oh I I I I'm just so glad  
I'm just so glad to be back home, yeah  
  
I just got back  
Been a long long time  
Wasn't my idea, didn't point the finger  
Oh oh oh I I I I'm just so glad  
I'm just so glad to go home  
  
You run the risk of falling  
With some solitary Sam  
I've sailed the seven sins a poly-future plan  
  
A Paul calypso  
Isn't really what it seems  
This ain't committee art  
My god, is it a dream?  
  
I just got back  
I been asleep too long  
Wasn't my idea what the doctor figured  
Oh oh oh I I I I'm just so glad  
I'm just so glad, I'm just so glad, I'm just so glad  
To be back home  
No no no no no no no no  
I'm just so glad  
No no no no no no no no  
I'm just so glad
