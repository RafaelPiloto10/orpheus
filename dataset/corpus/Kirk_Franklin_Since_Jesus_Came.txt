[Verse 1]  
I was so sad, no love around  
my heart was truely broken  
and then in the open  
out from no where  
i haven't been the same since that day  
  
[Chorus]  
You got my face glowin  
and i dont care who knows it  
rivers of joy are flowin  
[sopranos]  
ever since you came  
bands on it  
so put yo hands on it  
we got yo feet a stompin  
  
[sopranos]  
since Jesus came into my life  
he changed the darkness into light  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh happy day I'm here again  
every day with you is -  
you took my hand helped me understand  
how to trust you all the way  
Lord you got my face  
  
[chorus]  
You got my face glowin  
and i dont care who knows it  
rivers of joy are flowin  
[sopranos]  
ever since you came  
bands on it  
so put yo hands on it  
we got yo feet a stompin  
  
[sopranos]  
since Jesus came into my life  
he changed the darkness into light  
  
[sopranos]  
since Jesus came into my life  
he changed the darkness into light
