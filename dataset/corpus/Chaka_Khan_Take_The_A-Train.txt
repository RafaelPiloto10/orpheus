Hurry, hurry, hurry  
Take the A-train  
To find the quickest way to get to Harlem  
  
If you should take the A-train  
You'll find you get right where you goin'  
If you hurry  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry  
Night's coming  
Can't you hear the rails a-humming  
  
If you should take the A-train  
You'll find to get away  
With a hurry  
  
If you should take the A-train  
You'll find you get right where you goin'  
If you hurry  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry  
Night's coming  
Can't you hear the rails a-humming
