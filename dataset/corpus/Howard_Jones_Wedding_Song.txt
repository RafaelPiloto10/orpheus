I can see you  
On your wedding day  
With the one you love  
To share the way  
A life ahead of you  
Youth left behind  
Go out and make yourself  
Some memories  
despair and pleasure  
Faced at every turn  
And there's children  
To save from harm's way  
Three thousand doorways  
Reveal a thousand more  
Treasure each moment  
Forever more  
I promise to love you and do my best for you  
I need you to help me to find my strength  
Walk with me all through my life  
My lover my husband my wife  
Share this journey with me  
Write this story with me  
Life comes and it will go  
And there's no time to sit and watch the grass grow  
When we are old and grey you know we'll say  
We went and made ourselves some memories  
We're starting our life  
We're starting together now  
I need you to help me to find my strength  
Walk with me all through my life  
My lover my husband my wife  
Share this journey with me  
Write this story with me
