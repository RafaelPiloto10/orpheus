God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly Father, a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
