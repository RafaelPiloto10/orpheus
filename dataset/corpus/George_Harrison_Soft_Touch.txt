You're a soft touch baby  
Like a snowflake falling  
My whole heart is melting  
As a warm sun rises  
Into joy, I'm sailing  
To your soft touch baby  
Eyes that shine from depths of your soul  
Fixed by their charm, take my control  
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide  
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side  
As a cool wind blows me  
All the treetops whisper  
To your soft touch baby  
As a new moon rises  
Those ideas of Heaven  
Fall in your soft touch, baby  
Eyes that shine from depths of your soul  
Fixed by their charm, take my control  
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide  
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side  
You're a soft touch baby  
Like a snowflake falling  
My whole heart is melting  
As a warm sun rises  
Into joy I'm sailing  
To your soft touch baby  
You're a soft touch baby  
Yes, I love that soft touch  
Hmm, that soft touch  
You're a soft touch baby  
Yes, I love that soft touch
