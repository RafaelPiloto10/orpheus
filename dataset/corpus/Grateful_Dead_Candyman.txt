Come all you pretty women  
With your hair hanging down  
Open up your windows 'cause  
The candy man's in town  
Come on boys and gamble  
Roll those laughing bones  
Seven come eleven boys  
I'll take your money home  
  
Look out  
Look out  
The candy man  
Here he come  
And he's gone again  
Pretty lady ain't  
Got no friend  
Till the candy man  
Come round again  
  
I come in from Memphis  
Where I learned to talk the jive  
When I get back to Memphis  
Be one less man alive  
Good Morning Mr. Benson  
I see you're doing well  
If I had me a shotgun  
I'd blow you straight to Hell  
  
Look out  
Look out  
The candy man  
Here he come  
And he's gone again  
Pretty lady ain't  
Got no friend  
Till the candy man  
Come round again  
  
Come on boys and wager  
If you have got the mind  
If you got a dollar boys  
Lay it on the line  
Hand me my old guitar  
Pass the whiskey round  
Want you to tell everybody you meet  
The candy man's in town  
  
Look out  
Look out  
The candy man  
Here he come  
And he's gone again  
Pretty lady ain't  
Got no friend  
Till the candy man  
Come round again
