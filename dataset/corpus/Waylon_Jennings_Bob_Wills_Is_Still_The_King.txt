Here's a song I wrote on a plane between Dallas and Austin  
Goin' to El Paso  
Whoops  
Now this is what gave us the idea to come down here,  
This is a song about a guy that probably did as much for  
Our kind of music as anybody.  
  
Well the Honky Tonks in Texas were my natural second home  
The way you tip your hat to the ladies in the rose of San Antone  
  
I grew up on music that we call western swing  
It don't matter whose in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King  
  
Lord, I can still remember the way things were back then  
In spite of all the hard times I'd live it all again  
To hear the Texas Playboys and Tommy Duncan sing  
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the King  
  
You can hear the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville Tennessee  
Its the home of country music on that we all agree  
But when you cross that ol' Red River hoss,  
That just don't mean a thing  
Once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King  
  
If you ain't never been there, then I guess you aint been told  
That you just can't live in Texas unless you got alot of soul  
Its the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing  
He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the King.
