The hangman's noose won't get me  
Gas chambers never stress me  
The can line me up against the wall  
  
No firing squad will make me  
Confess or even break me  
I'll stand alone or not at all  
I will not obey  
I will not betray  
I will not give in  
Not while I'm living  
  
No surrender  
We never will surrender  
  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
  
No shackles made will chain me  
No endless pain will change me  
The scars will testify this all  
  
No solitary confinement  
Will break my strong resignment  
I'll die before I will conform  
I will not obey  
I will not betray  
I will not give in  
Not while I'm living  
  
No surrender  
There'll never be surrender  
  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
  
Read in my obituary  
Defiance breeds victory  
  
No cage they make can hold me  
No law enforced controls me  
No trap that's sprung stops me for long  
No prison cell contains me  
No snare they set will claim me  
Relentlessly I'll fight them all  
  
I will not obey  
I will not betray  
I will not give in  
Not while I'm living  
  
No surrender  
We never will  
Be driven asunder  
No surrender  
We never will  
Raise the white flag  
  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
We are all dead meat  
Cut us, watch us bleed  
  
Indoctrination  
Will never  
Suppress me  
They're seriously mistaken  
'Cause I'll take them  
Down with me  
And just before they're finished  
They'll scream along with me  
We are all dead meat
