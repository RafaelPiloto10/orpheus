Sally dances on the floor  
She says that she can't do it anymore  
She walks down St. Marks Place  
And eats natural food at my place  
  
Now Sally can't dance no more  
she can't get it off of the floor  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally, she can't dance no more  
  
Sally is losing her face  
She lives on St. Marks Place  
In a rent-controlled apartment, eighty dollars a month  
She has lots of fun, she has lots of fun  
  
But, Sally can't dance no more  
Oh Sally she can't dance no more  
She went and carried on and can't get off of the floor  
Now Sally, oh she can't dance no more  
  
She was the first girl in the neighborhood  
To wear tied-dyed pants, like she should  
She was the first girl that I've ever seen  
That had flowers painted on her jeans  
Now she wears a sword, like Napoleon  
And she kills the boys and acts like a son  
  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally, hey she can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance  
Sally can't dance  
  
She knew all the really right people  
She went to Les Jardins  
She danced with Picasso's illegitimate mistress  
and wore Kenneth Lane jewels, really hey, it's trash, but  
  
Sally, can't dance no more, yeah  
Sally, she can't dance no more, you tell 'em about it  
Sally can't get herself off the floor  
Hey, Sally, girl, she can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance  
Sally can't dance  
  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)
