You've got a life somewhere without me  
I've gone on without you  
It hasn't been easy getting used to  
Being lonely and tonight is an all night blue  
And I wonder how you look and who looks at you  
In your nightgown  
I can almost feel your body  
Your warm and loving body when I lay down  
Chorus:  
It's an all night blue  
Remembering you  
It's an all night blue  
Wondering who's loving you ... all night  
Well it hurts me to see that you're  
Happy without me cause I still need you  
I just drank up my heart  
Set it empty on the table 'cause I  
Ain't got nothing better to do  
Still I wonder how you look and  
Who looks at you every morning  
I can still feel your warm breath  
You kissing me on the chest  
I'm just dreaming  
Chorus
