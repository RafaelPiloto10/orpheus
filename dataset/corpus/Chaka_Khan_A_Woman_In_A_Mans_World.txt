It's a losing game I play  
In a dog eat dog, show biz town  
I've got a dream of my own  
And I carry my own weight  
But still they try to drag me down  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a woman in a man's world  
I'm a woman in a man's world  
  
So I'm fool enough to say  
That a woman's place is in the home  
Working twice as hard  
For the same reward as any man, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For my very own  
It'll make me strong if I don't give in  
Cause the harder the fight  
Oh, the sweeter the prize I'm sure to win
