Leave them behind, those clouds of trouble  
We have to find a world that's new  
Buy a new dress and go out dancing  
Do all the things you want to do  
For heaven's sake, you have to break away  
Unchain yourself, from the mood of today  
  
We don't need aggression  
We don't need recession  
  
Just give us some money  
Our life could be sunny too  
  
We don't need regression  
Or means of repression  
Our life could be sunny too ,ooh  
  
Our lives should be so full of laughter  
With endless joy to follow after  
Summer comes to girls and boys  
Never too late, but to enjoy, to enjoy  
  
Oh come on down from your ivory tower  
Unlock the doors and give us flowers  
We've worked for you now for too long  
We've done what's right, you've done us wrong  
For heaven's sake, we got to break away  
Unchain yourself, from the mood of today  
  
We don't need regression  
Make your impression  
  
Oh, world is waiting  
We need to go out dancing  
Oh, world is waiting  
We need a new t.v.  
Oh, world is waiting  
We don't need fear and fighting  
Oh, world is waiting  
We don't need history  
  
She should buy us all a drink  
She should buy us all a drink  
She should stop the pain, stop the pain  
She should buy us all a drink  
  
Yeah  
  
We don't need recession (We don't need recession)  
Or means of repression (Or means of repression)  
  
Just give us some money (Just give us some money)  
Our life could be sunny too  
  
Just give us some money  
Our life could be sunny too, ooh  
  
She should stop and think, stop and think, oh  
  
We don't need regression (We don't need regression)  
Or means of repression (Or means of repression)  
  
Just give us some money (Just give us some money)  
Our lives could be sunny too, ooh
