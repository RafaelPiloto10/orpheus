O Sacred King, O Holy King  
How can I honour You rightly,  
Honour that's fit for Your name?  
O Sacred friend, O Holy friend  
I don't take what You give lightly  
Friendship instead of disgrace.  
For it's the mystery of the universe  
You're the God of holiness,  
Yet You welcome souls like me  
And with the blessing of Your Father's heart  
You disciple the ones You love  
There's kindness in Your majesty  
Jesus those who recognise Your power  
Know just how wonderful You are  
That You draw near
