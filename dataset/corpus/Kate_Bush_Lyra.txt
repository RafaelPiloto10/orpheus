Where are our lives?  
If there is no dream  
Where is our home?  
  
We don't know how  
There will be a way  
Out of the storm  
We will find home  
  
And her soul  
Walks beside her  
An army stands  
Behind her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And her face  
Full of grace  
Two worlds collide  
Around her  
The truth lies  
Deep inside her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And the stars  
Look down upon her  
As darkness  
Settles on her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
Who's to know  
What's in the future  
But we hope  
We will be with her  
We have all our love  
To give her  
Oh  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And her soul  
Walks beside her  
An army stands  
Behind her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And her face  
Full of grace  
Two worlds collide  
Around her  
The truth lies  
Deep inside her  
Lyra, Lyra
