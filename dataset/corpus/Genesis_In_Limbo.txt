Please take me away  
Far from this place  
Leaving me here  
Take me away  
  
To the furthest star in the sky  
Take me away  
To the deepest cave of the night  
Take me away  
Voices of love, here am I  
In the sad sad world of fear  
Take me away  
From the power of my ambition  
And I'll be happy  
  
I, I've conquered time  
Where will I go?  
Am I still mine?  
Take me away  
  
To the furthest star in the sky  
Take me away  
To the deepest cave of the night  
Take me away  
Voices of love, here am I  
In the sad sad world of fear  
Take me away  
From the power of my ambition  
And I'll be happy  
  
Peace, floating in limbo  
Limbo, leading me nowhere  
Peace, now without motion  
I cry, when will I die?  
God, where is my soul now?  
My world, please set me free
