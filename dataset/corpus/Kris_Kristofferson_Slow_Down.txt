I said slow down  
Slow down and live, my friend  
Take time, take time to understand  
The things, the things you hope to win  
Before, before your journey's end  
Slow down, slow down and try to do  
The things, the things that's right for you  
  
You know, you know  
The soul, the soul  
You save could be your own  
  
Albert Abernathy never spent a foolish dime  
Rising at the crack of dawn and working overtime  
You know, he never told me how much happiness he found  
Yesterday we laid him in the finest grave in town.  
  
I said slow down  
Slow down and live, my friend  
Take time, take time to understand  
The things, the things you hope to win  
Before, before your journey's end.  
  
Slow down, slow down and try to do  
The things, the things that's right for you  
You know, you know  
The soul, the soul  
You save could be your own.  
  
Little Sally Tremble is a Music City Queen  
You can see her picture now on every magazine  
Sally's come a long way from the life she left behind  
She's had six gold records and been married seven times!  
  
I said slow down--slow down and live my friend  
Take time, take time to understand  
The things, the things you hope to win  
Before, before your journey's end  
Slow down, slow down and try to do  
The things, the things that's right for you  
  
You know, you know  
The soul, the soul  
You save could be your own.
