The sun will rise  
Our golden prize  
No shadow fall  
Upon our lives  
The sands of time  
Won't fall for us  
No ash to ash, no dust to dust  
Eternal summer waits for us  
Our bodies bronze, we thirst, we lust  
The changes of the years, won't touch us- no!  
  
[Chorus:]  
We are eternal  
We are young, we are strong  
We are immortal, the life force is in our hands  
On we go through seas of time  
We hear the voive, we drink the wine  
I build, you burn, then one forgets  
The evils of the innocent  
A face of wonder, a heart will cry  
The stain of death upon her eyes  
A moment caught in time  
I'm alive!  
  
[Chorus]  
We are eternal  
We are immortal  
We are the flame that never dies!  
We are eternal  
We are immortal  
We'll never die!
