Billy's got a gun, he's on the run  
Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind  
Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's gonna shoot ya down  
He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise  
There's danger in the air  
  
Can you feel it in the air?  
Danger (Such a strange emotion)  
Can you feel it in the air?  
  
Oh he was locked inside a room without a door  
His innocence he suffered for  
In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right  
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true  
He's going underground to track that danger down  
Oh Billy, why you got that gun?  
  
Never give him an even break  
Gettin' caught is the chance you take  
It could be your last mistake  
(You could be so helpless)  
As a bird with a broken wing  
Like a sheep in a lion's den  
Gonna fall but you won't know when  
  
You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall  
And the ghastly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall  
Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late  
  
As the rain came down on the crimson ground  
It was the hand of fate  
And a crowd of people gathered round, but Billy couldn't wait
