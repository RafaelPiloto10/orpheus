"Kiss my ass!" I said  
and I threw my drink  
Tequila trickling  
Down his business suit  
Must be the Irish blood  
Fight before you think  
Turn it now  
You can't cowtow  
You can't undo it  
It's his town  
And that went down  
Like a lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
He said "Sic her, Rover"  
That went over  
Like a lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon  
  
An angry man is just an angry man  
But an angry woman  
Bitch!  
I had to ask him for a helping hand  
It came with the heart  
Of a Bonaparte  
Of a frozen fish  
It's his town  
And that went down  
Like a lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
He said "Sic her, Rover"  
That went over  
Like a lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon  
  
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon  
  
It's his town  
and that went down  
Like a lead balloon  
Lead lead lead balloon  
He said "Sic her, Rover"  
That went over  
Like a lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead lead lead lead balloon  
Lead balloon
