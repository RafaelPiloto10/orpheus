I'm thinking 'bout moving in,  
Commit myself to you, forget where I've been,  
I'm thinking thinking 'bout moving in,  
I'm thinking 'bout making my stand,  
And I know I could do it,  
If you give me your hand,  
I'm thinking 'bout making my stand  
Making my stand,  
You changed my world,  
And you stood in my doorway,  
You changed my life,  
When you stepped into my mind,  
Used to think that there was no future before me,  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Behind  
Don't understand why you do what you do  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
Used to think that there was no future before me,  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Now you say that I can leave my past behind  
Behind  
Don't understand why you do what you do  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
You keep giving your love,  
We give nothing to you,  
  
Here I am thinking 'bout moving in,  
Making my stand,  
Here I am thinking 'bout moving in,  
Making my stand.
