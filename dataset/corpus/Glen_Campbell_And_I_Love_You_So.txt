And I love you so, the people ask me how  
How I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know  
I guess, they understand, how lonely life it's been  
But life began again the day you took my hand  
And yes, I've known, how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evenin' get me down  
Now that you're around me  
And you love me too, your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free, I'm happy that you do  
The book of life is brief and watch the pages with  
All but love is there, that is my belief  
And yes, I've known, how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I won't let the evenin' get me down  
As long as you're around me
