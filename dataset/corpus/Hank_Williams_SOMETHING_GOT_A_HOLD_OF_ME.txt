At first when I heard of some people who claim  
That the old-time religion was real  
I said "I'll go down, take a look at the crowd  
For just that weak-minded I feel."  
  
I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door  
But the devil said, "don't you go in!"  
But I said, "it won't hurt me I'll just step inside  
And I'll set as far back as I can." (but-)  
  
[Chorus]  
Something got a hold of me (praise god)  
Yes something got a hold of me (oh! lord)  
I went there to fight, but I'll tell you that night  
God certainly got a hold of me.  
  
They sang like they meant it, they all clapped their hands  
I said, "it's commotion, that's all."  
"when they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave  
For I don't wanta be seen here at all."  
  
But I bowed that time, he got started to preach  
And he looked straight down at me  
He told ev'rybody how mean that I was  
He didn't talk like he thought much of me.  
  
I sat in my seat just thinkin' it o'er  
And then they all started to pray  
The fire fell from heaven, I fell to the floor  
I prayed there and God had his way. (for-)  
  
[Chorus]
