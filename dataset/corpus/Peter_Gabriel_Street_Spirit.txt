Rows of houses all bearing down on me  
I can feel their blue hands touching me  
All these things in all positions  
All these things will one day take control  
And fade out again and fade out  
  
This machine will will not communicate these thoughts  
And the strain I am under  
Be a world child form a circle before we all go under  
And fade out again and fade out again  
  
Cracked eggs dead birds  
Scream as they fight for life  
I can feel death can see it's beady eyes  
All these things into fruition  
All these things we'll one day swallow whole  
And fade out again and fade out again.
