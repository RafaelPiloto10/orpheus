[Sebastien:]  
A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
  
[Urs:]  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn',  
This comes to pass when a child is born.  
  
[Carlos:]  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
  
[David:]  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn,  
This comes to pass when a child is born.  
  
It's all a dream, an illusion now.  
It must come true some time soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn',  
This comes to pass when a child is born.  
When a child is born.
