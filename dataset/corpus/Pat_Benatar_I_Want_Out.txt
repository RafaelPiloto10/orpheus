Ooh baby, got a hold on me, I can't deny it  
You locked the door and you swallowed the key  
And I... and I kept quiet  
Yeah baby, got a hold on me, I didn't want to be alone  
I stayed with you 'cause I really believed  
That I couldn't make it on my own  
  
But I'm getting a little bit smarter  
Gettin' tired of playin' the martyr  
And I know what you're all about  
I Want Out!  
I Want Out!  
  
Ooh baby, your lovin' told on me, I couldn't smile anymore  
My friends all told me, baby can't you see?  
But I wasn't seeing clear before  
  
Now I'm getting a little bit smarter  
Gettin' tired of playin' the martyr  
And I know what you're all about  
I Want Out!  
I Want Out!  
  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me, I didn't want to be alone  
I stayed with you 'cause I really believed  
That I couldn't make it  
I Want Out!  
  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!  
Ooh baby, got a hold on me  
I Want Out!
