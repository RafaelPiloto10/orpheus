Are you an illusion that I've kissed?  
Am I only dreaming you exist?  
Am I just pretending dreams come true?  
And is heaven wise opening my eyes  
To someone like you?  
  
Are you an illusion I embrace?  
Can you be the rainbow that I chase?  
Want you in this yearning that I feel  
Tell me that it's so, what I want to know  
Tell me that you're real  
  
Are you an illusion I embrace?  
Can you be the rainbow that I chase?  
Want you in this yearning that I feel  
Tell me that it's so, what I want to know  
Tell me that you're real
