Shine I'll stand by you  
Don't try and push me away  
'Cause I'm just gonna stay  
You can shine I won't deny you  
And don't be afraid it'll all be ok  
  
Do you know my name  
Well I ain't gonna take  
That big time line  
Won't be beat by a lie  
Gonna call out to these embers  
Waiting to ignite  
Gonna pull you up  
By your love, by your love  
And tell you  
  
Shine I'll stand by you...  
  
I can see the frown you wear  
All around like some faded crown  
Like a watch over wound  
Gonna call down to this diamond  
Buried underground  
Gonna pull you up  
By your love, by your love  
And tell you  
  
When it's said and done  
What you need will come  
And time won't let me  
Let you let me waste it this time  
Shine...
