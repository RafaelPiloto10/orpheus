Cover up  
With loving protection  
Guard your love  
In every direction  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Run away my sister and brother  
Be afraid of love when the lover  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Tries to read the book by the cover  
Wrapped up in the arms of another  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Cover up prolonging the yearning  
Just ahead the fires are burning VERSE 2  
Swim for shore the tides are now turning  
Love the ones you love with your learning  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Look ahead the futures depending  
On the brave to now start defending VERSE 3  
Tell the world the message you're sending  
We don't need an unhappy ending  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
Got to be safe if you want to be free BRIDGE  
To sit in the shade of the family tree  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Tries to read the book by the cover  
Wrapped up in the arms of another  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
Got to be safe if you want to be free  
To sit in the shade of the family tree
