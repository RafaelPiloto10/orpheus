My eyes are aching from the weight on them  
The pain of living is such a bore  
To make you happy I must bend for you  
But I can't take it anymore.  
  
And all the morning birds may laugh at me  
But they've got the same straight jobs to do  
And I can't see who is the biggest fool of all  
With my eyes all scarred from a whiskey night.  
  
I stumbled around with my eyes half closed  
And curse the sun for being so bright  
I hold you close, feel your warmth and wonder why  
The river of life for you runs right.  
  
And all the morning birds may laugh at me  
But they've got the same straight jobs to do  
And I can't see who is the biggest fool of all  
With my eyes all scarred from a whiskey night.  
  
My head is poundin' as I'm sittin' here  
And my mind's not workin' like it should  
Come on, guitar, you've got to save me  
And get me back feelin' like I should.
