[Verse 1]  
You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time  
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together, you'll be fine  
Tell me, what the hell do you know? What do you know?  
Tell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
'Til It happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels  
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real  
No, it won't be real, won't know how it feels  
  
[Verse 2]  
You tell me hold your head up, hold your head up and be strong  
Cause when you fall you gotta get up, you gotta get up and move on  
Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?  
Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke  
  
[Chorus 2]  
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels  
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
No it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
Won't know how I feel  
  
[Bridge]  
'Til your world burns and crashes  
'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope  
'Til you're standing in my shoes  
I don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you  
Cause you don't know  
  
[Chorus 3]  
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how I feel, how I feel  
How I feel  
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
No it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
Won't know how it feels  
  
[Outro]  
Til it happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
(How could you know?)  
Til it happens you  
You won't know how I feel
