I ain't livin' here no more, I ain't even keepin' score  
It's too late to change, it's over, I'm drownin' in a sea of tears  
Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference  
There ain't nothin' I can do, none of it's makin' sense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you, standing on the outside  
Standing on the outside, I'm running out of time, standing on the outside  
  
I'm so tired of bein' alone in a world that feels so cold  
There's got to be a light that I can find  
There's got to be a soul somewhere that shines for me  
  
Now I don't want to live without love anymore, I just want to live my life  
Love's gonna open up the door, show me it's light again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference  
There ain't nothin' I can do, none of it's makin' sense  
  
Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you, standing on the outside  
Standing on the outside, what can I do, standing on the outside  
Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you  
Standing on the outside, yes I'm lookin' in at you  
Standing on the outside, I'm lookin' in at you
