Are you ever so silent, when she wanted to talk?  
Or couldn't keep quiet, when she needed a hug  
Come on too strong, when a little's too much  
How many, how many, say I  
Go on and say yes, and really mean no  
Would you rather guess, when you just don't know  
And then say I love you, but aren't willing to show  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
  
Say live and let live, so quick to judge  
Slow to forgive, when you're holding a grudge  
Don't always believe, all you need is love  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
  
Have you ever looked down when the homeless walked by?  
Or changed the channel when you saw a hungry child?  
Know something to be true, then deny it  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I
