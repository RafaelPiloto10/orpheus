For them there were no presents  
Around the Christmas tree  
No flashing lights unless you count  
The lamp across the street  
A fire in a barrel  
No chimney and no roof  
To most of them Santa Claus  
Was the man who made the soup  
  
In an alley was a mother  
Two children by her side  
Trying hard to keep the spark  
Of true Christmas alive  
She said we may not have some things  
That other people do  
But Christmas is for everyone  
And were Gods children too  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
I don't think Santa's comin'  
Cause he don't know where we live  
But who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
  
Well early Christmas morning  
While they were still asleep  
I packed a box of food and clothes  
And walked back to their street  
Imagine my surprise  
When I saw presents all around  
Blankets, toys and winter coats  
Beside them on the ground  
And the card I read from Santa said  
Inside the three of you  
The real heart of Christmas  
Is still beating strong and true  
  
Oh and Jesus loves you  
And so do I  
Think about the baby  
And the star up in the sky  
Santa Claus is comin  
Cause he know where real faith lives  
But who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
Who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift  
Who needs Christmas presents  
We already have the gift
