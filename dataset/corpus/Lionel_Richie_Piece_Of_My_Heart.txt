How could this happen, I don't understand  
Falling in love was just not in my plan  
But I want you to know,  
You just got a piece of my heart  
I've been through the changes  
I've walked through the pain  
I've told myself I would never do this again  
But I want you to know,  
You just got a piece of my heart  
'Cause love has been a stranger,  
Love has been cruel  
Lovin's made me feel like the world's one and only fool  
And I promised myself I would never trust my heart again  
I protected my feelings  
I fought to be free  
I can't believe I would let this happen to me  
But I want you to know  
You just got a piece of my heart  
Tell me where did you come from  
Tell me who sent you here  
Whatever the reason, girl God made the message clear  
'Cause nobody else can make me feel the way that you do  
I just gotta say  
That the struggle is over  
My story's true, I finally realized  
I want to spend my life with you  
'Cause you are the one that changed the way I feel  
And I swear I know this time it's real  
Never in my lifetime, in my wildest dreams  
Could I ever ever imagine the love that you brought to me  
'Cause you are the one that changed the way I feel  
How could this happen, I don't understand  
Falling in love was just not in my plan  
But I want you to know,  
You just got a piece of my heart  
But I want you to know,  
You just got a piece of my heart  
Just got a piece of my heart
