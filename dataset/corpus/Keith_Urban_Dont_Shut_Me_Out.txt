Don't shut me out maybe baby  
We should talk about it  
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby  
They might be unfounded  
  
Have a little faith you'll make it through  
I'd never hesitate to talk to you  
If you tell me just what's weighing on your mind  
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight  
So don't shut me out  
  
Don't be so proud don't ya know that  
Before a fall it leaves ya  
And it'll take you down baby that ain't  
Where I want to see ya  
  
The sun'll rise tomorrow come what may  
And you'll feel better than you do today  
And in time you'll cry no more  
I know 'cause my heart's been there before  
  
And here I am when you need someone  
My shoulder's yours to cry upon  
And everybody now and then  
Needs and understanding friend around  
So don't shut me out  
  
Don't shut me out maybe baby  
We should talk about it  
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby  
They might be unfounded  
Listen to your heart and clear your mind  
And you will find the answer every time  
Every road you travel on will lead  
To where it is your heart's supposed to be  
  
And here I am when you need someone  
My shoulder is yours to cry upon  
And everybody now and then  
Needs an understandin' friend around  
So don't shut me out, don't shut me out, don't shut me out
