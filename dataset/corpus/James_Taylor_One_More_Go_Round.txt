Workin' on a thing, workin' on a thing,  
Funny little thing I know,  
Sure got to like it.  
Only thing I got to show you,  
Running around the room  
In my Fruit O' The Loom,  
A cup of coffee from King Tut's tomb.  
Save me, Lumalammalu  
Sure enough I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus  
To miss the first half of the show.  
Oh, It gets to the end,  
We get to run it again  
Just like before,  
One more go round.  
  
Drank myself some wine back in '69,  
I was fooling around with my friends  
In my spare time.  
Life along the river,  
Knobby little knees in the Summer breeze,  
Hammock and a couple of trees,  
Swing low, if you please.  
Oh, I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus,  
I missed the whole half of the show.  
Come to the end  
And they run it again,  
Same as before,  
One more go round.  
  
After all this time of fooling around  
It and never having nothing to show,  
Yeah, I'm happy to say  
That I finally found it  
Right underneath my own nose.  
Oh, I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus,  
I missed the first half of the show.  
Please don't let it end,  
I want it again  
Just like before,  
One more go round.
