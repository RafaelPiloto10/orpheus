You could've bowed down gracefully  
But you didn't  
You knew enough to know  
To leave well enough alone  
  
But you wouldn't  
I drive myself crazy  
Tryin' to stay out of my own way  
The messes that I make  
  
But my secrets are so safe  
The only one who gets me  
Yeah, you get me  
It's amazing to me  
  
[Chorus]  
How every day  
Every day, every day  
You save my life  
  
I come around all broken down and  
Crowded out  
And you're comfort  
Sometimes the place I go  
Is so deep and dark and desperate  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I swear, I don't know if  
I'm comin' or goin'  
But you always say something  
Without even knowin'  
  
That I'm hangin' on to your words  
With all of my might and it's alright  
Yeah, I'm alright for one more night-  
Every day  
  
Every day, every day, every day  
Every day, every day  
You save me, you save me, oh, oh, oh  
Every day  
Every, every, every day-  
  
Every day you save my life
