Listen to the rain a-fallin'  
Can't you hear that lonesome sound  
Oh my poor old heart is breakin'  
'Cause my sweet love ain't round  
Lord I think I'll start to ramble  
Got to leave this weary town  
This old place is way too lonely  
'Cause my sweet love ain't around  
On that train tonight I'm leavin'  
And don't ask me where I'm bound  
I can't stay here any longer  
'Cause my sweet love ain't around
