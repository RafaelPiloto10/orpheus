These lips were made for kissing  
These hips were made fro blissing.  
These arms were made for squeezing you tight  
Everyday, olay everynight!  
  
These lips were made for selecting  
These hips were made for connecting  
These legs were made for wrapping around you  
So tight, olay everynight!  
  
When you see my dancing on the floor  
You'll agree I'm class to the core  
When you see me dancing with the boys  
You'll agree you've never seen such poise.  
  
These lips were made for tasting my time  
Weren't made for wasting so I'm  
Gonna show you how it's done  
Just for fun, anyone wanna come.  
  
These lips were made for kissing  
Take a sip and you'll know what you've been missing  
You'll flip when you see this tamale wants to make you stay  
Everyday, olay everynight!  
  
What'd you say, everyday, olay everynight  
We can play everyday, olay everynight, well alright!
