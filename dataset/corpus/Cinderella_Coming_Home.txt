I took a walk down a road it's the road I was meant to stay  
I see the fire in your eyes but a man's gott make his way  
  
[Chorus]  
So are you tough enough for my love  
Just close your eyes to the heaven above  
I'm comin home, I'm comin home  
  
I took a ride in a world I'll be spinnin for the rest of my life  
I feel your heart beating baby  
Ooh sometimes it cuts like a knife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm coming home where your love tonight can shine on me  
I'm coming home where your loving arms can set me free  
  
I took a walk down a road it's the road I was meant to stay  
I see the fire in your eyes but a man's gotta make his way  
  
[Chorus]
