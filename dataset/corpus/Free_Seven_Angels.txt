If you see me flyin'  
all across the sky  
there I go, I'm flyin' high.  
  
Six white horses  
a chariot made of gold  
seven lovely angels  
abide my soul  
  
I've got the moon on my right  
the sun on my left  
the world is behind me  
only one way to go  
that's straight ahead  
that's where I'm going.  
  
  
Well I've just stepped out  
out of my grave  
there I go, I ain't no slave  
in my right hand  
is the sword of truth  
in my left hand  
is the fire of love  
I call to the land  
I call to the sea  
I call to the sky  
Lord have mercy  
won't you hear me  
  
As I look behind me  
what do I see  
a pair of golden wings  
seems to be attached to me  
  
Wings on my back, I've got to fly away  
I just can't wait till tomorrow  
I've got to fly away  
There I go. 1
