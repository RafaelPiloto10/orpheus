Why can't you admit  
You've done of what's you've told  
Like the dog waiting for the bone  
You greed, can't you, just tell the truth  
You did what you have to,  
And so you decided to sold me, out (for the money)  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you  
  
Close your eyes and count to the ten,  
This won't take a long, just a few seconds (left ahead)  
It doesn't hurt so much either, I'll promise it  
(From all my heart, why would I lie to you my friend)  
  
The pain you made, the pressure you gave  
I held it all, inside of me 'til I past  
Now I shall salute you, the assassin of 2012  
Are you clapping your hands together, that's what I assume  
  
Tonight you'll suffer with the endless pain,  
Dying while dreaming of my forgiveness,  
So this time, I feel like I win  
  
You should just left me on my own  
And take those steps back before you told  
That you can be trusted but seems like you don't  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you  
  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, doesn't it hurt and yeah, I love you.
