We're millionaires  
Against hunger  
  
I'm a millionaire  
And I got something to say  
I got a million more that'll take me away  
All those people starvin' everyday  
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay  
  
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you  
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do  
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day  
I've got to make it better, I've got to say  
You and I, we're millionaires,  
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares  
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week  
Just because they can't get enough to eat  
While we the rich dine on all these feasts,  
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme  
But it just isn't something you've got to realize,  
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes  
When the world cries, we just can't hide,  
E've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives  
  
We're millionaires  
Against hunger  
  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
Twice as nice when you share  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
A spiritual price do you care  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
Nice and Wise when you share  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
Pave the way, take the Grail  
  
I'm a millionaire  
And I got something to say  
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay  
All those people starvin' everyday  
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay  
  
Well I'm a millionaire too  
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use  
I want anything that I can have,  
But I don't need nothin' and I never have  
Each damn day my heart's set far,  
But I'll be okay, 'cause I don't starve  
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch  
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night,  
You know it gives to share  
So listen up, you millionaires,  
Every woman, every man, help all you can  
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us
learn  
  
We're millionaires  
Against hunger  
  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
Twice as nice when you share  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
A spiritual price do you care  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
Nice and wise when you share  
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire  
Pave the way, take the Grail
