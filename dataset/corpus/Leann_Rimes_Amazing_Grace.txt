Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me.  
I once was lost but now I'm found.  
Was blind but now I see.  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved.  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed.  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Then when we first begun.  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me.  
I once was lost, but now I'm found.  
Was blind, but now I see
