This is a mans world, this is a mans world  
But it wouldnt be nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
You know man made a car to take us over the road  
Man made the train to carry heavy loads  
Man made electric lights to take us out of the dark  
Man made a boat for the water just like noah made the ark  
  
Think about a little baby girl and a little baby boy  
Man makes then happy cause man makes them toys  
And after man has made everything, everything in the world he can  
Man makes money to buy some other man
