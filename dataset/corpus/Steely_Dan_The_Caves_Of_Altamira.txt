I recall when I was small  
How I spent my days alone  
The busy world was not for me  
So I went and found my own  
I would climb the garden wall  
With a candle in my hand  
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand  
On the stone an ancient hand  
In a faded yellow-green  
Made alive a worldly wonder  
Often told but never seen  
Now and ever bound to labor  
On the sea and in the sky  
Every man and beast appeared  
A friend as real as I  
  
[Chorus]  
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall  
When there wasn't even any Hollywood  
They heard the call  
And they wrote it on the wall  
For you and me we understood  
  
Can it be this sad design  
Could be the very same  
A wooly man without a face  
And a beast without a name  
Nothin' here but history  
Can you see what has been done  
Memory rush over me  
Now I step into the sun  
  
[Chorus]
