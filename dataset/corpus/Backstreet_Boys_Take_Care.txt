I, I've waited all my life  
To step out from the light  
And see the shadows fading.  
You, you've always stood so tall  
I've never thought you'd fall,  
  
But now it's you that's fading!  
Pre-Chorus:  
I know that inside you're delicate  
But you say that  
You don't need someone to take care of you, but  
Chorus:  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Oh, oh, oh so you want, there's no need to want  
Stand up face to face the stage  
Up high, but we'll reach higher!  
I will tell the soul if you cry  
I can hold you, why you're crying now?  
Pre-Chorus:  
I know that inside you're delicate  
But you say that  
You don't need someone to take care of you, but  
Chorus:  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Take care of you!  
I know that inside you're delicate  
And, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
Baby, baby, baby  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Take care of you!
