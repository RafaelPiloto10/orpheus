Then I saw your face  
Suddenly I'm losing faith, yea  
The words are few to place  
Give up, give out, giving no big disgrace, yea  
  
Let's stop wasting time  
Let's stop wasting time  
  
Say your mind  
But you can tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Let's stop wasting time  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
  
Let me in your heart  
Give up, give out, giving is where it starts, yea  
Dreaming's not so hard  
Once you've found your shooting star, yea  
  
Let's stop wasting time  
Let's stop wasting time  
  
Say your mind  
But you can tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Let's stop wasting time  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
  
Oh, yea  
  
Tell me if I'm in, in over my head  
Tell me if our future is just hanging by a thread  
I don't want to begin something I can't face  
If I'm destined for loneliness tell me on my way  
On my way  
  
Tell me I'm out of my head  
Tell me I'm out of my head  
No, don'tcha tell me I'm out of my head  
I'm out of my head  
  
  
Oh, Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Let's stop wasting time  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Quit playing with my mind  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head  
  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
Don't tell me I'm out of my head  
I feel like I'm losing my head  
Won't you tell me I'm out of my head
