Hello  
  
(Conway)  
Hello Loretta  
  
(Loretta)  
Darlin', I knew it was you  
Oh, please tell me what to do  
You gave me the will to go on  
As soon as I picked up the phone.  
  
The talk, is around that we're through  
Oh darlin, tell me what to do  
I knew that you'd tell me, they where wrong  
As soon as I picked up the phone.  
  
Oh no, Oh no  
I can't believe that it's true  
Oh no, Oh no  
I can't believe that we're through  
You tell me it's over and done  
You say that you had all your fun  
But I can't believe you'll be gone  
As soon as I hang up the phone.  
  
As soon as I hang up the phone.  
  
(Conway)  
Goodbye Loretta...
