I sent a message to another time,  
But as the days unwind, this I just can't believe,  
I send a note across another plane,  
Maybe it's all a game, but this I just can't conceive  
  
I drive the very latest Hover car,  
I don't know where you are  
But I miss you so much till then,  
I met someone who looks a lot like you,  
She does the things you do, but she is an IBM  
  
She's only programmed to be very nice,  
But she's as cold as ice, whenever I get too near,  
She tells me that she likes me very much,  
But when I try to touch, she makes it all too clear.  
  
She is the latest in technology,  
Almost mythology, but she has a heart of stone,  
She has an IQ of 1, 001,  
She has a jump suit on, and she's also a telephone.  
  
Chorus  
  
Is that what you want - is it what you really want.  
  
I realize that it must seem to strange,  
That time has rearranged, but time has the final word  
She knows I think of you, she reads my mind,  
She tries to be unkind, she knows nothing of your world  
  
Although her memory banks overflow  
No one would ever know, all she says, "Is that what you want?"  
Maybe one day I'll feel her cold embrace,  
And kiss her interface, until then I'll leave her alone.  
  
Chorus
