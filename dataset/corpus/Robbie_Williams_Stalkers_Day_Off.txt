I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
'cause I understand you see  
  
I was concerned when you're sad  
You'd rather wake up dead to spend a day with me  
I know that's not you I know and it's true  
They don't understand you like I do  
  
I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
'cause I understand you see  
  
Hi! It's me again  
Yeah I got out on parole  
Yeah erm erm you can just er pick up the phone  
'd like to talk to you please  
  
I've seen misery and have a strange empathy  
With a woman who kidnaps her lover  
This love ain't a dream I know it's obscene  
The calls that I left for your mother  
  
I've been hanging around just in case you fall in love with me  
I know you have doubts I hear when you shout  
'cause I understand you see  
  
I love you too And erm perhaps one day we can meet  
Face to face this time  
Ha! I'm sorry about that letter I sent you  
The newspaper cuttings and stuffs and blood ha
