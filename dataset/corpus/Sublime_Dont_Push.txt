Stolen from an Africa land  
Chased out with a knife  
With a face like Bob Marley and a mouth like a motor bike  
Oh well the bars are always open and the time is always right  
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
If I was Bob Marley I said could you be loved  
If I was Half Pint I'd ball the lord up above  
If I was Mike Tyson I'd look for a fight  
If I was a Boomtown Rats I would be stayin' up all night  
If I was the King Ad-Rock I would get stupid dumb  
If rhymes were Valiums I'd be comfortably numb  
  
If I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do,  
I'd point that shit straight at the sky  
And shoot heaven on down for you  
Because the bars are always open, and the time is always right  
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
I want a lover, I can't find the time  
I want a reason, I can't find the rhyme  
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford,  
Just lay on the ground like I fell off my skateboard  
Now a days, as clear as you please, strap with protection or strap with
disease.  
Laughter, it's free any time just call me  
439-0116 when your down with Sublime you get  
Funky fresh lyrics, you get nothin'  
  
Stolen from an Africa land  
Got chased out of the bar  
I saw my best friend tonight, so don't push me too far  
  
I'm gonna run come down with the new lyrics,  
Get hit get hip don't slip you knuckle heads  
Racism is schism on a serious tip  
You don't believe me that I won't bust your lip.  
I hear the mountain, it hard to climb  
Ruffle the rhythm and it must be Sublime  
Listen yellow lover yeah it right on time  
We got cricket with the quickness and the bass line  
  
Go and raid the sound and tell the people the news oh, hey  
Tell them reggae music is on the loose  
Here I am from the place where the sun keeps shine new style in a unique
fashion  
And good, good vibes that keep on playin', playin'  
  
People want to come up and they want to tell me smokin' crack cocaine better
than sensi  
You're pumpin' that shit yo we're sick of it  
Teakin' every weekend and we just can't take it  
We don't want plastic
