Well, September comes around like an old familiar friend  
So I take off to Central Park to watch those falling leaves again  
And in the arbors of Strawberry Fields, in a night as bright as day  
I look up at the sky and wish I could fly away  
And I say I know this life won't last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
I'm with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you, I'll always be your man  
And so I watch those falling leaves until the winter kicks in good  
Until I reach the same conclusion, we never say the things we should  
You're with me all the time it seems, yeah, these days I'm not alone  
I can't explain the things I'm going through, it's you not me that's flown
away  
And I say I know this time won't last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
I'm with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you, I'll always be your man  
And time has put us through some heavy changes  
And I say I still care about you and I know what love's for  
And I'll be right here waiting for you every day  
To come in laughing through that door  
Look up at the towers through the falling snow  
It's hard to tell what you've been going through  
Because I'm a stranger now in your world  
And I say I know this world won't last forever  
But wherever you go these days  
I'm with you all the way  
And I say I know your time and mine together  
Is more than I could understand  
But I promise you, I'll always be your man  
Day in day out, I have no doubt  
I'll always be your man
