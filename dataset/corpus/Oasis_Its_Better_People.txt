It's better people, love one another  
'Cause livin' your life can be tough  
It's better people, speak to each other  
Your shame is not enough  
  
If everybody came alive  
And stayed alive  
And lived their lives instead, yeah  
So come outside  
And feel the light  
It's cold inside  
But it's lonely in your bed, in your bed  
  
And you though we might be  
But what you heard before  
Was only sleepin' in your brain  
But if you came with me  
The days'd never end  
Would never be the same  
They'd never be the same  
They'd never be the same  
Never be the same

This is goin by a different name  
They'd never be the same
