Sitting in my easy chair  
I got no friends but I really don't care  
I don't remember birthdays  
I don't remember names  
People talk to me  
I know not what they say  
Well my political policy is laissez-faire  
You keep off my thoroughfare  
My weeds grow like roses  
My gardens like greed  
My temples are discotheques for refugees  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's all about me  
On my very own Planet Z  
Where I'm lonely, but I'm free  
Nothing gets in my way  
I think I'm gonna have to stay right here  
[Repeat]  
  
Well my pizza delivery guys, they all wear suits  
And all my musicians, they play in the nude  
The lawyers wear nipple rings  
They kiss my ass  
And the french horn players are  
In the most demand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Planet Z  
You can't predict the weather  
But it's fine with me  
Can't you see  
I don't like when you bother me  
Planet Z  
The stars are brighter in my galaxy  
Thirteen moons revolve around, around, around...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well these lovely little snowflakes are everywhere  
They're the spitballs that you blow in my hair  
Well I won't remember your birthday  
I won't remember your name  
Just keep talking to me  
I'm not listening  
  
[Chorus]
