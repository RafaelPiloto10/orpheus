I don't lose my blues  
When I pretend you're with me  
Though I make believe  
I'm still alone  
When I think of you  
My empty arms remind me  
That my one true love has gone  
  
I was a fool, that's why I cried over you  
I was a fool, I only wanted you  
  
When I smile so gay, everybody knows  
That I've lost my love  
But that's the way it goes  
When I think of you  
My empty arms remind me  
That my one true love has gone  
  
I was a fool, that's why I cried over you  
I was a fool, I only wanted you
