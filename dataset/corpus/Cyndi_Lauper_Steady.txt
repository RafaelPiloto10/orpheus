Friends they call me  
On the phone  
'cause I'm steady  
Talk about unhappy homes  
'cause I'm steady  
Though I don't like to let it show  
I got troubles of my own  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
  
Day to day is so unsure  
But I'm steady  
I watch people crash and soar  
But I'm steady  
The more they try  
So hard to change  
The more they stay the same  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
  
We're faced with so much  
Back and forth  
I don't need no ups and downs  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
I'm steady  
I'm steady
