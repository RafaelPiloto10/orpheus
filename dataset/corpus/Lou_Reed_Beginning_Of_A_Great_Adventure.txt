It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around  
a little me to fill up with my thoughts  
A little me or he or she to fill up with my dreams  
a way of saying life is not a loss  
  
I'd keep the tyke away from school and tutor him myself  
keep him from the poison of the crowd  
But then again pristine isolation might not be the best idea  
it's not good trying to immortalize yourself  
  
Beginning of a great adventure  
Beginning of a great adventure  
  
Why stop at one, I might have ten, a regular TV brood  
I'd breed a little liberal army in the wood  
Just like these redneck lunatics I see at the local bar  
with their tribe of mutant inbred piglets with cloven hooves  
  
I'd teach 'em how to plant a bomb, start a fire, play guitar  
and if they catch a hunter, shoot him in the nuts  
I'd try to be as progressive as I could possibly be  
as long as I don't have to try too much  
  
Beginning of a great adventure  
Beginning of a great adventure  
  
Susie, Jesus, Bogart, Sam, Leslie, Jill and Jeff  
Rita, Winny, Andy, Fran and Jet  
Boris, Bono, Lucy, Ethel, Bunny, Reg and Tom  
that's a lot of names to try not to forget  
  
Carrie, Marlon, Mo and Steve, La Rue and Jerry Lee  
Eggplant, Rufus, Dummy, Star and The Glob  
I'd need a damn computer to keep track of all these names  
I hope this baby thing don't go too far  
  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me, hey  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
  
She says, "Baby, it's the beginning of a great adventure"  
"Babe, beginning of a great adventure"  
take a look  
  
It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around  
create in my own image like a god  
I'd raise my own pallbearers to carry me to my grave  
and keep me company when I'm a wizened toothless clod  
  
Some gibbering old fool sitting all alone drooling on his shirt  
some senile old fart playing in the dirt  
It might be fun to have a kid I could pass something on to  
something better than rage, pain, anger and hurt  
  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
She says, "Lou, it's the beginning of a great adventure"  
"Lou, Lou, Lou, beginning of a great adventure"  
She says, "babe, how you call your lover boy"  
"Sylvia, quite you call your lover man"
