Close your eyes  
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep  
Close your eyes  
And I will close mine  
Close your eyes  
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep  
Close your eyes  
Oh this is divine  
Music play something dreamy for dancing  
While we're here romancing it's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be near by your side  
So won't you close your eyes
