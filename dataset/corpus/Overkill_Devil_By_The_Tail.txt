Oh to be the fire, I am just a man  
Oh to walk the wire, believing that I can  
And reach on down the you're throat  
To tear it out  
Find out what the beating's all about  
  
[Chorus]  
Justify my envy  
Jealousy to fail  
In perfect, deadly, harmony  
hold the devil by the tail  
Devil, by the tail  
  
Oh to slay the liar, he speaks for me, a man  
Oh to try, conspire, believing that I can  
And reach into your heart  
To pull it out  
Find out what the beating's all about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run your devil up the pole  
Into my domain  
The forgotten drool, like rabid dogs  
By any other name  
They growl, they bark, they gnaw at me  
I still hear them wail  
Pray to hold what I hold  
A devil by the tail  
Devil, by the tail  
Run your devil, out your soul  
By another name  
Devil, by the tail  
Run your devil, take control  
Before we go insane  
Devil, devil  
  
Hey Mr. Lucifer, do you have my pay  
I'm done with working here as of today  
Hey Mr. Savior do you ever seem to fail  
And got what I got, a devil by the tail  
  
Devil by the tail, devil by the tail
