I'm a sucker for love  
All that's artificial  
Sometimes below  
The belt I hit you  
  
For without love  
Hell freezes over  
And wherever you go searching  
Know I'll want some  
  
Give me back my calling cards and vices  
My dignity and romance novels too  
  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
  
If you wanna know the truth  
I'm feeling open ended  
For without love  
I'm not tremendous  
  
The world we share  
It's not pretending  
And whenever you go AWOL  
Know I'll be there  
  
Give me back the photographs I sent you  
My residence and cool emotion too  
  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
  
You gotta ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now  
The love we have  
Is for the better now
