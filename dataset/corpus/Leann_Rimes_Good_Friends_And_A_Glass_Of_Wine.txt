I need a good friend  
  
Well who died and crowned me everybody's everything?  
I'm even busting my butt through the weekend  
By the time I get home there's not an ounce of sanity  
Between the dogs, my mama's calls, is it against the law  
For me to get what I need?  
  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
Someone to say it's going to be alright  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
A little pick me up to get me through the night  
We talk trash and we laugh and cry  
That kind of therapy, money can't buy  
Every now and then, every now and then  
Every girl needs  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
  
I don't need to jet off on no vacation for a week  
I'd be happy to have a happy hour  
When I'm tired and I'm fried  
It gets me right back on my feet  
Yeah, any kind red or white, a little sister time  
It's every smart girl's secret  
  
A good friend and glass of wine  
Someone to say it's going to be alright  
A good friend and glass of wine  
A little pick me up to get me through the night  
We talk trash and we laugh and cry  
That kind of therapy, money can't buy  
Every now and then, every now and then  
Every girl needs  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
Someone to say it's going to be alright  
A good friend and a glass of wine  
A little pick me up to get me through the night  
We talk trash and we laugh and cry  
That kind of therapy, money can't buy  
Every now and then, every now and then  
Every girl needs  
Every now and then, every now and then  
Ever girl needs  
A good friend and glass of wine  
  
Good friend and a glass of wine  
Don't you know that every girl needs  
A good friend and glass of wine
