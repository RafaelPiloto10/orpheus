I'm just a drifter  
I'll stay until you try to tie me down  
I'm not a quitter, baby  
I'd like to stay and see the whole thing go down.  
  
Don't try to tell me  
What I gotta do to fit  
Don't try to rescue me,  
I'm gonna go with my ship.  
  
What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?  
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?  
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?  
  
I like to drive my car  
If I've got someplace to go  
I like to feel the wheel  
Put down the top and let it roll.  
  
Don't try to fence me in,  
Don't try to slow me down  
Don't try to speed me up,  
Or tie my feet down to the ground.  
  
What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?  
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?  
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?  
  
I'm just a drifter  
I'll stay until you try to tie me down  
Don't try to rescue me,  
Don't try to rescue me  
I like to feel the wheel,  
I like to feel the wheel  
I like to feel the wheel.
