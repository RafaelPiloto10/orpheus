I had laid some mighty plans  
Thought I held them in my hands  
Then my world began to crumble all away I tried to build it back again  
I couldn't bear to see it end  
How I hurt to know You wanted it that way.  
(Chorus)  
And I'm so glad, glad to find the reason  
That I'm happy-sad that  
You've torn it all away  
And I'm so glad, though it hurts to know I'm leaving Everything I ever thought
that I would be  
Once I held it in my hand  
It was a kingdom made of sand  
But now you've blown it all away  
I can't believe that I can say that I'm glad.  
Long before my plans were made I know a master plan was laid  
With a power that superceded my control  
And if that truth could pierce my heart I wouldn't wander from the start
Trying desperately to make it on my own.  
(Chorus)
