Everything's blue in this world  
  
He couldn't believe how easy it was  
(he put the gun into his face)  
Bang!  
(so much blood for such a tiny little hole)  
Problems do have solutions you know  
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed  
In one determined flash  
  
Everything's blue  
Everything's blue in this world  
All fuzzy  
Spilling out of my head  
  
The deepest shade  
All spilling  
He couldn't believe how easy it was  
The deepest shade of mushroom blue  
Everything's blue in this world  
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed  
A lifetime of  
The deepest shade  
All fuzzy  
Spilling  
  
Bang!  
He couldn't believe how  
Bang!  
He couldn't believe how easy it was  
Bang!  
He couldn't believe  
Bang!  
The deepest shade of mushroom blue  
  
The deepest shade  
The deepest shade  
  
Bang!  
  
All fuzzy  
Spilling out of  
The deepest shade of mushroom blue  
  
The deepest shade of mushroom
