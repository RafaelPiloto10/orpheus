Hey all you people, for goodness sake,  
Let's get together, what does it take,  
To make you understand the value of a man?  
I'm talkin' about your son and neighbor, yes I am. oh ...  
  
Chorus  
People let's stop the war.  
People let's stop the war.  
People let's stop the war.  
People let's stop the war.  
  
If we had a president, that did just what he said,  
The country would be just alright, and no one would be dead,  
From fighting in a war, that causes big men to get rich.  
There's money in them war machines, now ain't this a bitch? oh ...  
  
Chorus  
  
I been excited, ain't nobody ready.  
They don't know what to get ready for.  
Let's get ready and stop the war.  
  
Ooo ... excited, ain't nobody ready.  
They don't know what to get ready for.  
Let's get ready and stop the war.  
  
I been excited, ain't nobody ready.  
They don't know what to get ready for.  
Let's get ready and stop the war.  
  
Ooo ... excited, ain't nobody ready.  
They don't know what to get ready for.  
Let's get ready and stop the war.  
  
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo-ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
