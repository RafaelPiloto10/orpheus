Baby, your eyes have that look  
And, baby, I put down my book  
And maybe, we won't be disturbed  
By a thing  
  
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring  
  
Oh, baby, I've got you alone  
And, baby, I'm not made of stone  
And maybe, we won't be disturned  
By a thing, this is too much  
  
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring  
  
Doesn't matter who's on the line  
When your lips are so close to mine  
Don't let anybody intrude on this mood  
We're incommunicado  
  
Baby, if someone should call  
Ignore it, do nothing at all  
Just kiss me, who knows what  
This moment may bring  
  
Just let it ring, let it ring  
Oh, let it ring
