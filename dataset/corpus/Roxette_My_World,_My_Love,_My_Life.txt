Some days are covered in rain  
while other days are made for glory  
And you are the summer sun  
The only one who knows the story  
  
Do you want to talk about it? - I don't know  
Do you want to say some words? - Oh, I can't let go  
I'm talking about my world, my love, my life  
Everytime I try to close my eyes  
you just enter my mind  
and you lay yourself down beside me... oh why?  
  
Some streets are covered with sweat  
there are no regrets just new connections... oh why?  
You are the Summer Son and i'm the one who wants affection  
  
Do you want to talk about it? - I don't know  
Do you want to speak some words? - Oh, I can't let go  
I'm talking about my world, my love, my life  
Everytime I try to close my eyes  
you just run through my head  
and you lay yourself down, beside me... oh why?  
  
My world, my life...  
  
I'm talking about my world, my love, my life  
Everytime... I try to close my eyes  
You just enter my mind  
and you lay yourself down, beside me... oh why...  
You just run through my head  
and you lay yourself down, beside me... oh why...  
  
My world, my life...
