Paradise  
Caught between the  
Fire and the ice  
No need to  
Think twice  
It's where I want  
To be  
Like a weather vane  
Following the  
Wind, the sun  
And rain  
The ecstasy  
And pain  
And all that  
Comes between  
Cause in the morning  
Summer breezes  
Will be coming  
My way  
Then in the evening  
Unbelieving  
I'll be ready to say  
That I am living  
Here in Paradise  
Balancing the  
Darkness with  
The light  
Silencing the fight  
Ahead is  
All I see  
Like a golden chain  
Wrapped around the  
Laughter  
And the pain  
Silencing the blame  
Let it all break free  
Then in the morning  
Summer breezes  
Will be coming  
My way  
And in the evening  
Unbelieving  
I'll be ready to say  
That we're all  
Living here in  
Paradise  
And though the sun  
Will fade away  
They say  
There's so  
Much more to  
Fill a day  
So be a  
Weather vane  
Following  
The wind,  
The sun,  
And rain  
The ecstasy  
And pain  
And all that  
Comes between  
Cause in the morning  
Summer breezes  
Will be coming  
Your way  
Then in the evening  
Unbelieving  
You'll be  
Ready to say  
That we're all  
Living here in  
Paradise  
In Paradise  
Paradise  
Living here in  
Paradise  
Between the  
Fire and the ice  
In Paradise  
Between the  
Fire and the ice  
in Paradise  
In Paradise  
In Paradise  
In Paradise
