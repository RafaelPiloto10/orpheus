Been thinkin' all day  
Packin' my car  
With this baggage of mine  
I wouldn't get too far  
  
Stored away on a bus  
No need to hide  
I'm slowing down  
Catchin' one last ride  
  
Been feelin' alright  
For a couple of days  
Either in a fog  
Or a sunny haze  
  
Got a big hole  
In my deflector screen  
What I really need  
Warp nine, Geordi, please  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
  
I'm down the road  
Somewhere in between  
Been thinkin' about  
What's underneath  
  
It's all in my mind  
I got a brand new start  
All I can do  
Is take care of my heart  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
Wanna be a travelin' man
