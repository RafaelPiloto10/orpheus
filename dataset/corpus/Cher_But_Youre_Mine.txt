When people say, you're not my kind  
And that your clothes are out of line  
And that your hair isn't combed all the time  
You're not real pretty but you're mine  
  
We have a great big old society  
That won't make room for folks  
Like you and me  
But I got some real sad news  
For them my friend  
They're on the outside looking in  
  
We've got a great thing going  
And it's gonna keep right on growing  
And I hope that soon they'll see the light  
But until that time  
They'll have to blow their mind  
Cause it ain't us that's gonna lose this fight  
So when we're walking I don't care  
When all those people stop and stare  
If they'd look in your eyes they'd see  
You're not real pretty but you belong to me  
  
Hey hey hey now  
Hey hey hey now  
When you're lovin' me baby  
And when I hold you baby  
(When you kiss you)  
I know you love me baby  
(When I hold you)  
You know I'll never leave you  
(When I touch you)  
I know I'll always love you  
(Every day now)  
You know I love you baby  
You know I love you baby
