Mom bust in, caught me countin money  
Say you better not be dealin that coke boy  
Got caught up in breakin them houses  
First time a young nigga seen 1000  
Then I went and copped my Audi  
Then I had a meeting with a plug on a mountain  
The plug start frownin  
Cus I needed 1000 ounces  
Why you needed 1000 ounces?  
Cus my young nigga finna go snatch em

Callin the plug for ransom  
Rich nigga pull up in Phantom  
Trappin them niggas, flippin them niggas  
Young nigga I'm walkin with cannon  
My bitch got the dope in her panties  
Bitch, sht! You too dramatic  
All of my niggas got money saved  
Bricks in the Hummer, it's automatic

Contraband contraband contraband  
From touchdown, hunned birds on a country man  
The plug is talkin his feel, I understand  
Throwin a brick like Randall Cunningham  
Js they love me cus I got good customer service  
I live in them drugs so sometimes I be mobbin  
Get rich or die tryin like Curly  
The trap consistent, stay and get you slurpy  
You obviously never been in a trap (never ever)  
We shortage you, you ain't get money back  
Beatin to pop more to come and jack  
But big as hell, hit it with the axe  
The gas is ric and you need some Act  
Them stones don't work, just use a match  
I'm fuckin yo bitch, she a natch  
Though the Panamera got a hatch  
Customer customer I am a hustler

Offset is worth 2 million plus  
Offset down the plug now drop it down

Bands can't fit in a rubber band  
No football, I walk in with five plans  
Baking soda with the water stove  
I'mma throw the dope in the fire set  
You get the spatula, I'm the ambassador  
How did yall wake up in like a tarantula?  
Makin moves, spectacular  
In the dope where it's thick and it's logical  
I send the block off in an epical  
For America, fuckin register  
Can't fuck wit you niggas, you skeptical  
Undercover, you work with the federals  
Og get back in America  
Workin my band, I got cookies they edible  
Stretchin the work is incredible  
Catchin a look on the plug so I can go pick up some
