Passed the old church on the edge of town  
Trailways bus was right on time  
Passed your uncle's store on main street  
His old truck was parked outside  
Everything seemed so much larger then  
This old town has hardly grown  
Has it really been ten long years  
Now you're finally comin' home  
  
Comin' home  
You've been gone so very long  
Comin' home  
You'll just say you're comin' home  
  
You left your hometown for the city lights  
You were young and you were strong  
Lots of traffic lots of sleepless nights  
Lots of dreams that all went wrong  
You'll just tell them what they want to hear  
How you took the place by storm  
You won't tell them how you lost it all  
You'll just say you're comin' home  
  
Comin' home  
You grew tired of being alone  
Comin' home  
You'll just say you're comin' home
