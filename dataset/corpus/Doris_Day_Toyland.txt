Toyland, toy land  
Li-ittle girl and boy land  
While you dwell within it  
You are ever happy there  
  
Childhood's joy land  
Mi-istic merry toy land  
Once you pass its borders  
You can ne'er return again  
  
When you've grown up my dears  
And are as old as I  
You'll laugh and ponder on the years  
That roll so swiftly by my dears  
That roll so swi-iftly by-why  
  
Childhood's joy land  
Mi-istic merry toy land  
Once you pass its borders  
You can ne'er return again
