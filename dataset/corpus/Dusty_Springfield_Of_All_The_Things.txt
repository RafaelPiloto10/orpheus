Of all the things I've ever done  
Finding you will prove to be  
The most important one  
I would never trade the tears  
The conversation no-one hears  
The learning how to walk before we run  
  
Of all the kites I ever flew  
Most came tumbling down  
Except the one I sent up with you  
I don't want to change a thing  
Break the spell  
Cut the string  
When every wish I made is coming true  
With you  
  
Sometimes I forget  
To say how much I love you  
Purposely I bet  
'Cause I'm so busy thinking of you  
  
So, in this world of odds and ends  
I'd rather have a part of you  
Than all of my so-called friends  
You have taught me how to feel  
What is false and what is real  
Of all the things I ever want to do  
I think I'll start and end with loving you  
  
Oh, you have taught me how to feel  
What is false and what is real  
Of all the things I ever want to do  
I think I'll start and end with loving you
