I was so hypnotized by the smile in your eyes today  
Flying free as a bird caught inside every word you say  
I want everyone to see  
  
This is big time  
This is larger than life  
See the sparks fly  
When you're standing by my side  
Every step, every move, everything I do  
Life is beautiful because of you  
  
Every breath that you give  
You're my sweet oxygen my friend  
You made me follow it fast so my dreams could get past the end  
I want everyone to feel  
  
This is big time  
This is larger than life  
See the sparks fly when you're standing by my side  
When you're standing by my side  
Every step, every move, everything I do  
Life is beautiful because of you  
  
How did I survive before you came into my life?  
Now I'd do anything at all, anything at all  
For you  
  
This is big time  
This is larger than life  
See the sparks fly  
When you're standing by my side  
Every step, every move, everything I do  
Life is beautiful because of you
