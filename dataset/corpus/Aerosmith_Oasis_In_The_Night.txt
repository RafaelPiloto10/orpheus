These days are slipping away like thieves in the night  
I try to hold on to them with all my might  
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast  
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart the days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You keep our love light shinning bright  
You're my oasis in the night, yeah  
  
When you're in my arms you keep the world at bay  
You stop it at the door  
I don't care what they say  
Time's too short  
The fire's too hot  
Don't know what to do  
'Cause I know in a flash  
It's just a memory too  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart my days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
  
I think I'll die  
I just can't wait  
  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
Aah till our next oasis in the night  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night
