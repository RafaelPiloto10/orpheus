Share my life, Take me for what I am  
Cause I'll never change, all my colours for you  
  
I don't really need to look very much further  
I don't want to have to go, Where you don't follow  
I won't hold it back again, This passion inside  
Can't run from myself  
There's nowhere to hide  
  
And don't make me close one more door  
I don't wanna hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me... (Don't walk away)  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing...  
If I don't have you, you, you, mmmm'...  
  
You see through, right to the heart of me  
You break down my walls with the strength of your love (Ooh)  
  
I don't really need to look very much further  
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow  
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside me  
I can't run from myself  
There's nowhere to hide  
Your love I'll remember, forever  
  
And don't make me close one more door  
I don't wanna hurt anymore  
Stay in my arms if you dare  
Or must I imagine you there  
Don't walk away from me (Don't walk away)  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing, If I don't have you hmmm...  
If I don't have you...  
Ooooooooooh
