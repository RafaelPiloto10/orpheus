Set Sail  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Set sail, the Captains calling  
Its time to climb aboard  
Set sail, theres room for all  
And theres such a great reward  
Theres not a chance you can fail  
Set sail  
You have a been standing  
Staring at the sea  
You have been searching  
For a sense of destiny  
There is a purpose  
There is a plan  
But youll never find it  
With your head stuck in the sand  
Chorus:  
Set sail, the Captains calling  
Its time to climb aboard  
Set sail, theres room for all  
And theres such a great reward  
Oceans of Glory, islands of Grace  
The sun on your shoulders  
And the wind in your face  
Theres not a chance you can fail  
Set sail  
Can you imagine  
How exciting it would be  
To launch out in faith  
And sail across the sea  
You have been waiting  
I think you know  
The time to wait has passed  
Its time to go  
Chorus  
Climb aboard, lets begin  
Give control to the One  
Who rules the wind  
Chorus (repeat)
