I'm ready to be happy  
I've been down too long  
It's time to rise above it all  
I put a big smile across my face as  
I walk down joy street yeah  
Follow me if you can  
But leave all the burdens behind  
Don't look to the past  
It'll make you pasteristik  
Look to the future  
It'll make you futuristik  
Hey mister! Hey sir!  
Don't open that cupboard  
I don't want no skeletons falling out  
I don't want no bones falling out  
I don't want my past  
Catching up with me  
'Cause I' m happy oh...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let sleeping dogs lie  
  
I see two men in the street  
Holding hands and kissing  
The other one looks  
The other one smiles  
When the other one smiles  
The other one blushes  
I didn't want to know  
What's going on  
As long as they' re happy  
I don' t want to look up to politicians  
They' re gonna feed me  
Political bull  
And I will have  
Political diarrhea  
Don't look to the past  
It'll make you pasteristik  
(Don' t look it up)  
(Me just made it up)  
Look to the future  
It'll make you futuristik  
Hey mister! Hey sir!  
Don't open that cupboard  
I don't want no bones falling out  
  
[Chorus]
