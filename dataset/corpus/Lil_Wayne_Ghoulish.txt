Fuck pusha t and anybody that love him  
His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him  
Gut him, lil tunechi shit, weak stomach  
It's me, lt, like when you heat butter  
Old pussy in a can, red is the flag  
Fuck with me wrong I'll put your head in your hands  
There'd be blood everywhere, I got bloods everywhere  
I'mma alien, I hope you ain't the prince of bel air  
That's real nigga talk, these niggas speechless  
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features  
Hammer on my side like I work in construction  
Your bitch hit that head so hard we get concussions  
Niggas can't see me, not even a glimpse  
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps  
South beach bitch and I tan line stupid  
You could find me on collins like bootsy  
I ain't on no fuck shit, I be on that truk fit  
Your girl do tongue tricks and you sweeter than one six  
All I ever see is ben franklin face  
I chase the bank, I don't bank with chase  
You fuckin' with some niggas that'll murk y'all  
Nigga you softer than a motherfuckin' nerf ball  
Bird call, brr, what happened to that boy?  
He was talkin' shit, we put a clap into that boy  
Tunechi!
