Don't take your joy away  
Don't take your joy away  
I know that I have done wrong  
But I'm asking You as I sing this song  
Don't take your joy away  
  
Don't take it  
I can't make it  
I've tried it  
I can't live without it  
  
Restore unto me the joy of my salvation  
Make me Jesus a new creation  
Shake me and make me  
Hold me and mold me  
Choose me and use me  
Chastise me  
Revive me
