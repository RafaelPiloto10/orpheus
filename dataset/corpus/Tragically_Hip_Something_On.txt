Your imagination's having puppies  
It could be a video for new recruits  
Just stare into the camera  
And pretend that you got the flu  
Or dream of impossible vacations  
And get all teary from the wind  
Look as though you're standing at the station  
Long after the train came in  
  
And see how the space tautens  
Like there's something on  
And you're never more hot than  
When you've got something on  
  
Picture a century of water  
Bury the pipeline guy right here  
Kill the dream of possible vacations  
With the sweep of a mapping pioneer  
Outside there's hectic action  
The ice is covering the trees  
And one of 'em's interconnecting  
With my Chevrolet Caprice  
  
Black out to phantom power  
And like there's nothing on  
And hammering the tower  
And now there's nothing on  
  
We'll ride the monorail  
Rocking gently home on the trail  
You want to show me the moon  
  
I know you're standing at the station  
I know there's nothing on  
I know that alienation  
I know the train's long gone  
I can see how your face tautens  
Like you've got something on  
It makes me feel just rotten  
But you've got something on
