Don't play me  
I'm over thirty and I don't smoke weed  
I put my ass away and music I've played  
Ain't the type of stereo you're tryin' to feed  
Don't play me  
Don't play me  
I use proper English and I'm straight  
I'm in the news again for paying dues my friend  
And not the type of ganda you prop in my way  
Don't play me  
  
Don't play me  
I've been to the mountain top and it ain't what you say  
Don't play me  
  
Don't play me  
I'm the wrong color and I play guitar  
My only competition is well in the past  
Time and time if time existed movin' ever so fast  
Don't play me  
  
You couldn't play enough of me now  
To make me feel like a star  
Don't play me I already do in my car  
Don't play me  
  
Don't be mad at me  
The curtain puller in the game  
Maybe how you call us 'niggers' ain't the same  
It's all good when you know the only fame  
Is the light that comes from God and the joy you get to say his name  
Don't play me  
  
Don't play me  
I've seen to the mountain top and it ain't what you say  
Don't play me  
  
Already got laid
