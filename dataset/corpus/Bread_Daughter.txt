Daughter, don't give your love to the first man you see.  
Just bide your time so your heart will be free to find the one,  
Girl you don't have to run.  
  
Daughter, don't think that love has gone out of style,  
Just some folks every once in a while don't understand  
How this world was planned.  
  
Now I know you're wondering how  
You know when the real thing is comin' your way,  
When you live for him and not you  
You'll know that it's truly comin' to stay.  
  
Daughter, I know it's hard to make yourself wait,  
But when the right man comes it's never too late  
So don't you cry ,  
He'll be here by and by, and steal your heart away.
