Gather around  
See is mine  
Disappear that man  
Often distant  
She's laid out by solution  
In the bad talent tv  
She's off in the distance, babe  
And she's waiting for me  
  
I am Columbus  
The prince can take us  
I'm taking it back  
I'm taking the wine  
A secret goal  
Take it back  
When we appear inside  
Made out of purpose  
There are silent tides  
Of you and me thinking, babe  
It's closer to past fiends  
I'm re(?)  
I am Columbus  
Admittedly animal  
I live on uncertainty  
Got well with your last  
  
And he's never around  
The point of direction  
The purpose of town  
Paths to resurrection  
Paths to resurrection  
Paths to resurrection
