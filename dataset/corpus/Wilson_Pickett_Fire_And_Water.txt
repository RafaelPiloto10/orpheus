Every single day I got a heartache comin' my way  
I don't wanna say goodbye, baby but look at the tears in my eye  
I don't wanna say goodbye, mama  
But look at the way you made me cry  
And every way that's nice  
You'll show you got a heart that's made of ice  
  
Fire and water musta made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break  
Poor man's heart break  
Ah yeah  
  
Lover you turn me on, but quick as a flash your love is gone  
Baby I'm gonna leave you now  
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow  
  
Fire and water musta made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes hah to make a poor man's heart break  
A poor man's heart break  
And my heart is breakin'  
Oooh! Ah yeah  
All right  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye, baby  
But look at the tears you made me cry  
Every way that's nice  
You'll show you got a heart that's made of ice  
  
And I know:  
Fire and water musta made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes-uh to make a poor man's heart break  
Fire, fire and water musta made you their daughter  
Baby you got what it takes to make a poor man's heart beg  
Heart break uh baby and my heart is breakin' uh!  
Oh my heart is breakin'  
Oh listen
