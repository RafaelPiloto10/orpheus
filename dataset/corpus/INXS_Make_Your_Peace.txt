There are rivers running  
Just for you and me  
In the darkest hours  
Choices made to be  
I choose to pull my punches  
Don't you test my conscience  
You'll see  
You'll see  
Cut your teeth and make your peace  
That's what you asked for  
  
Got a way of getting  
What I want to see  
When you know I'm winning  
You'll get over me  
All the trash you're thinking  
Don't you feel it sinking  
You'll see  
You'll see  
  
All this bitter fighting  
Makes no sense to me  
We're only talking circles  
We're losing sympathy  
No time like the future  
Make signs like I need ya  
You see  
You see  
  
Cut your teeth and make your peace  
That's what you ask for  
Cut your teeth and make your peace  
Is what you ask for
