When I was a young boy  
They said you're only gettin' older  
But how was I to know then  
That they'd be cryin' on my shoulder  
  
Put your money in a big house  
Get yourself a pretty wife  
She'll collect your life insurance  
When she connects you with a knife  
  
Somebody get the doctor  
I'm feelin' pretty poor  
Somebody get the stretcher  
Before I hit the floor  
  
Somebody save me  
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree  
Somebody save me  
Save me  
  
Everybody's got opinions  
But nobody's got the answers  
And that shit you ate for breakfast  
Well it'll only give you cancer  
  
We're runnin' in a circle  
Runnin' to the morning light  
And if ya ain't quite workable  
It's been one hell of a night  
  
Somebody get the doctor  
I think i'm gonna crash  
Never paid the bill  
Because i ain't got the cash  
  
Somebody save me  
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree  
Somebody save me  
Save me  
Look out  
  
Save me  
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree  
Somebody save me, oh  
Save me  
  
Somebody save me  
I'm goin' down for the last time, look out  
Save me  
Sa-a-a-a-a-a-ave me  
Save me
