"Now everyday I see you in some other face  
They crack a smile, talk a while,  
Try to take your place  
My memories serve me far too well  
It's not like at all  
We just broke up  
It's not like at all  
It was yesterday  
But something I just can't explain  
Something  
And no one ever saw your face again  
Just say good bye to the stupid mistakes we made  
My memories serve me far too well  
The years will come and go  
Some of them will change our lives  
Some of us still have nothing to show  
nothing baby  
But memories  
And I just wish to see your face again  
Won't you keep waiting for that day?  
I know I know I know  
You hear these words that I say  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want
