The falling leaves drift by the window  
The Autumn leaves of red and gold  
I see your lips, the summer kisses  
The sunburned hand I used to hold  
  
Since you went away the days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
But I miss you most of all, my darling  
When Autumn leaves start to fall  
  
I see your lips, the summer kisses  
The sunburned hand I used to hold  
  
Since you went away the days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
But I miss you most of all, my darling  
When Autumn leaves start to fall.
