Yeah I told you Niggas  
Yeah Niggas  
I told yalls I was coming back niggas  
I want it down below homies  
  
Lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome back  
Guess who's back and he is shinin' on you niggas  
Welcome back  
Guess who's back and he is stuntin' on you hoes  
Welcome back  
Yea I'm back and I'm shinin' on you niggas  
Welcome back  
Yea I'm back and I'm stuntin' on these hoes  
Been on my grizzy but now I'm back in the place  
And if you show me the money ill put this brick in your face  
And if ya ain't got mo money ill put this strap in your face  
And believing these niggas is like a slap in the face  
Welcome back  
  
Guess what  
I don't give a fuck  
None of these niggas real as me  
I think I might line em up  
Fuck you man he ain't shit  
What you say  
Suck a dick  
Excuse me if I'm bein' rude  
Let me check my attitude  
Excuse me Mr. Attitude  
Why you got an attitude  
Can't stand the rapper niggers  
Thinking that its trap a nigga  
Where at they do to you  
  
What's happening?  
What up dude  
I've been done  
You too slow  
I'm too fast  
Movin' like slim fast  
Keep my Ronald Williams cash  
In a black Chevy bag  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So kind so kind  
Thank you very much  
What the fuck is goin' on  
Actin' like I lost touch  
I ain't never lost touch  
Dam sure ain't lost much  
Mater of fact I still got it  
Yea you know I'm still ballin'  
  
Catch me in my black T  
But I'm a business man  
Catch me at the kitchen table weighing out my business plan  
Young what your dentist plan  
None your fuckin' business man  
Whats wrong with your pussy niggas  
Needin' my opinions man  
  
OK here we go again  
Street status necessary  
Start talking blow again  
Got that bureau if the niggas sellin' blow again  
Streets think its necessary that a nigga blow a man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In my yayo in my kitchen  
Sky storch every where  
White fat black top  
Kung Fu panda bear  
Call me sense I got the taiquondo  
My Angelina shit I want that Brad Pitt dough  
I said so funny same time snow money  
Ain't nothin' funny bitch  
I'm on my money shit  
A movie star bitch  
We can make our own flick  
I just came to beat it down  
You play with your own shit  
  
Yea OK I'm bout to wild out  
Call it a v neck  
Why  
Took a nine out  
  
750 luck  
750 head  
Bitch I don't even know what 750 is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
We told you niggas right
