I heard about the rock for sometime, I know.  
It's easy to do when you feel the roll.  
Makes you want to get up, makes you want to move your feet.  
No matter how it's done you know it can't be beat.  
'Cause I can't stop rockin',  
no, I can't stop rockin'.  
Well, I can't stop rockin',  
baby, till I lose my mind.  
  
Somebody said it's wrong but I know it's all right,  
then it really hits you like a shot in the night.  
I'm never gonna stop as long as I can stay.  
Listen to me now, can't you hear me say,  
I can't stop rockin',  
no, I can't stop rockin'.  
Well, I can't stop rockin',  
baby, till I lose my mind.  
  
I like to work it down low, I like to work it to the top.  
And when it starts rockin' I ain't never gonna stop.  
Get yourself loose, get yourself high.  
I love to feel the motion and I'm tellin' you why.  
'Cause I can't stop rockin',  
no, I can't stop rockin'.  
No, I can't stop rockin  
no matter what they do do do do do or say.  
No matter what you do do do do do or say, no no.
