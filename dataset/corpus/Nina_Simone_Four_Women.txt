My skin is black  
My arms are long  
My hair is woolly  
My back is strong  
Strong enough to take the pain  
Inflicted again and again  
What do they call me  
My name is AUNT SARAH  
My name is Aunt Sarah  
  
My skin is yellow  
My hair is long  
Between two worlds  
I do belong  
My father was rich and white  
He forced my mother late one night  
What do they call me  
My name is SAFFRONIA  
My name is Saffronia  
  
My skin is tan  
My hair is fine  
My hips invite you  
My mouth like wine  
Whose little girl am I?  
Anyone who has money to buy  
What do they call me  
My name is SWEET THING  
My name is Sweet Thing  
  
My skin is brown  
My manner is tough  
I'll kill the first mother I see  
My life has been too rough  
I'm awfully bitter these days  
Because my parents were slaves  
What do they call me  
My name is PEACHES
