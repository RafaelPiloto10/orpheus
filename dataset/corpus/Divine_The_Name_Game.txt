C'mon everybody, yeah!  
I said let's play a game  
I betcha I can make a rhyme  
Out of anybody's name.  
  
The first letter of the name  
I'll treat it like it wasn't there  
But if a "B" or an "F" ever will appear  
Then I say a for and a fi and I say the name  
Banana fano and for  
And then I say the name again  
  
And I say the name again  
With an "M" this time  
There isn't a name  
That I can't rhyme.  
  
Arnold Arnold bo barnold  
Banana fano for farnold  
Fe fi mo marnold  
arnold!  
  
But if the first two letters  
Are ever the same  
Drop them both  
And say the name  
  
Like Bob, Bob drop the "B" spells ob  
or Fran, Fran drop the "F" spells ran  
or Mary, Mary drop the "M" spells ary  
That's the only rule that is contrary.  
  
Now let's say Divi, Divi!  
Now Divi with a "B", Bivi!  
Then banana fana for, banana fana for!  
Then you say the name again with an "F", very plain, Fivi!  
Fe fi then mo, and fe fi then mo  
Then you say the name again with an "M" this time, Mivi!  
  
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme  
Now do Divi!  
  
Divi Divi bo bivi  
Banana fana for fivi  
Fe fi mo mivi  
divi!  
  
Let's do Marsha  
Marsha Marsha bo barsha  
Banana fana for farsha  
Fe fi mo marsha  
marsha!
