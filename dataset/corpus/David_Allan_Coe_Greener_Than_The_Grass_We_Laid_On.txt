I painted quite a picture for the girls in her hometown  
And she was no exception to the rule  
Singing all them songs about the places that I've been  
Made a body feel just like a fool  
She was like the paper bag that once had held the wine  
Thrown without no caution to the wind  
I left her like the empty bottle lyin' on the ground  
Swearin' I'd pick her up again  
She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun  
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home  
To-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do  
  
I said she was prettier than Paris in the rain  
Lord I filled her full of gypsy lies  
Swearin' I'd be coming back to fetch her in the spring  
Too ashamed to look her in the eye  
She looked about as simple as the cotton dress I've torn  
Sneakin' in her house at 3 a.m.  
Her mama liked to question me the day after and I was sure  
Her intuition told her where we'd been  
She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun  
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home  
She should have never listened to my songs to my songs  
She should have never listened to my songs  
To-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do to-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do
