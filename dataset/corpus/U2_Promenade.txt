Earth sky sea and rain  
Is she coming back again  
Men of straw, snooker hall  
Words that build or destroy  
Dirt dry bone sand and stone  
Barbed-wire fence cut me down  
I'd like to be around  
In a spiral staircase  
To the higher ground  
  
And I, like a firework, explode  
Roman candle lightning lights up the sky  
  
In the cracked streets trampled under foot  
Sidestep, sidewalk  
I see you stare into space  
Have I got closer now  
Behind the face  
  
Oh tell me  
Charity dance with me  
Turn me around tonight  
Up through spiral staircase  
To the higher ground  
  
Slide show sea side town  
Coca-Cola, football radio radio radio  
Radio radio radio
