He rode in town on a white horse  
With nothing in his hands  
He came to gather his people  
And take them to his promised land  
  
When he came he knew there would be bloodshed  
But still no violence made his places  
He came to fight in a battle  
With no guns or money  
But with his empty hands  
  
With his empty hands  
  
They said hey boy what you lookin' at  
As they eyed his dreaded mane  
He said my father has sent me  
I've come back to reclaim  
  
The children whose hearts  
Were so whole and pure  
Now it's you who'll die in pain  
So they lynched the man  
  
Who fooled the word  
And all the children gathered  
In his empty hands  
In his empty hands
