(Dolly Parton)  
I feel so out of place here  
With this high society  
These high fallutin' people  
Don't know what to make of me  
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks  
A small fry in a big pan  
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks  
Fish out of water  
I know I don't belong  
Fish out of water  
Everything I do is wrong  
My style of hair, the clothes I wear  
The way I speak, the things I eat  
The way I act, my lack of tact  
Nothin' seems to fit  
Fish out of water  
Flounderin' round  
Out of my element  
But I'm just as good as they are  
Why do I feel second rate  
It's like, "Sorry Charlie,  
We want only tuna with good taste"  
I guess you could say Wal-Mart  
Is quite a way from Gucci's  
I'm Timex, they're Rolex  
I'm Captain D's, they're sushi  
Fish out of water  
I've had it to the gills  
Fish out of water  
With these yuppie-guppie frills  
Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole  
A catfish in a goldfish bowl  
A little fish with lots of soul  
Out of my element  
Fish out of water  
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut  
Save me, save me  
S.O.S. somebody  
Save me, save me  
Somebody rescue me  
Fish out of water  
Somebody throw me in  
Fish out of water  
On a scale of one to ten  
I'm a two, perhaps a three  
Compared to the big fish in the sea  
I'm washed ashore so save me please  
I'm in an awful fix  
Fish out of water  
Rescue me  
And you better do it quick  
Fish out of water  
It's such a culture shock  
Fish out of water  
My stomach's tied in knots  
Fish out of water  
Fish out of water
