Mercenary battalions  
Are poised to strike us down  
Terminations conquest  
Upon us now full grown  
  
Save me, my heart's open wide  
Help me, no question of pride  
Save me, my people have died  
Total genocide  
  
Devastation hungers  
She waits to leap to earth  
Imminent liquidation  
Before the grand rebirth  
  
Save me, my heart's open wide  
Help me, no question of pride  
Save me, my people have died  
Total genocide  
  
Sin after sin I have endured  
Yet the wounds I bear are the wounds of love  
  
Frantic mindless zombies  
Grab at fleeting time  
Lost in cold perplexion  
Waiting for the sign  
  
Generations tremble  
Clinging face to face  
Helpless situation  
To end the perfect race  
  
Flashing senseless sabers  
Cut us to the ground  
Eager for the life blood  
Of all who can be found  
  
Save me, my heart's open wide  
Help me, no question of pride  
Save me, my people have died  
Total genocide  
  
Slice to the left, slice to the right  
None to retaliate, none will fight  
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives  
This race departs, no one will survive  
Heads to the feet, feet to the air  
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair  
End of all ends, body into dust  
To greet death friends, extinction is a must
