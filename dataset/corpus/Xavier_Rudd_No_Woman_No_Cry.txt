No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
And I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in Trenchtown  
Oba, oba-serving the hypocrites  
As we would mingle with the good people we meet  
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost along the way  
In this bright future we can't forget our past  
So dry your tears I say  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in Trenchtown  
And Georgie would make fire light  
Log wood burnin' through the night  
And we would cook corn meal porridge of  
Which I'll share with you, mmm you and you  
My feet is my only carriage now  
So I've got to push on through  
But while I'm gone  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright well  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright well  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry
