People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads  
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads  
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall  
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall  
  
Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords  
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war  
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain  
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again  
  
Where do we go from here?  
And should we really care?  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy!  
  
Now we've rewritten history  
The one thing we've found out  
Sweet taste of vindication  
It turns to ashes in your mouth  
  
Where do we go from here?  
And should we really care?  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy!  
  
If you're fighting to live  
It's okay to die  
The answer to your question is  
Welcome to tomorrow  
  
Where do we go from here?  
God have mercy!  
  
Where do we go from here?  
And should we really care?  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy!
