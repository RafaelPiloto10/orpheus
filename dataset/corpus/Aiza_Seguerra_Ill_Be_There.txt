When you wake up each morning  
And you feel like calling  
I'll be there for you  
When the road seems uncertain  
And you can't stop the hurtin'  
I'll be there for you  
  
When there's no one beside you  
I'll be there to guide you  
Catch you each time you fall  
When the stars won't shine anymore  
I'll be there...  
  
When the world's unkind  
And your dreams, they need more time  
I'll be there for you  
  
If the rules they keep breaking  
And the future is fading  
I'll be there... For you  
  
The rainbow will end  
In the palm of your hand  
Don't ever let it go  
When the stars won't shine anymore  
I'll be there...  
  
Who knows where we'll go  
What will tomorrow bring  
But we have each other, just hold on tight  
We can take to the skies and fly...  
  
I'll be there for you...  
I'll be there for you...  
  
The rainbow will end  
In the palm of your hand  
Don't ever let it go  
When the stars won't shine anymore  
I'll be there...  
  
I'll be there
