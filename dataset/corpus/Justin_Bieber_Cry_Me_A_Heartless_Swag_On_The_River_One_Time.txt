How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
You were my sun  
You were my earth  
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no  
  
You know why?  
Cause in the night, I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
That's why I said,  
Hopped up out the bed  
Turn my swag on  
Take a look in mirror said "what's up?"  
Yeah, I'm gettin money, Ohh, Ohhh  
  
I want the money, money and the cars  
Cars and the clothes, the shows, I suppose  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful, yeah, said  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
