At midnight, an hour from now... they're gonna flick the switch  
Down the Hall, beyond the iron door... they're gonna end my life  
I will see you all in Hell, isn't that where we all must go?  
I will not tell you what I did... It doesn't matter now  
I will not tell you how weird it is  
To know exactly when you're gonna go  
  
I am a killer  
I'm gonna get what I deserve  
I am a killer  
They're gonna fry my each and every nerve  
  
It is not the soul I sell, it's not the pain from hell  
It is not the fear of dying, of that I was never afraid  
  
I will see you all in hell, isn't that where we all must go?  
Gazing at the iron door, while time is slipping away  
What's really driving me insane  
Is what to do with my final hour  
  
I am a killer  
I'm gonna get what I deserve  
I am a killer  
They're gonna fry my each and every nerve  
  
I've got less than an hour to kill  
I'm looking back at the life I've had to live  
What a waste, what a mess  
I should have never been born,  
  
I hear them coming down the hall  
I know they're coming for me  
I don't need that silly Priest  
Oh, just get on with the show  
  
I am a killer  
I'm gonna get what I deserve  
I am a killer  
They're gonna fry my each and every nerve  
  
It's time
