everybody wants the truth but everybody lies everybody wants some proof but
everybody's blind so open up your eyes i really don't know much of anything at
all but i'll admit we're all the same you ask forgiveness and you make the
same mistakes and i'll admit we're all the same i want to know do these words
mean anything? how can this life mean something more than what it seems?
everybody wants equality but we're all prejudice we're all hypocrites
everybody wants the world but we have nothing
