[Chorus]  
I am the Bullgod  
I am free and I feed  
On all that is forsaken  
  
(I'm gonna get you)  
(I see through you)  
(I'm gonna get youuu)  
  
I'm like a train I roll hard lettin' off much steam  
In the cut-off flanel and the dusty jeans, baby  
I never was cool with James Dean, but I be hangin' tough  
With my man Jim Beam  
  
I swing low like a chimp, back in '86  
Then I was seein' a shrink  
But now I'm humble and I can only think  
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp  
  
So ask no questions and I tell no lies  
I got big old pupils and bloodshot eyes  
I'm on the brink, if you know what I mean  
And the twelve step program couldn't keep me clean  
  
'Cause I'm the Bullgod, you understand?  
The illegitimate son of man  
The T-O-P to the D-O-G, or the P-O-T to the G-O-D  
And I'm trippin'  
  
Unh, huh, huh, said I'm trippin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A lot of people poke fun and that's alright  
But when I start pokin' back they get all uptight, uh  
You can't cap with the master son  
So sit your ass down 'fore I blast you one  
  
'Cause I'm so greasy you can call me mud  
And I feel a little hate running through my blood  
I want to flood the world with my twisted thoughts  
You can bid all day, but I can't be bought  
  
Uh, break it up, let's tie one on  
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn  
So I grab my Walkman but before I cut  
I go behind the garage and fire it up  
  
'Cause I'm the Bullgod, you understand?  
The illegitimate son of man  
The T-O-P to the D-O-G, or the P-O-T to the G-O-D  
And I'm trippin'  
  
Huh, huh, said I'm trippin' (Didn't you know?)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Forsaken)  
  
Psh...You ain't nothin'...Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
(Come on get 'em up)  
(Come on get 'em up)  
(Come on get 'em up)  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(Yeah)  
  
I get a feeling of peace  
From a low so high  
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by  
These thoughts I have, I can't mold the sense  
  
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense  
Born and raised in the outer lands  
And at times you could say I'm out of hand  
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run  
  
Every time that paper hits my tongue  
And sometimes it seems so odd  
When my veins are poppin' and I'm on the nod  
I am the Bullgod, you understand?  
And here in my hand is my master plan  
  
I'm gonna get you  
I see through you  
I'm gonna get you  
I see through you!
