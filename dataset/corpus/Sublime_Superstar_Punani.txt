So tell me if you really want to be a superstar  
But fiesta on the mike and will surely take you far  
You made that drop on the 24 tracks  
We mix it all down then we put on wax  
  
Beginning is hyped when you playin in the bars  
A bottomless pit where you make loose and far  
Take away your privacy and take your guitar  
Then take your woman and impound your car  
  
My beginning of wisdom I won't take you too far  
First you gotta sell your soul to be a superstar  
Baby if you got it forget about that  
Your money don't concern you that's a natural fact  
  
Shut up your mouth before you get knocked down  
We're gonna listen to your voice upon the speaker box  
First you get a manager but what does he do  
I'll be the first to tell you baby that I don't have a clue  
  
We're gunna make a phony image for the MTV  
Hear it on the radio say damn that's me  
Whenever I get over on a 3 piece hog  
Jesus and her mom are gonna break your arm  
  
Put your ass in the john to be a superstar  
I realize sometimes I feel old design  
Oh your reknown position and you just can't hide  
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff  
  
All over the world you gotta take that trip  
And then you never thought you'd see the day you'd act like this  
Your rep is getting bigger than a B-52  
And then it goes around the world before it gets back to you  
  
Hey our love has started can you believe  
Before your eyes this shit just come back to me  
Oh my God I take a rest on the side  
So long so long so long so long I'll see ya  
  
Oh my God if I'd a let my own  
I'd take it turn around and place it home  
I realize sometimes I feel old design  
Oh your renowned position and you just can't hide  
  
Whoa it's the position  
I just can't hide  
Bo  
Whatcha want whatcha need  
  
Give it a bunch of mine and you just can't miss  
Your love feels like this  
Some people love get your shit like this  
Well if you love wad up your love punani punani  
  
Whoa if you love me punani punani  
Oh my God  
Free yeah free oh oh oh hey  
Want the dogs? Let em go. Let em
