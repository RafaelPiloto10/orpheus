I stand before you with my mind open wide  
waiting to receive whatever will be  
the world the eyes survey is not the only world  
for deep within the soul can be found all things  
  
Like the shape of sound, the shape of wind  
like the shape of things when they first begin  
how could I stop what I had to start  
the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
All I want is to love you  
all I need is to get through  
what I believe is a light in the dark  
the crying of a waking heart  
  
You shine inside me like the moon in the stream  
and the waters flow around me  
  
Like the colour of sun I cannot explain  
behind the familiar the view is strange  
maybe to love is to fly apart  
and this emotion the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
(Bridge):  
Golden slumber  
now and forever  
truly rising  
imagine heaven  
one vibration  
this eternal thing  
  
(Chorus x2, out)
