Oh my love  
You say nothing's wrong  
You say you love me  
What we've got is so strong  
But I know someone else  
Is loving you  
Baby if you don't really love me  
Just say we're through  
  
[Chorus:]  
You know I had to realize  
Your love was just a game  
Oh change  
Now I've got to take time to stop  
And rearrange  
Change  
I've got to walk away from you  
Before I lose my mind  
I need a change  
Cause all I'm going to do with you is  
Just keep wasting time  
  
Did you lie when you said  
Your love was mine  
Or was I being foolish  
Cause my heart was blind  
Sometimes I feel like  
Just holding you would make things okay  
But now I see  
The price of loving you  
I'll have to pay  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
[Bridge:]  
Somebody said you don't love me no more baby  
I don't know why you're hurting me  
The way you're hurting me  
Right now I know the truth about  
You and your new lover  
I'm running for cover  
So you can say what you want to say  
Say what you're gonna do  
I can't stand the way you treat me  
I'm giving up on you  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Repeat Bridge  
  
Repeat Chorus
