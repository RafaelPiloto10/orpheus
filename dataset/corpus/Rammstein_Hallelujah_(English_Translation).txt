He is religious and very sensitive  
On his wall is a picture of the Lord  
He wipes the dust from the Bible  
And he happily distributes the Communion  
  
He loves the boys in the choir  
They keep their souls pure  
But the tenor worries him  
So he must be closest to him  
On his nightstand, quiet and wordless  
A picture of the Lord  
He slowly turns it around  
  
When the church clock strikes twice  
Hallelujah  
He folds his hands for prayer  
Hallelujah  
He has lived without a wife  
Hallelujah  
So he must love his neighbour  
Hallelujah  
  
The young man is allowed to live with him  
The sin nests above the leg  
So he gladly helps to exorcize it  
By music and candlelight  
  
When the church clock strikes twice  
Hallelujah  
He folds his hands for prayer  
Hallelujah  
He has lived without a wife  
Hallelujah  
So he must love his neighbour  
Hallelujah  
  
When the church clock strikes twice  
Hallelujah  
He takes the boy into his prayers  
Hallelujah  
He is a true Christian  
Hallelujah  
And he knows what charity is  
Hallelujah  
  
Turn around slowly  
Turn around
