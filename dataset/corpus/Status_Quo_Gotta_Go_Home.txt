I gotta get along 'cause it's a long, long ride now  
I've been away too long, I gotta get on home now  
I'm getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
But the time is flowing now, I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
  
I gotta get along 'cause it's a long, long ride now  
I've been away too long, I gotta get on home now  
I'm getting far too old to know my dream of fortune  
The time is flowing now, I know what I must do  
  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind  
I gotta go home, I gotta go home  
I gotta go home to ease my mind
