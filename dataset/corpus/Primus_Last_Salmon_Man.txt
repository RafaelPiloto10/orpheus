The river water diverts to other places  
To nurture central valley seeds  
The northern waters that sloshes desert fairways  
Fulfill So-Cal golfers needs  
  
The Mighty Chook, it used to run the rivers  
To the grounds where they spawn  
Thin numbers, as the tributaries waned  
Pretty soon, they'll all be gone  
  
Jimmy Mac runs the trawler of his father  
Who got it passed down from his Pa  
Three closed seasons, and a banknote on his shoulder  
That Jimmy's hidin' from the law  
  
Jimmy watched, as the bulk of the fleet  
Sold their boats or moved away  
But after the stroke, he promised to his father  
He'd do his best to stay  
  
He'd remember the days when his father used to show him  
How to set the temp on the gear  
His hand upon his shoulder, he looked out at the water  
Said, "Son it is my fear, that you'll be the Last Salmon Man."  
  
You're the Last Salmon Man  
You're the Last Salmon Man  
You're the Last Salmon Man, from the MacGoverner clan  
  
2010 they re-opened North Cal waters  
To the salmon chasing slew  
Four straight days, Jimmy trolled the jagged coastline  
But, the fish were far and few  
  
Jimmy watched as the bulk of the fleet  
Packed their boats and moved away  
But on his death bed, he promised to his father  
He'd do his best to stay  
  
He'd remember the days when his father used to show him  
How to set the temp on the gear  
His hand upon his shoulder, he looked out at the water  
Said, "Son it is my fear, that you'll be the Last Salmon Man."  
  
You're the Last Salmon Man  
You're the Last Salmon Man  
You're the Last Salmon Man, from the MacGoverner clan  
  
The Last Salmon Man  
He's the Last Salmon Man  
He's the Last Salmon Man, from the MacGoverner clan
