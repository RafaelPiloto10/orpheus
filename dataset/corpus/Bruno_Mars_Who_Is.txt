Oh I was perfect  
For the circus  
If she dared me I'd do it  
Love makes you stupid  
I gave it up  
But I guess it was not enough  
'Cause she never seemed satisfied  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is? Oooh  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
  
She set the bar  
Just above the stars  
A rocket couldn't reach it  
But I still kept on reachin'  
She watched me try  
At least a thousand time  
If she loved me she'd stop me but no  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is? Oooh  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
I saw something worth my future  
So wrong, so wrong  
In my mind I was all it took  
But I guess I wasn't wrong  
  
Oooh I know I'm not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is?  
She wanted someone that's perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is?  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh
