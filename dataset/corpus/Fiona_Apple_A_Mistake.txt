I'm gonna make a mistake-  
I'm gonna do it on purpose  
I'm gonna waste my time  
'Cause I'm full as a tick  
And I'm scratching at the surface  
And what I find is mine  
And when the day is done, and I look back  
And the fact is I had fun, fumbling around  
All the advice I shunned, and I ran  
Where they told me not to run,  
But I sure had fun,  
So I'm gonna fuck it up again  
I'm gonna do another detour  
Unpave my path  
And if you want to make sense  
What'cha looking at me for  
I'm no good at math  
And when I find my way back  
The fact is I just may stay, or I may not  
I've acquired quite a taste  
For a well made mistake  
I want to make a mistake, why can't I make a mistake  
I'm always doing what I think I should  
Almost always doing everybody good  
Why  
Do I want to do right, of course but  
Do I really want to feel I'm forced to  
Answer you, hell no  
I've acquired quite a taste  
For a well-made mistake, I want to  
Make a mistake, why can't I make a mistake  
I'm always doing what I think I should  
Almost always doing everybody good  
Why
