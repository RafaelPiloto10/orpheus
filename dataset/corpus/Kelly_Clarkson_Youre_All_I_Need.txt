You're all I need to get by  
  
Like the sweet morning dew  
I took one look at you  
And it was plain to see  
You were my destiny  
  
With my arms open wide  
I threw away my pride  
I'll sacrifice for you  
Dedicate my life for you  
  
I will go where you lead  
Always there in time of need  
And when I lose my will  
You'll be there to push me up the hill  
  
There's no no looking back for us  
We got love sure 'nough, it's enough  
You're all  
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more  
You're all all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one  
  
You're all  
You're all I need  
You're all I need  
Oh yeah yeah  
You're all I need to get by  
  
Oh you are  
Oh you are  
  
Oh yah yah yah  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Aww Yah
