Grady Johnson was a common man  
Four children and some bottom land  
Early to bed he said well that ain't me  
I gotta spend some time with my family  
  
Left to it's own device, May becomes June  
But children grow up way too soon  
  
[Chorus]  
So love your neighbor as yourself  
Don't use money to measure wealth  
Trust in God but lock your door  
Buy low, sell high and slow dance more  
  
Mama Johnson was Grady's wife  
She bore his children and she graced his life  
Hand in hand and side by side  
They worked hard to simplify  
  
Some folks have and some have not  
What really counts  
Is what you do with what you've got  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And more I think I understand  
What my father's father meant  
When he said son what matters most  
You can count on just one hand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Buy low, sell high and slow dance more
