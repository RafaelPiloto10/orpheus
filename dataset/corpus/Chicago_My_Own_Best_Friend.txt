Roxie: There's only one person who can help ya now, Roxie  
Velma: There's only one person you can count on now, Velma  
  
And now, Miss Roxie Hart and Miss Velma Kelly sing a song  
Of unrelenting determination and unmitigated ego  
  
One thing I know  
One thing I know  
And I've always known  
And I've always known  
I am my own  
I am my own  
Best friend  
  
Baby's alive  
Baby's alive  
But baby's alone  
But baby's alone  
And baby's her own  
And baby's her own  
Best friend  
  
Many's the guy  
Who told me he cares  
But they were scratchin' my back  
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs  
  
And trusting to luck  
And trusting to luck  
That's only for fools  
Only for fools  
I play in a game  
I play in a game  
Where I make the rules  
  
And rule number one  
From here to the end  
Is I am my own best friend'  
  
Three musketeers  
Who never say die  
Are standing here this minute  
Me  
Me  
Myself  
Myself  
And I  
And I  
  
If life is a school I'll pass every test  
If life is a game I'll play it the best  
'Cause I wont give in and I'll never bend  
And I am my own best friend
