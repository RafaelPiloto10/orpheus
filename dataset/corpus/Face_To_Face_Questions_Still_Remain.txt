When I found out  
If I took it as the truth  
Could there be another meaning here?  
If what you say  
Is what you wanted to be true  
Do you know you've lost your reasoning?  
So filled with doubt  
So unaffected by the news  
I am different than I used to be  
And what you say  
I'm so convinced it's not the truth  
Was it me or was it  
I know that I'm still the same  
Everything around me changes  
Questions still remain  
Questions still remain  
Questions still remain  
When I found out  
If I took it as the truth  
Could there be another meaning here?  
I know that I'm still the same  
Everything around me changes  
Questions still remain  
Questions still remain  
Questions still remain  
If what you say  
Is what you wanted to be true  
Do you know you've lost your reasoning?
