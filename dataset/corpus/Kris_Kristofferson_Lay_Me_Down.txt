I'm not mad at nothin' baby, try to understand  
I don't care what happened yesterday, no  
I'm just glad that you're so glad to see my face again  
That's all that's important anyway  
  
Chorus:  
I believe the hardest part is over  
Wakin' up without you everyday  
Nothin' matters now that we're together  
Lay me down and love the world away  
  
We've no way of knowing baby how it's gonna end  
Maybe we'll be sorry one more time  
It just feels so good to me to feel so good again  
I'll just lay my chances on the line  
  
Chorus:  
I believe the hardest part is over  
Wakin' up without you everyday  
Nothin' matters now that we're together  
Lay me down and love the world away
