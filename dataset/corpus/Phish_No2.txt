Feeling a little drowsy yet?  
There ya go, that stuff should take you right out  
Ok, I need you to open up  
Open wider now  
That's it  
Don't close  
Ok, looks pretty good in there...  
Thank you  
Don't close  
This is gonna hurt just a little bit  
Hold tight, don't bite, it's ok  
I'm taking it out, don't bite  
I know it's hurts, but it'll be over soon  
Ok, do you feel that?  
It's losing you now  
Don't fall asleep on me  
Hold on tight  
That's it  
Don't close  
Don't fall asleep now...  
Still in there?  
There we go  
There we go  
There we go  
Almost done  
Ok  
How does that feel?  
Still pretty out of it, aren't you?  
Just relax there  
I'll be back in a few minutes  
Here's a tape if you wanna put on the headphones  
There ya go
