Who cares, I'm in a trance, I got no hope, I don't stand a chance  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Who knows, well I don't care, 'cause I don't fit in anywhere  
But it's all right, yes it is all right  
Well, I'm numb but that's my style,  
I've been numb for a little while  
And it's all right, yes it's all right  
I checked out yesterday, well there's nothing left to say  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized  
Cold inside, anesthetized, 'cause life has got me paralyzed  
Who says I have to pay, I didn't want this anyway  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Who says life is good? Love thyself, well I never could  
But it's all right, yes it is all right  
I'm here dressed in black, waiting for a heart attack  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
I try to talk, I just can't speak, the urge is strong,  
But my brain is weak  
And it's all right, yes it's all right  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized  
Cold inside, anesthetized, 'cause life has got me paralyzed  
And who says life is good? Love thyself, well I never could  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
I checked out yesterday, well there's nothing left to say  
But it's all right, yes it's all right  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized,  
I'm paralyzed  
Cold inside, anesthetized, yeah, I'm feelin' otherwise,  
I'm paralyzed  
Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized,  
I'm paralyzed  
Cold inside, anesthetized, yeah, I'm feelin' otherwise,  
I'm paralyzed
