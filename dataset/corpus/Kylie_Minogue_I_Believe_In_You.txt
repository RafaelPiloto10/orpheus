I don't believe you know me,  
Although you know my name,  
I don't believe the thoughts I have  
Are only mine to blame  
  
I don't believe the magic,  
Is only in the mind,  
I don't believe I'd love somebody just to pass the time  
  
But I believe in you,  
I believe in you...  
  
I don't believe that beauty,  
Will ever be replaced,  
I don't believe a masterpiece could ever match a face  
  
The joker's always smiling,  
In every hand that's dealt,  
And don't believe that when you die  
Your presence isn't found  
  
But I believe in you  
I believe in you  
But I believe in you  
I believe in you...  
  
And if you ever had to go away  
Nothing in my world could ever be the same,  
Nothing lasts forever but together till then  
I'll give you everything I ever get and again  
  
'Cause I believe in you, I believe in,  
I believe in you, I believe in,  
[Repeat]  
  
But I believe in you,  
I believe in you  
[Repeat]  
  
I believe in you, I believe in [Repeat x 4]  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe... in... you.
