[Verse 1]  
She hit the floor and make the club ignite.  
She likes a sexy little fire.  
She keep on begging for more if you play it right,  
She can fulfill your every desire.  
  
[Chorus]  
So super natural for real a crazy style and sex appeal  
Hey pretty mama what's the deal would you be mine.  
Hey you got what I like.  
Nobody strut like her,  
Can't nobody touch, nobody cut like her,  
Nobody touch her (nobody nobody nobody)  
  
[Verse 2]  
She got the music pumping through her veins  
The way she do it makes you wanna (get up and touch that body oh)  
I like to sit and watch her do her thing but in a minute I'ma join her.  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Nobody touch her, body cut like her, nobody touch her.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
