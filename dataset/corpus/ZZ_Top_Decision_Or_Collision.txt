She's so fine, makes me lose my mind,  
I wish to apply my manhood.  
I'll be glad to go to her pad and  
Maybe the whole band could.  
  
I got to make a decision  
To avoid a collision.  
  
She's so tuff, my knee's a little rough  
From crawlin' on across her floor.  
If she'd place an order I'd drink her bath water and  
Not even use a chaser.  
  
I got to make a decision  
To avoid a collision.  
  
Her lips are wet and I'd make a bet  
She's been suckin' on her watermellon rind.  
She's a picture of wealth and I know myself  
That I'd take what she leaves behind.
