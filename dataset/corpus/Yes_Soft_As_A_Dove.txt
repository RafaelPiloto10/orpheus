Soft as a dove  
Touching the hand that lays next to me  
Innocent light  
Leading us through a moment in time  
  
Then you came home  
I let you cry like a father should do  
Innocent light  
Leading us to a moment in time  
  
Soft as a dove  
Touching the hand that lays next to me  
Innocent light  
Leading us through this moment in time  
Thoughts run away  
You're overcome by a flood of believing  
  
Just like a dove you're flying away  
Everything beautiful coming your way  
Everything beautiful coming your way
