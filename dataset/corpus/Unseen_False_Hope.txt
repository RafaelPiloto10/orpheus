Your Expecting one well here it comes.  
It's all been said it's all been done  
This world will never change  
So I hope it burns down.  
Your Expecting one well here it comes.  
It's all been said it's all been done  
Well fuck the government, fuck the world.  
So I hope it burns down.  
I still despise the government  
And nothings getting solved  
You think your so fucking right  
Just think once for yourself.  
Try all you want  
Nothings getting solved  
False hope  
I have not changed my views  
But every band reports the same news  
So let them tell you punks not dead  
Maybe they can get ahead  
Is that the subject you want to hear  
Nothings changed except the year  
I don't want to repeat someone else's lines.  
That's such a waste of time.
