Setting sun deals hands of gold  
There's velvet eyes in Mexico  
Just a fall away  
And all she said was true  
  
Speak in tongues, speak in lies  
Drooling livers, born to die  
It's a wonder that those guns don't point at you  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Keep sayin', go on,  
Keep sayin', go on,  
Keep sayin',  
You won't live forever  
  
Point and shoot, I know just what you mean  
In a world that's full of shit and gasoline, baby  
One dog's dead one's on the phone  
Just leave a lung or leave it alone  
It's that same on song again  
I hate it 'cause it's true  
  
Oh oh oo oo  
  
[Chorus: x2]
