Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
Tonight's the night I've waited for  
Because you're not a baby anymore  
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
What happened to that funny face  
My little tomboy now wears satin and lace  
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
When you were only six  
I was your big brother  
Then when you were ten  
We didn't like each other  
When you were thirteen  
You were my funny valentine  
But since you've grown up  
Your future is sewn up  
From now on you're gonna be mine, so  
  
If I should smile with sweet surprise  
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes  
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen  
  
If I should smile with sweet surprise  
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes  
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Happy birthday sweet sixteen
