A day, a day of glory!  
A day that ends our woe!  
A day that tells of triumph  
Against our vanquish'd foe!  
Yield, summer's brightest sunrise,  
To this December morn:  
Life up your gates, ye Princes  
And let the Child be born!  
  
With Gloria in excelsis  
Archangels tell their mirth:  
With Kyrie eleyson  
Men answer upon the earth:  
And angels swell the triumph,  
And mortals raise the horn,  
Life up you gates, ye Princes,  
And let the Child be born.  
  
He comes, His throne the manger
