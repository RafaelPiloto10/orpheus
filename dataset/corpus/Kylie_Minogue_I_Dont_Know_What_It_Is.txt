Can you feel it'  
  
Nothing that I do is right  
I think I've had an oversight  
You don't know what you're doin' to me  
Why do you always put me down  
It's better when you're not around  
We always seem to disagree  
  
You're killing our love  
You're screwing me up  
I can't take no more  
And I've had enough  
Again it ain't right  
I'm choking inside  
I love you in death and the afterlife  
  
But I don't know what it is that keeps me goin'  
You get enough of this, it keeps us flowin'  
I'm pushin' ahead, and you can't stop me now  
  
Took some time to realize  
I saw it right before my eyes  
That we don't get along anymore  
I tried my best to make it work  
You always keep me in the dark  
And now I'm feeling oh so unsure  
  
But you know I love ya  
You're stringin' me out  
I can't anymore and I've had enough  
And it ain't right  
I'm chokin' inside  
I'll love you to death in the afterlife  
  
But I don't know what it is that keeps me goin'  
You get enough of this, it keeps us flowin'  
I'm pushin' ahead, and you can't stop me now  
And I don't know what it is that makes it matter  
So tell me what to give to make it better  
I'm pushing ahead, and you can't stop me now  
  
Pushin' and a-shovin'  
Pushin' and a-shovin'  
Pushin' and a-shovin'  
Pushin' and a-shovin'  
  
But I don't know what it is that keeps me goin'  
You get enough of this, it keeps us flowin'  
I'm pushin' ahead, and you can't stop me now  
And I don't know what it is that makes it matter  
So tell me what to give to make it better  
I'm pushing ahead, and you can't stop me now  
  
Don't know what it is  
Don't know what it is  
Don't know what it is
