Well I'm leaving my family  
I'm leaving all my friends  
My body's at home  
But my heart's in the wind  
And the clouds are like headlines  
Upon a new front page sky  
My tears are salt water  
The moon's full and high  
  
And I know Joe Conrad would be proud of me  
Many before me been called by the sea  
To be up in the crow's nest singing my saying  
Shiver me timbers let's all sail away  
  
And the fog lifting  
The sand shifting  
I'm drifting on out  
Old Captain Ahab got nothing on me  
Swallow me, don't follow me  
I'm traveling alone  
The water's my daughter  
I skip like a stone  
  
And the fog lifting  
The sand shifting  
I'm drifting on out  
Old Captain Ahab got nothing on me  
Swallow me, don't follow me  
I'm traveling alone  
The water's my daughter  
I skip like a stone  
  
Won't you please call my family  
Tell them not to cry  
My goodbyes are written  
By the moon in the sky  
Say nobody knows me  
I've got no reason to stay  
Shiver me timbers  
I'm sailing away  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
