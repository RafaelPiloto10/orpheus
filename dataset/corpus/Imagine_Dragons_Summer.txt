[Verse 1]  
If only for a second  
Let me have you  
Tell me all your secrets  
Let me know you  
  
Paint me all your pictures  
Hang them on my wall  
Show me all your colors  
Show me all of those  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
  
[Verse 2]  
A fire burns into you  
Purifying all  
And what I saw was opulence  
And that's not for me  
And that's not for me  
And that's not for me  
  
[Bridge]  
Only in the summertime  
Only in the summertime  
Things will change with time  
Only in the summertime  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
  
[Bridge]  
Only in the summertime  
Only in the summertime  
Things will change with time  
Only in the summertime
