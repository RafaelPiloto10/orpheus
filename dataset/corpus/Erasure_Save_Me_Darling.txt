Why should it matter how i feel  
This old romantic down at hill  
Then again, if I'd known the outcome, sure you'd win.  
  
Illusion shattered, made them real  
A night of magic, fate is sealed  
Ran amok, and you knocked my tiny world for six  
  
It wouldn't have made the slightest , blindest bit of difference  
  
[Chorus]  
All together now, lets hear us pray  
Make it better now and savor the day  
I'm all over, save me darling!  
  
I feel it deep down deep inside  
Can not believe we're still alive  
That is good, cause i did not mean you harm, my love  
  
We took a shot at masquerade  
Came crashing down on love's parade  
We were young, were so full of teen emotion then  
  
We couldn't have made the slightest, blindest bit of difference  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We couldn't have made the slightest, blindest bit of difference  
All together  
  
[Chorus]
