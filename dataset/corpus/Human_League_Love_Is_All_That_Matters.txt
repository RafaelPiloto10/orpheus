Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Got this beautiful situation  
I've finally found out  
What life's about  
Want to talk about it  
In my conversation  
Going to tell the world  
Going to sing it  
From the highest mountain top  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Every person pledge allegiance  
All our efforts  
To one common cause  
Take a minute to improve a life  
Form a legion  
That's united for a love cause  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters
