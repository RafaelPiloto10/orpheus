I want more

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah  
  
Friday night and we're just talking  
Stars are crashing in the sky  
Burning just for you and I  
  
We don't need to over think this  
Nothing is going to bring us down  
Show them what we're all about  
  
All the way, one hundred one percent touch down  
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack on  
Take this town  
  
Let's go, whatchya wanna wait for?  
Let's take everything we ask for  
Come on and turn it up  
Let's tell the world we want  
More  
More  
More  
I want more  
  
Let's go, take over the dance floor  
You'd be mine and I will be yours  
Come on and let it play  
Let me hear you say  
More  
More  
More  
I want more  
I want more  
  
Take my hand and pull me closer  
Whisper nothings in my ear  
Until the walls just disappear  
  
Feel the music  
Take you higher  
Feel my heart beat like a drum  
Baby you're the only one  
  
All the way, one hundred one percent touch down  
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack on  
Take this town  
  
Let's go, whatchya wanna wait for?  
Let's take everything we ask for  
Come on and turn it up  
Let's tell the world we want  
More  
More  
More  
I want more  
  
Let's go, take over the dance floor  
You'd be mine and I will be yours  
Come on and let it play  
Let me hear you say

Come on everybody, lets go party  
Till' they kick us out now  
  
I don't care

Once get it started, we won't stop  
Until we get it all out  
  
Take me there
