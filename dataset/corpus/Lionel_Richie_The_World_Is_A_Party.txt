The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
As I watch the world as it keeps spinning round  
And try to figure out what's going down  
With so much joy and love in demand  
Why can't we get it right and understand  
  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
Look at the faces out there everywhere  
There is a happiness we all can share  
Walk in the sunshine come out the rain  
It's time to face the truth that we're all the same  
  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
It's so right it can't be wrong  
All you got to do is come along  
It's our time to celebrate  
Tonight it's gonna be that way  
  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
It's so right it can't be wrong  
All you got to do is come along  
It's our time to celebrate  
Tonight it's gonna be that way  
  
The world is a party, The world is a party...
