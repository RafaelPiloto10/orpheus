Earnestly I sought You, lovingly You found me  
Embraced me as Your child, now I'll never be the same  
No greater love than Yours, Lord, never known it before  
Only ever dreamed about this abundant love  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You, Lord, I'll praise forevermore  
How could I say thank You for joy and peace so beautiful?  
Father, friend, my Jesus, lover of my soul  
Savior of the world, I, I dance before Your throne  
Now all that is within me will rise to glorify  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You, Lord, I'll praise forevermore  
"Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
"Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You, Lord, I'll praise forevermore
