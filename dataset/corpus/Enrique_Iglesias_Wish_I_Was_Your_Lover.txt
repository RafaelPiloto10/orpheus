You know I got this feeling that I just can't hide  
I try to tell you how I feel  
I try to tell you but I'm me  
Words don't come easily  
When you get close I share them  
  
I watch you when you smile  
I watch you when you cry  
And I still don't understand  
I can't find the way to tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish I was your lover  
I wish that you were mine  
Baby I got this feeling  
That I just can't hide  
  
Don't try to run away  
There's many things I wanna say  
No matter how it ends  
Just hold me when I tell you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Oh I need is a miracle  
Oh baby all I need is you  
All I need is a love you give  
Oh baby all I need is you  
Baby you  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
Just wanna be your lover  
Just wanna be the one  
Let me be the lover  
Let me be the one  
Yeah yeah
