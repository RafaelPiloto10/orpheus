When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap your hands dance, dance  
  
Dance, everybody down with us just dance  
Wanna feel the groove then clap your hands  
They ask who's been blessed tonight, I am  
God's been good to me, never to be too late  
And continually he's great he's on time  
Even if I have to sit and wait  
  
Sitting in the corner reminiscing  
The course my life  
Has taken all my ups and all my downs  
But your mercy and grace brought me to this place  
  
When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap you hands dance, dance  
  
Trials and pain temptations reign  
I never see how I'm gone make it though on my own  
Not a chance, so I have to turn to you  
Then you come and rescue me once again and again  
So right now all I can do is give you praise  
  
It's alright, it's okay, come clap your hands  
Give him praise, give him praise  
Go ahead just stand up  
Come on shout and dance, give him praise  
  
When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap your hands, dance
