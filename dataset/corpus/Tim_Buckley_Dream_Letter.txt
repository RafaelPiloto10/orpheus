Lady time fly away  
I've been thinking 'bout my yesterday  
Oh, please listen darlin' to my empty prayers  
Sleep inside my dreams tonight  
All I need to know tonight are you and my child  
  
Oh, is he a soldier or is he a dreamer?  
Is he mama's little man?  
Does he help you when he can?  
Or does he ask about me?  
  
Just like a soldier boy  
I been out fighting wars  
That the world never knows about  
But I never win them loud  
There's no crowds around me  
  
But when I get to thinkin'  
'Bout the old days  
When love was here to stay  
I wonder if we'd ever tried  
Oh, what I'd give to hold him.
