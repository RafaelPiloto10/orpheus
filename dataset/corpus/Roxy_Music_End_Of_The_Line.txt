Think I'll walk out in the rain  
Called you time and time again  
I got no reply  
You've gone  
Reached the point of no return  
The more I see the more I stand alone  
I see the end of the line  
Were you ever lonely?  
Mystified and blue?  
  
Realising only  
Your number's up  
You're through  
Done my share of winning  
Now's my turn to lose  
After a fair beginning  
The game's up  
I'm through  
  
Think I'll walk out in the storm  
There no love to keep me warm inside  
Hope it's fine at the end of the line  
Now's the time to take a dive  
Try a magic carpet ride  
Everything is wrong  
You've gone  
  
If you ever miss me  
If I should cross your mind  
You know where to find me  
I'll be waiting at the end of the line
