Well it's a cloudy morning  
But I got the sun in my life  
I wanna feel what forever feels like  
With you by my side  
  
People trying to sell you freedom  
But they never been held by your love  
  
[Chorus]  
Every little thing, every little thing  
Your love is all I see  
Every little thing, every little thing  
You make me feel complete  
All the little things, all the little things  
Can wait until tomorrow,  
Every little thing, every little thing  
Your love is all I need  
  
And I get lost in my head sometimes  
And I go somewhere else instead  
When all you wanna do is love me  
You can wait so patiently  
Pull me closer just by looking  
And I'll fall in love all over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me a piece of your heart  
Give me a piece of your heart  
Give me a piece of your heart  
I'll give you a piece of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every little thing you do is beautiful  
Open your heart and let the love come in  
Every little thing you do is beautiful  
Beautiful, so beautiful  
Open your heart and let the love come in  
It sounds so sweet to me  
  
Every little thing you do is beautiful  
Open your heart and let the love come in  
Every little thing you do is beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Open your heart and let the love come in  
Open your heart and let your love come in  
Every little thing you do is beautiful  
Beautiful, so beautiful  
Open your heart and let the love come in  
Open your heart and let your love come in  
Every little thing you do is beautiful  
Every little thing you do is beautiful
