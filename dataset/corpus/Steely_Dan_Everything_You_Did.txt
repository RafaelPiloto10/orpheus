Where did the bastard run  
Is he still around  
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby  
I'm gonna get a gun  
  
Shoot the lover down  
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby  
Traces are everywhere  
In our happy home  
  
Now you better tell me everything you did baby  
I jumped out of my easy chair  
It was not my own  
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby  
  
I never knew you  
You were a roller skater  
You gonna show me later  
Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening  
  
You know how people talk  
I wonder what they say  
I think you better tell me everything you did baby  
  
I never knew you  
You were a roller skater  
You gonna show me later  
  
You never came to me  
When you were so inclined  
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby  
I know where baby's at  
I know your filthy mind  
Now you're gonna do me everything you did baby
