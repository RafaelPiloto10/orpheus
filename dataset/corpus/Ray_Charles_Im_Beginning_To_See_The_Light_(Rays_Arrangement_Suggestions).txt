I never cared much for moonlit sky  
I never winked back at firefly  
But now that the sun in your eyes  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
We used to walk out to the park  
Share some red rose in the dark  
When you came, you gave me a sign  
Like a four hour alarm of fire  
  
Quincy Jones  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light
