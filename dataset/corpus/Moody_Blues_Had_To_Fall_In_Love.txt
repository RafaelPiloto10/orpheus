What mattered to me was the right to be free  
Like I'll be someday  
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way  
The places I've seen and the roads in between  
Make me wonder why  
I'm searching for my dreams up in the sky  
I heard the call  
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall  
And I had to fall in love with you  
The face that I've known seems so lost and alone  
When you're far away  
I'm comin' for you baby right away  
The places I've seen and the roads in between  
Make me wonder why  
I'm searching for me dreams up in the sky  
I heard the call  
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall  
And I had to fall in love with you  
What mattered to me was the right to be free  
Like I'll be someday  
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way
