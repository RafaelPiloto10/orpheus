Firefly, can you see me?  
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly  
Could you imagine? one summer day,  
That same night be on your way  
  
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold  
Seasons have frozen us into our souls  
People were sayin' the whole world is burning  
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn  
  
Upside out or inside down  
False alarm, the only game in town  
No man's land, the only game in town  
Terrible, the only game in town  
  
Passenger, don't you hear me?  
Destination seen unclearly.  
What is a man deep down inside,  
What a raging beast with nothing to hide.  
  
Upside out or inside down  
False alarm, the only game in town  
No man's land, the only game in town  
Terrible, the only game in town
