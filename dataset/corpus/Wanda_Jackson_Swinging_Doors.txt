This ol' smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to  
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied  
I just called to let you know where I'll be livin'  
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside  
I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a bar stool  
And my new home has a flashing neon sign  
Stop by and see me anytime you want to  
Cause I'm always here at home till closin' time  
  
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy  
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind  
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches  
Thanks to you I'm always here till closin' time  
And I've got swinging doors  
Cause I'm always here at home till closin' time
