Ann a-sleepin' on my bed  
Hair a-tumblin'' round your head  
You will always be apart of me  
When I look in your eyes... It's my reflection I see  
  
Ann I wonder how you knew  
I needed someone just like you  
Were you on a beam of guiding light  
That came in my life... Late that september night.  
  
And though I try to hold back the years  
I cannot hold the dawn  
And so I try to hold back the tears  
When love has grown up and gone...  
  
Ann I'll love you 'till I die  
And when you hear this lullabye  
I'll be with you though we're far apart  
And you'll be with me... Right here inside my heart.
