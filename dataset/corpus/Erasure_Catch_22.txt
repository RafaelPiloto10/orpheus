If I seem nervous will you show me what to do  
And does the world deserve us, application rushing through  
A long time coming, yes it's been a long time coming  
And my loving you is a place where I surrender  
In my heart it's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
We close our eyes and chase away the sorry things  
You make it easy for me life is but a dream  
Cried on your shoulder  
Dove into the great blue yonder  
  
And my loving you is a place where I surrender  
Touch my heart, it's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
Loving you, is a place where I surrender  
In my heart  
No catch twenty-two  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
  
No misdemeanor, there's a ring upon my finger  
And my loving you is a place where I surrender  
In my heart  
It's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
Loving you, is a place where I surrender  
Touch my heart  
No catch 22  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
Loving you is a place where I surrender  
In my heart  
It's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you.
