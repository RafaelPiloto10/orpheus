When Christ was born of Mary free,  
In Bethlehem in that fair city,  
Angels sung e'er with mirth and glee,  
  
[Chorus:]  
In excelsis gloria,  
In excelsis gloria,  
In excelsis gloria,  
In excelsis gloria.  
  
Herdmen beheld these angels bright-  
To them appeared with great light,  
And said, "God's son is born this night."  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
This King is come to save His kind,  
In the Scripture as we find
