Sometimes I feel like I don't know  
Sometimes I feel like checkin' out  
I want to get it wrong  
Can't always be strong  
And love it won't be long...  
  
Oh sugar, don't you cry  
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes  
You know I need you to be strong  
And the day is as dark as the night is long  
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean  
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
(Alright now)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
You bury your treasure  
Where it can't be found  
But your love is like a secret  
That's been passed around  
There is a silence that comes to a house  
Where no one can sleep  
I guess it's the price of love  
I know it's not cheap  
  
(Oh, come on)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
(Oh, come on)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
Oh... Ultraviolet...  
Ultraviolet...  
Ultraviolet...  
Ultraviolet...  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
I remember  
When we could sleep on stones  
Now we lie together  
In whispers and moans  
When I was all messed up  
And I had opera in my head  
Your love was a light bulb  
Hanging over my bed  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
(Oh, come on)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
Ultraviolet...  
[Repeat 4 times]  
  
Baby, baby, baby...  
Baby, baby, baby...  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
[Repeat 3 times]  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way
