The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
The sisters dancing  
No happy ending to the game  
Don't bother to call me  
Think I'll stay here just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Flaming September  
What can you give me that is true?  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave to you?  
  
The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
My youth lies bruised and broken  
No happy ending to the game  
Don't bother to tell me  
I'll live on here just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Flaming September  
What can you show me that is true?  
My heart remembers  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave  
To you?  
  
Flaming September  
Flaming September
