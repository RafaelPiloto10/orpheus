The man on your own  
Why don't you put some base on your tongue?  
Can't you see that here is lonely?  
Taking care of all day long  
You're making me leave  
Shoulda give me a reason to breathe  
Definitely not, no that's not what I mean  
I'm so done with pleasing you  
I'm so over needing you  
All this space just gave me room so I could fly  
What I thought would make me die  
Makes me feel like I'm alive  
Boy your words don't carry weight to hold me down  
  
I'm still so good over you  
I'm still so good over you  
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank  
Even if you were my only way  
I'm still so good over you  
I'm still good

I'm still good  
I'm still good  
I'm still good  
  
I bet you think I need you  
I'm telling I don't, you've lost your mind  
I used to be so see-through  
But now I never let you on my mind  
I'm worth a bunch of millions  
But you be acting like your money is mind  
I want the Eiffel chilling  
I'll be damned if I let you blow my eye  
Baby what you think about life  
Without me by your side  
I bet you wanna get it right  
But even if you get it right  
  
I'm still so good over you  
I'm still so good over you  
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank  
Even if you were my only way  
I'm still so good over you  
I'm still good  
I'm still good  
I'm still good
