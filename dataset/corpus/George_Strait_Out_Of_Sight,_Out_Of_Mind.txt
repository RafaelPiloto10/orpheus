I've always heard people say it  
But I guess I never fully understood it  
I thought that they meant, you'd be easy to forget  
But it's drivin' me crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
Out of sight out of mind  
You opened my eyes, and now I can see  
What you mean to me, I was so blind  
Out of sight out of mind  
  
You know it hurt when you left me  
But I thought life would go on without you  
That was easier said, can't get you outta my head  
I don't know if I'll make it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was so blind  
Out of sight out of mind
