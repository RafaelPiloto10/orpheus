Found on hideaway and highway.  
  
Alone, sitting here on my own  
There's no place I'd rather be  
Or so it seems  
  
Home, miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see?  
  
You hold your life in your hands  
And no one takes from a man  
Who gives the best that he can  
To make someone understand  
  
I've flown miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see?  
  
You hold your life in your hands  
And no one takes from a man  
Who gives the best that he can  
To make someone understand  
  
Home, miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?
