Get up face this day  
Find some way to make the mean kids pay  
Playing it safe, it's your morals at stake  
You're a young man who's willing to wage war  
Break from the mold, never do what your told  
After all what are feelings of rage for  
  
So I say, I got a sureshot way to work things out  
All of this arguing has worn you down  
I got a sureshot way to kill your doubts  
Find what your following and chase it down  
  
Get up, face this year  
Days will fade with all your childhood fears  
All of the nights, all of the friends and the fights  
You're a young man, who's burning to break free  
Here are your rights and your name's up in lights  
Don't abuse be the best that you can be  
  
Bye mom and dad, you're all I had  
I'm finding out I'm on my own, I am all alone  
Break from the mold  
  
I've got a sureshot way to work things out  
All of this growing up has worn you down  
I've got a sureshot way to kill your doubts  
Find what your following and chase it down
