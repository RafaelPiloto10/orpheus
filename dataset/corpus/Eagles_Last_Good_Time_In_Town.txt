I like to go out every now and then  
I can't wait to do it again  
But I haven't had the time  
Lately  
  
I like to step out every once in a while  
I kind of like to do it in style  
I haven't had the time  
Lately  
  
Lately I've been stayin' at home  
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)  
Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone  
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)  
  
And I dream I'm on vacation  
'Cause I like the way that sounds  
It's a perfect occupation  
For me  
I don't mind being by myself  
If there's no one else around  
It's the last good time in town  
  
Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job  
Stay up late with the same old mob  
But it hasn't crossed my mind  
Lately  
  
Put on a suit, work downtown  
Then come up when the sun goes down  
No, I haven't had the time  
Lately  
  
Lately I've been stayin' at home  
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)  
Closin' the curtains, play jazz on trombone  
(Jazz on trombone, jazz on trombone)  
  
And I dream I'm on vacation  
No, you won't see me around  
It's a perfect situation  
For me  
I don't mind being by myself  
'Cause I know you'll come on down  
It's the last good time in town  
  
Lately I've been stayin' at home  
(Stayin' at home, stayin' at home)  
Workin' the crosswords, turn off the phone  
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)  
  
And I dream I'm on vacation  
'Cause I like the way that sounds  
It's a perfect occupation  
For me, yes it is  
I don't mind being by myself  
If you don't see me around  
It's the last good time, last good time in town
