I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind  
Well she's got baggage and it's all the emotional kind  
She talks about closure and that validation bit  
I don't mean to be insensitive, but I really hate that shit  
  
Oh man she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
She thinks she's the victim  
Yeah  
  
Now I know she'll feel abandoned  
If I don't stay over late  
And I know she's afraid to commit  
But it's only our second date  
  
Oh man she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
She thinks she's the victim  
But she takes it all out on me  
  
I don't know why you're messed up  
I don't know why your whole life is a chore  
Just do me a favor  
And check your baggage at the door  
  
Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind  
But when she calls out his name in bed  
That's where I draw the line  
You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone  
But I wish you wouldn't call me daddy  
When we're gettin' it on  
  
Oh man she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
She's playing the victim  
And taking it all out on me  
My god she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
  
If you think I'm controlling  
Then why do you follow me around  
If you're not co-dependent  
Then why do you let others drag you down  
  
I don't know why you're messed up  
I don't know why your whole life is a chore  
Just do me a favor  
And check your baggage at the door
