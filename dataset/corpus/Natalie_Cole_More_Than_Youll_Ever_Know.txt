Take my hand  
We'll walk awhile, we'll talk awhile  
Feel my love  
Always there beside you  
  
Be the one  
I know you'll tell me everything  
You are the one  
I cherish more than anything  
  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
I love you more than you'll ever see  
More than my heart could ever show  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
  
Think of me  
And know that I'll believe in you  
There'll always be  
This precious time together  
  
With every tear  
A love so strong  
No words could ever say  
A love to last forever  
  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
I love you more than you'll ever see  
More than my heart could ever show  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
  
Take my hand  
We'll walk awhile, we'll talk awhile  
Feel my love  
Always there beside you  
  
Be the one  
I know you'll tell me everything  
You are the one  
I cherish more than anything  
  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
I love you more than you'll ever see  
More than my heart could ever show  
I love you more than you'll ever know
