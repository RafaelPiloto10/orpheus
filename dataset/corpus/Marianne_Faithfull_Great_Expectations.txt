Great expectations I have to find  
I want to tell you what it was like  
My recollection is not too clear  
So much hope and so much fear  
  
Long conversations into the night  
Not like that, oh no, not so black and white  
The great temptation's to try and please you  
Play with you thought and mind, and tease you  
If I could tell my story in a song  
I'd have to make it fast, yes, it's very long  
Many shades of gray between the right and wrong  
  
Day for night, night for day  
All the stories on this way  
Feel the fire burn away  
  
So turn the lights down low, come over here  
Stay with me, don't go, you'll see my characters appear  
The storyteller's magic doesn't lie  
He'll make you laugh to make you cry  
Real for me is real for you  
What I say is almost true  
  
Day for night, night for day  
All the stories on its way  
Feel the fire burn and play  
  
The story's ended, now you're on your own  
Let's say a little prayer, go home
