I could have been a brain surgeon  
I could have been a pharmacist  
I gave a shot at radio revivalist  
With the bossman I have never been missed  
  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
What is my IQ?  
What is my intelligent quotient  
  
I could have built the Golden Gate Bridge  
Or Einstein's nemesis  
I could have been a derby jockey  
But it's all come down to this  
  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
What is my IQ?  
What is my intelligent quotiant  
  
I could have built Las Vegas  
I could have built a drum sized Rolls Royce  
I could have been President of the world  
Could have had Ali on the ropes  
  
Could have had Miss August  
Again  
Could have had Miss May  
Again  
Could have had Miss September  
Again  
But I waited till December  
  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
  
What is my IQ?  
What is my intelligent quotient?  
  
That's so wrong...
