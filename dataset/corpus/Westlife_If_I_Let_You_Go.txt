Day after day  
Time pass away  
And I just can't get you out my mind  
Nobody knows  
I hide it inside  
I keep on searching  
But I can't find  
The courage to show  
To letting you know  
I never felt so much love before  
And once again  
I'm thinking about  
Taking the easy way out  
  
[Chorus]  
But if I let you go  
I will never know  
What's my life would be  
Holding you close to me  
Will I ever see  
You smiling back at me  
How will I know  
If I let you go  
  
Night after night  
I hear myself say  
What can't this feeling just fade away  
There's no one like you  
Can speak to my heart  
It's just a shame we worlds apart  
I'm too shy to ask  
I'm too proud to lose  
But sooner or later  
I've got to choose  
And once again  
I'm thinking about  
taking the easy way out  
  
[Chorus]
