The great silent mirror  
Under the stars and the moon  
Sounds of galloping horses  
On clouds of lightning and thunder  
A dark and gathering storm  
To scorch the earth for many generations  
A new winter, worse than any  
Called the holy war  
  
A white horse on the clouds of death  
A red war horse to end all wars  
A pale horse in pastilets led by  
A black horse with famine at his gails  
  
The doctrine of hatred  
Nation will rise against nation  
Wash me in blood and let me be  
The first born of the dead  
A crown rider with arrows and bow  
A rare rider with a great fiery sword  
Lakes come from the one called death  
Horror and Apocalypse follows  
Moons two full horsemen ride again  
Their fathers kingdom spun to kingdom come  
I hold fast to what I believe  
Till I see my name stone  
Blessed are the dead  
  
A white horse on the bowels of death  
A red war horse to end all wars  
A pale horse in pastilets led by  
A black horse with famine at his gails  
  
The synagogue of Satan  
Nation will rise against nation  
Wash me in blood, and let me be  
The first born of the dead  
A crown rider with arrows and bow  
A rare rider with a great fiery sword  
Lakes come from the one called death  
Horror and Apocalypse follows  
Moons two full horsemen ride again  
Their fathers kingdom spun to kingdom come  
I hold fast to what I believe  
Till I see my name stone  
Blessed are the dead
