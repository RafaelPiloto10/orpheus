She lost her focus yesterday  
She lost her focus in the sun  
She sits and stares at it for hours  
She says she likes to go outside  
She gets hung up on the wind  
She gets lost inside the happy noise  
  
Sometimes I don't understand her  
Sometimes I don't want to  
Understand her  
  
She says no no no no  
She don't want no double life  
She says I should know why  
She seems happier at night  
Her color TV and her chemical smile  
  
I don't want to know the reason  
I don't want to know the reason why  
  
She says  
Jesus owes her money  
She says  
That the angels are her friends  
  
What in the hell does that mean?  
  
She's got the chemical smile
