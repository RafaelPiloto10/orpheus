How many times have you been pushed around  
Is anybody there, does anybody care  
And how many times have your friends let you down  
Is anybody there, did anybody stare, oh  
And how many times have your friends let you down  
Just open up your heart  
Just open up your mind  
And how many times has your faith slipped away  
Well is anybody safe, does anybody pray  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, life is waiting for you  
It's all messed up, but we're alive  
Oh, life is waiting for you  
It's all messed up, but we'll survive  
  
And how many days have you just slept away  
Is everybody high, is everyone afraid  
And how many times have you wished you were strong  
Have they ever seen your heart  
Have they ever seen your pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She gets high, she gets lost  
She gets drowned by the cost  
Twice a day, every week, and all her life  
She gets high, she gets lost  
She gets drowned by the cost  
Twice a day, every week, and all her life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, life is waiting for you  
It's all messed up but we're alive  
Oh, life is waiting for you, oh  
It's all messed up but we're alive  
It's all messed up but we'll survive  
It's all messed up but we're alive  
It's all messed up but we'll, but we'll survive
