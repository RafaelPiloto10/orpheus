Hero of the night  
Blood and thunder  
Rushing through me  
Till the dawn of light  
The sky is turning red  
  
Like a renegade  
All alone I walk through fire  
Till I crash and blaze  
I'm living on the edge  
  
Start a chain reaction  
Sears the neon light  
Stealing all the action  
Always takes the fight  
  
Leather rebel  
Lightning in the dark  
Leather rebel  
With a burning heart  
  
Master of the streets  
Bullet proof and bound for glory  
Cities at my feet  
I'm turning on the power  
  
Running wild and free  
No-one dares to stand before me  
That's my destiny  
To rule the darkest hours  
  
I can see my future  
Writings on the wall  
Legend in my lifetime  
Stories will recall
