Thar she blows, Jacques Cousteau  
Hear her sing so sweet and low  
Lull me overboard, out-cold  
Gathered in and swallowed whole  
  
Do I want to? With all that charm?  
Do I want to? Twist my arm.  
  
You just hit me where I live  
I guess it looked quite primitive  
What was that supposed to prove?  
Throw the calf or he'll throw you  
  
Sucked in by the victim world  
Thirsty as a cultured pearl  
Culled and wooed, bitten, chewed  
It won't hurt if you don't move  
  
Do I want to? With all that charm?  
Do I want you? Twist my arm.  
  
Musical chairs, double dares, memorized stairs,  
Shootin off flares, springtime hares and broken-down mares  
  
Coward phones, big soup stones, prideless loans,  
Grill sick crows, motel groans and big fat Jones  
  
Martyrs don't do much for me  
Though I enjoy them vicariously  
After you. No! After me.  
No, I insist! Please, after me.  
  
Do I want to? With all that charm?  
Do I want you? Twist my arm.
