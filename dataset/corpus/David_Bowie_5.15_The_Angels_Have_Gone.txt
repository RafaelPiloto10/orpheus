5:15  
I'm changing trains  
This little town  
Let me down  
This foreign rain  
Brings me down  
  
5:15  
Train overdue  
Angels have gone  
No ticket  
I'm jumping tracks  
I'm changing towns  
We never talk anymore  
Forever I will adore you  
  
5:15  
All of my life  
Angels have gone  
I'm changing trains  
Angels like them  
Thin on the ground  
All of my life  
All legs and wings  
Strange sandy eyes  
  
5:15  
Train overdue  
Angels have gone  
We never talk anymore  
Forever I will adore you  
Cold station  
All of my life  
Forever I'm out here forever
