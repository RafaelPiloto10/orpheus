When I first met Doreen  
She was barely seventeen  
She was drinking whiskey sours in the bar  
The way she tossed 'em back  
I would've had a heart attack  
But as it is I let her drive my car  
We galloped through the boroughs  
Like a pair of horny thoroughbreds  
Until I said, "Stop the car, Doreen"  
Well, you can roll your eyes and nod  
But I swear that I saw God in the moonlight  
On a side street in the wreckage we call Queens  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean, Doreen, come clean, Doreen  
Well, I'm pulling into Cleveland  
In a seven-seater tour van  
There's eight of us, so I'm sleeping on the floor  
The guy that plays the banjo  
Keeps on handing me the old crow  
Which multiplies my sorrow, I can't take it anymore  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean Doreen, come clean, Doreen  
Now I'm begging and I'm pleading  
"Well pull over guys, I'm bleeding  
There's a fina off the highway with a phone"  
I'm calling you, Doreen  
But it rings and rings and rings  
Where is it that you are, if you aren't in our bed at home  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean, Doreen, come clean, Doreen
