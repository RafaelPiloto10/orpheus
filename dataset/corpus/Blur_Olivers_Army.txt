Don't start me talking, I could talk all night  
My mind goes sleepwalking while I'm putting the world to rights  
Called careers information, have you got yourself an occupation?  
  
Oliver's army is here to stay  
Oliver's army is on their way  
And I would rather be anywhere else but here today  
  
There was a checkpoint Charlie, he didn't crack a smile  
But it's no laughing party when you've been on the murder mile  
Only takes one itchy trigger  
One more widow, one less white nigger  
  
Oliver's army is here to stay  
Oliver's army is on their way  
And I would rather be anywhere else but here today  
  
Hong Kong is up for grabs, London is full of Arabs  
You could be in Palestine, overrun by the Chinese line  
With the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne  
  
But there's no danger, it's a professional career  
Though it could be arranged with just a word in Mr Churchill's ear  
If you're out of luck and out of work  
We could send you to Johannesburg  
  
Oliver's army is here to stay  
Oliver's army is on their way  
And I would rather be anywhere else but here today (x4)
