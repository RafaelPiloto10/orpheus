It's alright forty days of rain  
My skin stretched out from the growing pain  
It'd be nice to have an explanation  
But it's alright  
  
And it's alright if you hate that way  
Hate me cause I'm different  
You hate me cause I'm gay  
Truth of the matter come around one day  
It's alright  
  
I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand  
I look at the burned out empty like a plague across the land  
And for everything I learn there are two I don't understand  
That's while I'm still on a search  
Through the weather strewn church  
I'm doing the best that I can  
And it's alright  
  
And it's alright though we worry and fuss  
(alright)  
We can't get over the hump or get over us  
(we can't get over us)  
It seems easier to push than to let go and trust  
(alright)  
But it's alright  
  
When we get a little distant some things get clearer  
Yeah give em the space some hearts grow nearer  
I ran as hard as I could I still ended up here  
And it's alright  
  
As I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand  
(lifeline all across my hand)  
I look at the fires of hatred  
(fire)  
Burning up the bounty of this beautiful land  
(burning up the land)  
I know that I'm small in a way but I know I'm strong  
And it's my thirst that brought me to the water  
Well I give it all up then she carries me on  
It's alright  
  
Yeah  
  
And it's alright if I feel afraid  
My plans in pieces  
My plans mislaid  
It's the will of the way  
(the will of the way)  
The will of the way  
(it's the will of the way)  
The will of the only way that could have brought me here today  
And it's alright  
  
And it's alright
