We're bobbing on the surface  
and the shadow glides below  
They say she feels my heartbeat  
Oh, but how I'll never know  
  
That it's the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh that it's the salt that's in our tears  
Oh 'cause we could have come so very far  
Oh in at least as many years!  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
  
I'm building you a pyramid  
With limestone blocks so large  
I drag them from the mountain top  
You'll need a two car garage  
  
And it's the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh..That it's the salt that's in our tears  
Oh..Cause we could have come so very far  
Oh..In at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
Take the highway through the Great Divide  
  
Cause it's the ocean flowing in our veins  
Oh..That it's the salt that's in our tears  
Oh..Cause we could have come so very far  
Oh..In at least as many years  
  
Take the highway through the Great Divide
