My time coming, anyday, don't worry about me, no  
Been so long I felt this way, I'm in no hurry, no  
Rainbows end down that highway where ocean breezes blow  
My time coming, voices saying they tell me where to go.  
  
Don't worry about me, nah nah nah, don't worry about me, no  
And I'm in no hurry, nah nah nah, I know where to go.  
  
California, preaching on the burning shore  
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door  
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light  
Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine.  
  
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no  
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so  
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow  
Still I know I lead the way, they tell me where I go.  
  
Don't worry about me, no no no, don't worry about me, no  
And I'm in no hurry, no no no, I know where to go.  
  
California, a prophet on the burning shore  
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door  
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light  
Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine.  
  
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me  
Them voices tellin' me, you will soon receive me  
Standin' on the beach, the sea will part before me  
Fire wheel burning in the air!  
  
You will follow me and we will ride to glory, way up, the middle of  
The air!  
  
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same and my word fills the  
Sky with flame  
And might and glory gonna be my name and men gonna light my way.  
  
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no  
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so  
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow  
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no  
  
Don't worry about me, no no no, don't worry about me, no  
And I'm in no hurry, no no no, don't worry about me, no.
