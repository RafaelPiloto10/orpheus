Black girl so fine and bright  
Black girl you shine as the night  
Black girl you move me so right  
I just have to make you mine  
'Cause you make me lose my mind  
  
Black girl with beauty so deep  
Black girl just rock me to sleep  
Black girl good things you will reap  
'Cause you're of the ancient vine  
And you're from another time  
And your history's all in line  
  
Ain't it funny how I used to wonder  
How could such a lovely girl give me love  
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
Black girl, your ancestry's long  
Black girl, you're where you belong  
Black girls, have got to be strong  
Got to keep your spirits high  
Got to keep yourselves alive  
You're just gonna make it fine  
  
Listen baby you're the jewel of my eye  
Come on girl  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Listen baby  
I just got to make you mine
