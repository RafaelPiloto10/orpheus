Sunshine, every single day  
Helps to light my way  
And darlin', right before my eyes  
It don't come as no surprise  
That it's easy  
Easy lovin' you  
  
And baby,'til you came along  
There was always something wrong  
Around me  
There was emptiness of course  
But it's alright  
And it's easy  
Easy lovin' you  
  
And sunshine, having you around  
You're the light I never found  
And darlin',every minute you're away  
But it's brighter  
And it's easy  
Easy lovin' you
