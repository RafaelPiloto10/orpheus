All through the year  
We've waited  
Waited through spring and fall  
To hear silver bells ringing  
See winter time bringing  
The happiest season of all  
  
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jackfrost nippin' at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes of a glow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times,  
Many ways  
Merry Christmas to you
