Overkill enough is enough  
There's nothing left of me to  
Devour  
You've had your fill I'm all I  
Have left  
What can stop your hunger  
For power  
'Cos you took advantage of  
Things that I said  
Now the feeling is dead  
  
And that's the ultimate sin  
And that's the ultimate sin  
  
Anyway I look at it now  
The doors are closed and  
Cannot be opened  
Bury your anger and bury  
Your dead  
Or you'll be left with nothing  
And no one  
Or you'll be left with nothing  
And no one  
There's no point in screaming  
'Cos you won't be heard  
Now that tables have turned  
  
It was the ultimate sin  
It was the ultimate sin  
It was the ultimate sin  
  
I warned you then and I'm  
Warning you now  
If you mess with me you're  
Playing with fire  
Winds of change that are  
Fanning the flames  
Will carry you to your  
Funeral pyre  
It's pulling you down  
It's your final descent  
It's too late to repent  
  
When it's the ultimate sin  
When it's the ultimate sin  
When it's the ultimate sin  
When it's the ultimate sin
