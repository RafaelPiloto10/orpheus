We are reincarnated souls (from that time)  
Living on earth, heat, air and water (in this time)  
We are reincarnated souls (from that time)  
Living on earth, heat, air and water (in this time)  
  
In the beginning was the word  
And the word manifested itself in the flesh  
Which even become man  
(All because of the divine plan)  
Man being lower than the angels  
Over all Earth was as he given dominion  
He devised his own destruction  
But the word lives on and on  
  
Who is weary  
Let him come hither  
He who has eyes to see  
Let him look yonder  
All who is thirsty  
Let them drink clear water  
(Drink water)  
(Drink water)  
  
We are reincarnated souls (from that time)  
And we are living on earth, heat, air and water (in this time)  
We are reincarnated souls (from that time)  
And we are living on earth, heat, air and water (in this time)  
  
Nothing is new  
Under the sun  
All has been here  
Since time begun  
And with all the years we?ve spent  
(Only changing names)  
(Protect the innocent)  
Like a seed that is planted by the water  
Appear to die before new birth  
Changing its form to another  
Taking on a structure just as the first  
  
(He who is weary)  
Let him come hither  
Oh-oh  
(He who has eyes to see)  
(Let him look yonder)  
(All who are thirsty)  
Let them drink clear water  
(Drink water)  
(Drink water)
