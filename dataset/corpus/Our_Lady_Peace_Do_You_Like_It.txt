I crawled out from the pain of yesterday  
I crawled to you and  
I said all the things that you said to say  
Have I said enough?  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
  
I know how you're playin' these dirty games  
They're killing me and  
I know how you love to watch me beg  
So here I am  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be the puppet for you  
I don't want to bite the hand that's feeding  
I don't want to be a sucker for you  
Ah yes, you  
I hate myself for begging  
I hate myself for staying  
I hate myself for listening to, you  
  
It's too little too late, I can't escape  
So I'm begging you please  
I changed all the things that you told me to change  
And now I'm on my knees  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to get out  
Stuck inside of this  
Waiting for something else  
Waiting to exist  
Can you offer me help?  
Help for what I've missed  
I've missed  
I've  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For listening to you, ah  
For listening to you, ah  
For listening to you, ah
