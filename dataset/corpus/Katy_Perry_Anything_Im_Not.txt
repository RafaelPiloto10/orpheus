I will never be, I will never be tall, no  
And I will never be, never ever be sure of it all  
Oh, why's the world so cruel to me?  
When all, all I ever wanna be is anything I'm not  
  
Gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not, I'm not  
  
I will never be, I will never be you, no  
I will always be, I will always be me, that I know  
But oh, even though I'm happy being me  
I want to get away from all this harsh reality, oh  
  
Gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not  
  
Yeah, gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not, anything I'm not  
Oh, anything I'm not  
  
Gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not  
  
Yeah, gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I want to be new and different  
Anything I'm not, anything I'm not  
Anything I'm not, anything I'm not  
Anything I'm not
