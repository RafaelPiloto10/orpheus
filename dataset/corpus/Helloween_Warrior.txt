Blackened sky a final flash  
Death is in the air  
Warriors without a face  
Destruction everywhere  
  
Silent falls the hammer  
No one hears the cries  
No escaping from this hell  
Your prayers won't be heard, so die  
  
Brainless cruel commanders  
Sending death and pain  
Soldiers only robots  
Fight for their life in vain  
  
Silent falls the hammer  
No one hears the cries  
No escaping from this hell  
Your prayers won't be heard, so die  
  
Die now die warrior!  
Die now die warrior!  
  
Somewhere in the shelter sit the men  
Who hold your fate in hands  
Playin' chess and you're the loser  
You're a small pawn in their game  
  
Somewhere in the shelter sit the men  
And they don't realise  
A war without survivors is a fight  
That's never won, so die!  
  
Barren land desolate waste  
Destruction is complete  
Survivors creeping through the ruins  
Decaying flesh and meat  
  
Somewhere in a shelter  
Some pigs are still alive  
And still they play the game  
They don't give a damn...so die!
