Ever stop to wonder  
Should I question  
Move a stone look under  
Should I judge  
  
How you have changed my friend  
You're not the same my friend  
Do you lose sleep at night  
Do you ever stop to think  
Where it went wrong for you  
Who turned your reds to blue  
  
[Chorus:]  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
  
Ever stop to wonder  
I should not question  
Move a stone look under  
I should not judge  
  
They say you're never lonely  
They say you're with the best  
But when they turn those lights out  
I bet you spin and turn  
And cry just like the rest  
And cry just like a baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ever stop to wonder  
I should not question  
Move a stone look under  
I should not judge  
  
No need for desperation  
No need for sweet revenge  
Please try to remember  
The door is always there  
Don't you walk on by  
The door is always there  
  
All you want to do is kick it in  
All you got to do is walk right in  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
Oh yeah  
In your heart  
Yeah
