Tell me true tell me why was Jesus crucified  
Is it for this that daddy died?  
Was it for you? was it me?  
Did I watch too much t.v.?  
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?  
If it wasn't for the nips  
Being so good at building ships  
The yards would still be open on the clyde  
And it can't be much fun for them  
Beneath the rising sun  
With all their kids committing suicide  
What have we done maggie what have we done  
What have we done to England  
Should we shout should we scream  
"What happened to the post war dream?"  
Oh Maggie Maggie what have we done?
