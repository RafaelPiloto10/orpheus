She doesn't see the coming fall  
She doesn't show no fear at all  
Bring on autumn moon or the driving rain  
I only hope I see her face again  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything is gonna be alright when summer comes  
The darkest stars will burn so bright when summer comes  
We will open up our bodies to the warming of the sun  
When summer comes  
  
I will wait in the silence until she returns  
To melt the frozen prison round this fool who never learns  
Every living thing that's born must have its end  
What winter takes away, spring brings back again  
  
[Chorus]  
Summer doesn't feel the coming frost  
And she doesn't yield to pain or loss  
Death where is thy victory where is thy string  
When every year we hear the birds of summer sing  
  
[Chorus]
