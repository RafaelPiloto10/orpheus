On just and ordinary day, no reason, no reason for a fuss  
  
But even though, it isn't Christmas, let us love one another, let us love  
  
On just a day, just a day, no special name, no pretty presents, pretty
presents to exchange  
  
Make it a good day, just the same  
  
Let us love one another, let us love  
  
No special greeting, special greeting for the day  
  
No happy easter, no merry christmas, only how are you today  
  
Make it a good day, anyway  
  
Let us help one another, help your neighbor, he's your brother  
  
Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us love, love one another  
  
Help your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, now let us love  
  
One another,  
  
Help your neighbor, he might not feel so good sometimes,  
  
Let us love, love one another, help your neighbor,  
  
Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us help, help one another  
  
Love your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, let us love  
  
Let us love, let us love, love one another, help your neighbor  
  
He's your brother, let us love one another, let us love
