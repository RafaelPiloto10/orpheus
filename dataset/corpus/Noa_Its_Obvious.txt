It's obvious you're special  
I've known it all along  
I suspected you from the moment you flew through my window  
And fell to the floor  
Saying I'm yours.  
Take me, I'm yours.  
  
And it's obvious I'm crazy  
With every hazy dawn  
I inspect myself, and in light of my plight I am certain  
As loud I may roar  
My eyes will implore  
How fully I'm yours.  
  
Have you ever been told you're too utterly bold to be true?  
With a flash of your smile  
I am baffled, beguiled,  
I'm bewildered by you.  
Do you know love you inspire  
Would make me fly higher than I've ever flown before?  
Now inspire me to more  
Inspire me to more.
