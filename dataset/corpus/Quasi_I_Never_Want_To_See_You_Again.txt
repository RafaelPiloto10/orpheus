I know the ether can never claim the earth  
Atmospheric gasses cannot remain with dirt  
We purchase pleasure, and pay for it with hurt  
And we rarely get our money's worth  
See how we grasp at the stars ?  
They're so far away  
You can't even see what's right in front of you  
Flesh wounds heal  
Broken bones mend  
But you're not my friend  
I never want to see you again...  
I never want to see you again...
