Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night  
Tonight there will be no morning star  
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight, and for us, stars will stop where
they are  
  
Today the minutes seem like hours, the hours go so slowly, and still the sky
is light  
Oh moon, grow bright, and make this endless day endless night  
Tonight  
  
Tonight, tonight, the world is full of light, with suns and moons all over the
place  
Tonight, tonight, the world is wild and bright, going mad shooting stars into
space  
Today, the world was just an address, a place for me to live in, no better
than all right  
But here you are and what was just a world is a star, tonight
