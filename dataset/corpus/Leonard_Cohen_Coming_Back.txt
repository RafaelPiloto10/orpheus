(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Angels) You can't do this  
You must do what  
We must do what must be done  
  
(Judy) I hear my baby calling  
He is asking to be born  
I see the curtains parting  
That our kisses have outworn...  
  
(Angels) Kisses all outworn...  
  
(Judy) I'll raise a tent of shelter  
Now though every thread is torn  
  
(Angels) Every thread is torn...  
  
(Judy) I take my life from realms of light  
And hang it on a thorn  
  
(Angels) Hanging on a thorn...  
  
(Judy) I hear the children calling  
Asking to be born  
I see the curtains parting  
And my life upon a thorn  
  
The stars have lost their fire  
And the moon has lost her voice  
And I'm coming back to find you  
I have made the human choice.  
  
(Angels) You've made your choice  
The world you choose  
Garlands of planets and starlight  
Now you lose  
  
(Judy) He's the only one who knows me  
He's the riddle of my life  
And they'll never tell the story  
Of the husband and the wife  
  
(Angels) The world she chooses, she loses...  
  
(Judy) He's the stone that broke my heart  
The foundation of my home --  
  
(Angels) This we must do!  
  
(Judy) He's the sweetness of the sweetness  
Of the sweetness honeycomb  
  
(Angels) We must do what we must do!  
  
(Judy) And he's welcome to his glory  
And he's buried in my life  
And they'll never tell the story  
Of the husband and the wife  
  
(Angels) She takes her life from realms of light  
  
(Valkyries) She hangs it on a thorn  
  
(Angels) She disobeys the law  
  
(Valkyries) The law is broken  
You must get them  
  
(Angels) Get him.  
  
(Valkyries) Get them!  
  
Messenger  
Listen  
Messenger  
Do what must be done  
And our will be done  
Will be done
