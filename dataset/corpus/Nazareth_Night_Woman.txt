She's a night woman of my dreams  
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam  
Silver stardust in her eyes  
In the way she leaves her sighs  
Last night I fell asleep  
Thought I heard her voice begin to speak  
My mind is in distress  
On my cheek I felt her breath  
I could feel her body's warmin' glow  
My frozen blood begn to flow  
She's a night woman of my dreams  
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam  
Comes, stays, then disappears  
In the morning sun my vision clears  
I could smell the roses in her hair  
But when I awoke she was not there  
  
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream  
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream  
Oh, oh,  
She's a night woman of my dream  
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream
