Pick me up  
Been bleeding too long  
Right here, right now  
I'll stop it some how  
  
I will make it go away  
Can't be here no more  
Seems this is the only way  
I will soon be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesn't seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man?  
  
Shut me off  
I am ready,  
Heart stops  
I stand alone  
Can't be on my own  
  
I will make it go away  
Can't be here no more  
Seems this is the only way  
I will soon be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesn't seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man?  
  
Am I going to leave this place?  
What is it I'm hanging from?  
Is there nothing more to come? (am I gonna leave this place?)  
Is it always black in space?  
Am I going to take it's place?  
Am I going to leave this race? (Am I going to leave this race?)  
I guess god's up in this place?  
What is it that I've become?  
Is there something more to come? (more to come)  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesn't seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man?  
Does this make me not a man?
