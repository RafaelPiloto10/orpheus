Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance  
Kick their heels up in the air snap their fingers for romance  
  
While the gentlemen compare blonde or black or auburn hair  
Check the motion and the style Oh, you know they take their while  
  
Hey, to make the motion more complete, yeah, to make it more a treat  
Club D'Jour is where to go come on down and see the show  
  
When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight  
When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine  
  
When the club can't contain the beat it just rolls out in the street  
Spills on down the avenue bringing dancers to their feet.  
  
When it's good as it can be it gets better wait and see  
Oh, these folks don't ever sleep till they're passed out in the street  
  
Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance  
Clap their hands and walk on air, yeah, the feeling's really there  
Won't you take a little taste raise it to your charming face?  
  
When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight  
When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine  
  
Go on take a chance, the ladies do love to dance.
