Woman, if I were a woman I would be man enough to keep you warm  
And, boy, if I were a man I would be strong enough to hold you tight  
And when I cry, and I'm in the mood I will try to keep from loving you  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Leave me alone  
Lovely day  
Love is bizarre  
Lover be mine  
Don't wanna lose ya  
Don't wanna lose ya  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Melancholy  
Don't wanna go  
Lovely time  
Lover be mine  
Don't wanna lose ya  
Lover, if you were my lover would you be kind enough to take no other  
Boy, if I were a man, would I be strong enough to practice what I preach?  
When your out of reach, I would sigh, and stomp, and prove my speech  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Leave me alone  
Lovely day  
Love is bizarre  
Lover be mine  
Don't wanna lose ya  
Don't wanna lose ya  
Love is divine  
Love is the rage  
Melancholy  
Don't wanna go  
Lovely time  
Lover be mine  
Don't wanna lose ya
