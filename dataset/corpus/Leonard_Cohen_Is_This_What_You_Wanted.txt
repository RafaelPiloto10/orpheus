You were the promise at dawn  
I was the morning after  
You were Jesus Christ my Lord  
I was the money lender  
You were the sensitive woman  
I was the very reverend Freud  
You were the manual orgasm  
I was the dirty little boy  
  
And is this what you wanted  
To live in a house that is haunted  
By the ghost of you and me?  
  
Is this what you wanted...  
You were Marlon Brando  
I was Steve Mcqueen  
You were k.y. jelly  
I was vaseline  
You were the father of modern medicine  
I was Mr. Clean  
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon  
I was Rin Tin Tin  
  
And is this what you wanted...  
And is this what you wanted...  
You got old and wrinkled  
I stayed seventeen  
You lusted after so many  
I lay here with one  
You defied your solitude  
I came through alone  
You said you could never love me  
I undid your gown  
  
And is this what you wanted...  
And is this what you wanted...  
I mean is this what you wanted...  
That's right, is this what you wanted...
