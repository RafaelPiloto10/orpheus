Baby, just stay with me a little longer  
Baby, I'll guarantee the feeling stronger  
You don't know what you do to me  
I wanna be inside you, baby  
  
Baby, just stay with me a little longer  
Baby, I'll guarantee we'll get it on  
Read my mind and I know you'll find  
I wanna be inside you, baby  
  
There ain't nothing but love inside you, girl  
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me, baby  
Stay with me a little longer, baby, I'll guarantee we'll get it on  
All I know is what you do to me, I wanna be inside you, baby  
  
There ain't nothing but love inside you, girl  
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me  
Baby, just stay with me a little longer  
Baby, I'll guarantee the feeling stronger  
You don't know what you do to me  
I wanna be inside you, baby  
  
Baby, just stay with me a little longer  
Baby, I'll guarantee we'll get it on  
There ain't nothing but love inside you, girl  
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me, baby  
  
Baby, just stay with me a little longer  
Baby, I'll guarantee the feeling stronger  
You don't know what you do to me  
I wanna be inside you, baby
