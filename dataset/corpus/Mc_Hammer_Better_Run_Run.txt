Chorus  
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire  
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire  
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire  
  
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what  
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what  
That's the fire, that's the fire, that's the fire, what  
  
Better run, better run run, uh  
Better run, better run run, lets go there (oh yeah)  
Lets go there (oh yeah)  
  
[MC Hammer - Verse 1]  
Lets go where the lights is hot  
Gotta back up on the sh-t he pop  
Lets go there, the game is so cold  
I could see it in his eyes, the boy sold his soul  
Devil said I'ma give you the World  
"I'll take it, plus give me a girl"  
Mr Devil can you give me a sign  
He said "Throw the Roc up, that's one of mine"  
  
Lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[MC Hammer - Verse 2]  
Yo Jay, I got a Reasonable Doubt  
If I knocked on your door would you come on out  
If I knocked on your door that mean I'm knocking you out  
If I knocked on your door boy, I'll buss ya in ya mouth  
Uh, see me son I don't play  
I come from the shoulders that due the hard way  
New rules, let me show you the way  
If a rapper talk tough he gotta back up what he say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[MC Hammer - Verse 3]  
I don't really have to go in on the fella  
But that dude wrote back to devil  
Nah nah I don't roc-your-wear  
Your shoes I don't need a dark pair  
That boy tried to steal my swag  
Fingerprints all over the bag  
Imposter get him outta here  
Imposter the king is right here, lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah you're now rocking with the king of heart  
The king of heart, tearing all imposters apart  
Yeah, king, king, king, king, king, king, king...  
  
Lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
[End]
