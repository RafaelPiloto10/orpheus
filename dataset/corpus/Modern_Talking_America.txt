On Monday morning, ocean rain was falling  
And Tuesday morning, many friends are calling  
Wednesday alone, staying at home  
Thursday, oh I wait for you  
And Friday it's only one day  
The weekend is coming soon  
  
America, oh it's Saturday night  
America, laser beams, and lights  
America, people feel alright  
America, let the party begin  
America, oh it's like a dream  
America, let's have some fun tonight  
  
On Monday morning, my heart feels like fire  
On Tuesday evening, I can feel desire  
Wednesday I'm down, spinning around  
Thursday love is in my eyes  
On Friday, it's only one day to my paradise  
  
I just can't wait til Saturday  
I just can't wait cause it's my day  
I just can't, I just can't wait
