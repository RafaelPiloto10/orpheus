What the fuck is this world  
Running to, you didn't  
Leave a message, at least I  
Could of learned your voice one last time  
Daily mine field, this could  
Be my time, 'bout you?  
Would you hit me?  
Would you hit me?  
Oh oh oh, oh whoa whoa, oh  
  
All the bills go by, and  
Initiatives are taken up  
By the middle, there ain't gonna be any middle any more  
And the cross I'm bearing home  
Ain't indicative of my place, left the porch  
Left the porch, oh oh oh  
  
Hear my name, take a good look  
This could be the day  
Hold my hand, walk beside me  
I just need to say  
  
Hear my name, take a good look  
This could be the day  
Hold my hand, walk beside me  
I just need to say  
I could not take a-just one day  
I know when I would not ever touch you  
Hold you, feel you in my arms ever again  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
