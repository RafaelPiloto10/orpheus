Is this the end of the beginning?  
Or the beginning of the end?  
Losing control or are you winning?  
Is your life real or just pretend?  
  
Reanimation of the sequence  
Rewinds the future to the past  
To find the source of the solution  
The system has to be recast  
  
Release your mind  
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul  
Your life's on overload  
Is this your fate?  
  
Will you decide what makes you an entity  
That's your identity  
Well if you don't know  
Which way to go  
  
You might be lost and confused  
A second chance no time to lose  
  
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul  
Transforming time and space beyond control  
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate  
Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late  
  
You don't want to be a robot ghost  
Occupied inside a human host  
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly  
Synthesized until they set you free  
  
Alright-okay, alright  
Till they set you free  
Alright-okay  
Till they set you free  
  
I don't want to see you, yeah  
I don't want to see you, yeah
