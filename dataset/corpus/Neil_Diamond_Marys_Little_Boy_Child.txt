Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the Holy Bible says  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas Day  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing  
New king's born today,  
And man will live for evermore,  
Because of Christmas Day  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bear the child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
By and by they found a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little boy was born  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing  
New king's born today  
And man will live for evermore  
Because of Christmas Day  
  
While shepherds  
Watched their flocks by night  
They saw a bright new shining star  
And heard the choir from heaven sing  
The music seemed to come from afar  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing,  
Listen to what they say  
That man will live for evermore  
Because of Christmas Day
