[Intro]  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Verse 1]  
Waking up, midnight November  
And just still in my bed  
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya  
There's things we've never said  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So if I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's not enough, to say I want ya  
Cause I'll say anything  
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt  
I had have just been questioning it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be  
  
[Bridge]  
All of my bones, they scream I'm right  
If you're taking me home to stay the night  
Darling my soul would heal  
  
[Outro]  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the wrong  
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, how long  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
