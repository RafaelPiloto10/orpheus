When you're feeling lonely  
And you heart is hungry  
I'll light the shade  
When the moon escapes you  
And the sun denies you  
I'll light the shade  
Ooh ma na da ba chicka ba ayy  
Ooh ma na da ba chicka ba ohhh  
Ooh ma na da ba chicka ba ayy  
Eh oh oh eh oh  
(x2)  
When the question's pending  
You feel it all descending  
I'll light the shade  
Out answer searching  
When it's all confusing  
I'll light the shade  
Ooh ma na da ba chicka ba ayy  
Ooh ma na da ba chicka ba ohhh  
Ooh ma na da ba chicka ba ayy  
Eh oh oh eh oh  
(x2)  
Out answer searching  
When it's all confusing  
I'll light the shade  
When the moon escapes you  
And the sun denies you  
I'll light the shade
