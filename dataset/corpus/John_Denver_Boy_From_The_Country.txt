Because he called the forest brother  
Because he called the earth his mother  
They drove him out into the rain  
Some people even said the boy from the country was insane  
  
Because he spoke with fish in the creek  
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak  
Who knows, perhaps they do  
How do you know they don't  
Just because they've never spoken to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young  
Boy from the country, he loves the sun  
  
He tried to tell us that we should love the land  
We turned our heads and laughed  
And we did not understand  
Sometimes I think that the boy from the country  
Is the only one who sees  
Because the boy from the country  
Doesn't want to see the forest for the trees  
  
[Chorus]
