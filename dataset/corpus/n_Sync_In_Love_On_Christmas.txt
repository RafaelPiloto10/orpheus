[Repeat: x4]  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Christmas time is so special (Special, special)  
When you're kissing me (Under the, under the) under the mistletoe  
Exchanging loving gifts  
Sitting in front of the tree  
Me holding you and you holding me  
  
[Chorus]  
Wishing, I pray to be in love on Christmas  
Because Christmas love gives me that feeling  
Wishing, I pray to be in love on Christmas  
Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas  
  
Last year, Christmas  
It happened without us (Out us, out us)  
I was all mixed up and confused  
I didn't know what to do baby (What to do babe)  
I never thought I'd feel this way  
I always thought that Christmas was a happy day  
I always prayed that Santa'd pack love on his sleigh  
And send it my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What a beautiful time (Oh what a beautiful time it is)  
Time it is  
A time to open gifts, and play with all the kids  
Yes, it's Christmas (Yes, it's Christmas)  
Yes, it's Christmas time again (Christmas time again)  
Girl I love you (Girl I love you baby)  
Yes, I love you (Yes I love you baby)  
  
It's Christmas time again (Oh)  
To be in love on Christmas (girl I love you baby, yes I love you baby)  
What a beautiful time it is  
Happy time to open gifts  
Yes now it's Christmas time  
And I am yours  
And you are mine  
Oh when you're kissin' me  
Right under my Christmas tree  
Baby come close to me  
'Cause this is how it should be!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Grandmamma with my Granddaddy,  
And my Momma and my Daddy,  
I'm with you on Christmas)
