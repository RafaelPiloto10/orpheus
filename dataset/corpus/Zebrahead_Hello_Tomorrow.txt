Hello tomorrow and good-bye to yesterday  
We've been waiting for this moment  
And we still don't know what to say  
We may never find the answers  
or know the reason why  
Why we both decided we should say good-bye  
  
Nothing but good things are coming my way  
If you are going please let me stay  
You bring me down when I'm getting high  
You turn me on, I amplify  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
1-2-3, 1-2-3  
  
I won't bleed like this forever  
I'm down to ride but my wings are severed  
Blindside blitz evacuation  
I'm stuck in hell your on vacation  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
1-2-3, 1-2-3  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been waiting  
Waiting for the day  
I've been waiting  
Waiting for the day  
I'm still waiting for tomorrow  
Tired of living in yesterday  
I've been waiting  
Waiting for the day I'd be over you  
  
Oceans, devotions, these notions run dry  
Floating away and I don't know why  
Spend all my days in a bottle thinking  
You're like an anchor got me sinking  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
1-2-3, 1-2-3  
  
Say good-bye now and mean it forever  
Got to move on and keep it together  
Forget the things that you've said and you've done  
That's in the past, here comes the sun  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello tomorrow and good-bye to yesterday  
We've been waiting for this moment  
And we still don't know what to say  
We may never find the answers  
or know the reason why  
Why we both decided we should say good-bye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello tomorrow  
1-2-3  
I'd be over you (hello tomorrow)  
1-2-3  
I'd be over you
