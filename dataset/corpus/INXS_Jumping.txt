Jumping jumping  
All night long  
Jump and jump and it's up to you  
Jumping jumping

Jump and jump and we know what to do

Jump and jump and we know what to do  
  
There is no surefire way baby  
It's just the first star you see at night  
Don't walk around feeling hazy  
If you need a taste take a bite  
Take a bite  
Some day they'll catch you when you're walking  
Don't you put up no fight  
Draw back that look of confusion  
Say you don't believe in straight lines  
Straight lines
