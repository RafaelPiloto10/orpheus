Don't ever say you do  
Don't ever say you want to make me shine  
You keep your mystery, don't ever try  
To be my guiding light  
Mmm...  
  
Don't ever say you care  
Don't follow when I'm here and everywhere  
I'm blinded by your looks but there's a scent  
Of heartache in the air  
In the air...  
Hey you!  
Walk out through that door  
And into that dream  
Where I met you before  
Oh oh...  
  
Babe, you seduce me  
You take my heart and use me  
My feelings all run wild  
When you seduce me all the time  
  
Don't ever call me up  
I never wanna hear your voice again  
Oh lay your pretty hands on someone else  
Somebody who don't know you well  
Know you well...  
  
Hey you!  
Your sweet sweet talk can't stay  
And get back to that dream  
Let's both keep it that way  
Hey hey...  
  
Oh you seduce me  
You pull my heart and use me  
And I keep running blind  
When you seduce me all the time  
Mmmm... get back to that dream  
Let's both keep it that way  
Hey hey...  
Tell me once again...  
  
You seduce me  
You take my heart and use me  
My feelings all run wild  
When you seduce me all the time  
When you seduce me all the time  
You seduce me all the time  
You seduce me...
