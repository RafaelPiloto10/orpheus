Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
Here to stay is the new bird  
He sings a love song as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man  
But you can do the job when you're in town"  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
We'll go walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland, hand in hand  
We'll go walking, walking in a winter wonderland  
In a winter wonderland
