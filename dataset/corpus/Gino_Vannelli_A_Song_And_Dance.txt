Well bring on the band  
And the melody man  
Let the mockingbirds sing along  
It's a wonderful life  
And the night is young  
  
Well ladies and gents  
The gala presents  
A symphony in disguise  
It's a wonderful thing  
The clouds in your eyes  
  
I'll do my song and dance for your this night  
I'll sing you things you came to hear  
I'll do my song and dance for you this night  
I'd walk a mile to see you cheer  
  
Well life is a song  
That goes on and on  
From pittsburgh to peru  
It's a wonderful world  
Here with you  
  
I'll do my song and dance for your this night  
I'll sing you things you came to hear  
I'll do my song and dance for you this night  
I'd walk a mile to see you cheer  
  
This is my song and dance for you this night  
I've walked a mile to see you cheer
