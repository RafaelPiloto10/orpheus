I've never once in my life met someone like you  
I don't know what the word blue means  
As long as I'm with you  
You fill me so completely through everything you do  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as I'm with you  
  
Most of the time in my past  
Blue is all I knew  
But now that we're together  
O' how I love you  
I'm so glad I've found you  
You've made my dreams come true  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as I'm with you  
  
Most of the time in my past  
Blue is all I knew  
But now that we're together  
O' how I love you  
I'm so glad I've found you  
You've made my dreams come true  
Blue is not a word at all  
As long as I'm with you
