Temptation,  
Why won't you leave me alone ?  
Lurking every corner-  
Everywhere I go  
  
Self Control,  
Don't turn your back on me now  
When I need you the most  
  
Constant pressure tests my will  
My will or my won't  
My self control escapes from me still  
  
Hypocrite,  
How could you be so cruel ?  
And expect my faith in return ?  
  
Resistance,  
Is not as hard as it seems  
When you close the door  
  
I spent so long trusting in you  
I trust you forgot  
Just when I thought I believed in you  
  
("What're you doing ? What're you doing ?")  
  
It's time for me to deal  
Becoming all too real  
Living in fear,  
Why did you lie and pretend ?  
This has come to an end  
I'll never trust you again  
It's time you made your amends  
Look in the mirror my friend  
  
("That I haven't behaved as I should")  
("Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you.")  
("I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things
you can't control.")  
  
Let's stare the problem right in the eye  
It's plagued me from coast to coast  
Racing the clock to please everyone  
All but the one who matters the most  
  
Reflections of reality  
Are slowly coming into view  
How in the hell could you possibly forgive me ?  
After all the hell I put you through  
  
It's time for me to deal  
Becoming all too real  
Living in fear  
Why'd I betray my friend ?  
Lying until the end  
Living life so pretend  
It's time to make my amends  
I'll never hurt you again
