Top down on the strip, looking in the mirror  
And I'm checking out my lipstick  
Girlfriends up in the back  
We're out for a ride all night  
  
Feelin' so crazy cool, bop so righ  
Wonder what they're waiting for  
Valet baby here's the keys  
We're about to step inside  
  
Skip on the drinks head to the floor  
Making my way and that's for sure  
My body's takin' over and I want some more  
Woah Yeah Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been anticipating  
This is our song they're playing  
I want to rock with you  
You're feeling this right let's do this tonight(Yeah yeah)  
  
Step up baby don't be shy I know you're feeling me 'cause you're giving me the
eye and I-  
Don't wanny play around  
Baby watch me move  
Check this let's make a scene  
  
Don't leave me waiting alone  
Why you want to make it long playeing?  
Move it baby over here so we can set it on  
  
We can get down to the DJ sound  
Feelin' so good baby all around  
Feel it comin', got to come and get me now  
(Woah yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Gotta really let me know if you want me  
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy  
You gotta show me you've got everything that I need x2  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]
