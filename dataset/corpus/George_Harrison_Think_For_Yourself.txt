I've got a word or two  
To say about the things that you do  
Youre telling all those lies  
About the good things that  
We can have if we close our eyes  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
I left you far behind  
The ruins of the life that you have in mind  
And though you still can't see  
I know your minds made up  
Youre gonna cause more misery  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
Although your minds opaque  
Try thinking more if just for your own sake  
The future still looks good  
And youve got time to rectify  
All the things that you should  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
Do what you want to do  
And go where you're going to  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you  
  
Think for yourself  
Cause I wont be there with you
