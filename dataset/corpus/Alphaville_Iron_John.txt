If you open up the cage  
You will hurt yourself  
The king said it's forbidden  
Or you may get hell  
But the prisoner lets you know  
Where to find the key  
Under her satin pillow  
Yes, there it has to be  
Modesty is fine but it doesn't take you very far  
When you make your decision  
Don't be afraid of the dark  
Longing for the golden ball  
That it will be yours for keeps  
Be sure about it as you saw  
So shall you reap  
  
Lets take a ride on Iron John's shoulders  
He has more gold than anybody in this world  
Lets take a ride, hey-ho on Iron John  
He has more gold  
Than anybody in this world  
  
Jump on the train to nowhere  
From now on you are free  
After rising from the ashes  
You'll become a mystery  
Too many of those strange injections, too many gazes at the sun  
The lady says, well that's the business, running after No. 1  
For all their childish daydreams you caught their falling stars  
Just for the cheapest contracts you signed your autographs  
And if you started much too early, therefore you stopped too late  
Make sure no one can stop you now, here comes the ultimate  
  
Lets take a ride  
  
He will be with you, he will be there when you call out the magic words  
  
Lets take a ride
