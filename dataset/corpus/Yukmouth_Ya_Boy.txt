In a Pocanos blowin dro smoke through my nose  
Cockin' a fo' fo', my eyes half closed

In KC gettin' bigga figgas like JT  
In a Mercedes, in Houston, compin' some lady  
In a H2 sippin' on Grey Goose and grapefruit  
Smoken on catpiss ready for war like Beirut

Spreewheels keep spinnin' like a cassette when it fast fo'

One night in Australia, 2 pounds of reefer  
I tote around the heata, the fo' feva  
Shows in Costa Rica, I blow speakas  
Stuntastic ?  
You not a crook I rock jewels to make ya woman look  
In Amsterdam smoken purple cush and ?  
In Switzerland they call me swisher man  
I twist a swisher quicker then the flick of a nigga hand  
Get the picture man?

They know I'ma come back here 'cause they know the dude be real  
Of course DC knows the deal

Niggaz from everywhere tryin to do what I did  
Runnin' up askin "yo, yo who is that kid?"  
See me up in Denver, the Colorado Springs  
Where the air is fresh and it helps me when I sing  
Yo...Da...Lay... Eeh...Whoo  
Got a pussy and a titty or two?  
For ya boy, yep yep the travelin' man  
No pressure on you thug  
See I'll a snap if I can  
And off to another state  
Hurry up and clean my nuts bitch, a brotha late  
Call up my niggaz and tell 'em I made it safe up over herre
