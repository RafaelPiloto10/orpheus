If we take this bird in, with it's broken leg,  
We can nurse it, she said,  
Come inside for a little lie down with me,  
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worse thing.  
  
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder,  
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?  
And let me hold you, oh.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,  
We can lie down, so I'm next to you,  
Come inside for a little home made tea,  
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me,  
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep,  
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now,  
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love,  
You make me scream, then I made you cry,  
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
You're my little bird.
