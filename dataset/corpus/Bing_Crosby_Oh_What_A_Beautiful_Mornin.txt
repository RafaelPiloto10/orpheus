There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye,  
An' it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a beautiful mornin',  
Oh, what a beautiful day.  
I got a beautiful feelin'  
Ev'rything's goin' my way.  
  
All the cattle are standin' like statues,  
All the cattle are standin' like statues,  
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,  
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree,  
And a ol' weepin' willer is laughin' at me!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, what a beautiful mornin',  
Oh, what a beautiful day,  
I got a beautiful feelin'  
Ev'rything's goin' my way.  
Oh, what a beautiful day
