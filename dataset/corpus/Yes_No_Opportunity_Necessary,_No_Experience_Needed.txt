Step out in the night  
When you're lonely  
Listening for the sounds  
That your ears don't hear  
I know your cross is heavier  
With every step  
Every step  
But I know a man  
And he'd walk miles for you  
  
Stop, you stay where you are  
Take a look at yourself  
Take a good look at yourself  
Can tell your momma  
She'd only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life you're leading  
She won't believe  
The riches of life  
We all know  
  
Dawn turns to day  
And the dawning  
Daytime, nighttime  
And we still can't see  
Why must we wait until the morning light  
To wake up and be  
Wake up and be  
Wake up and be  
  
Step out in the night  
When you're lonely  
Listen for the sounds  
That your ears don't hear  
I know your cross is heavier  
With every step  
Every step  
But I know a man  
Who'd walk miles for you  
  
Stop, you stay where you are  
Take a look at yourself  
Take a good look at yourself  
Can tell your momma  
She'd only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life you're leading  
She won't believe  
The riches of life  
We all know  
  
Can tell your momma  
She'd only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life you're leading  
She won't believe  
The riches of life  
We all know
