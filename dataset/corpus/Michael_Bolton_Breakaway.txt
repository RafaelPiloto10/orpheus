There's something missing here and you know it  
So why deny what you've been going through  
You felt it coming though you tried not to show it  
Facing a price you can no longer pay  
It's time for a change in the plans you had made  
  
Chorus  
Breakaway, oh, breakaway  
From all your lying  
Breakaway, oh, breakaway  
From all your crying  
Before it's too late, breakaway  
  
Now you've got everything his money could buy you  
And his affection still won't satisfy you  
You need much more than his world would deny you  
Caught in a dream that could never be real  
Accepting the things you can no longer feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Caught in a dream that can never be real  
Accepting the things you can no longer feel  
  
Chorus
