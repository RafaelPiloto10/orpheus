Distant hands in foreign lands  
Are turning hidden wheels,  
Causing things to come about  
Which no one seems to feel.  
  
All invisible from where we stand,  
The connections come to pass  
And though too strange to comprehend,  
They affect us nonetheless, yes.  
  
Once again a time of change, oh,  
The change makes music  
And the children will dance  
See the pieces of the picture  
Rearrange themselves  
It feels just like a symphony to me,  
With nothing left to chance.  
Just look over your shoulder,  
It's out of you hands it's over for now.  
  
Leave behind what you can,  
You can always return  
The rhythm remains unbroken,  
Unspoken but loud and clear,  
It's a slow vibration, migration.  
  
Mystery muse, how I hunger for an answer,  
Unsung song, how I long to play the changes  
Hidden rhythm, haven't I  
Always been your dancer?  
Sacred secrets of the meaning  
To my dreaming, migration.
