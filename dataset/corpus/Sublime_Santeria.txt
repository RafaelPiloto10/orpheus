I don't practice Santeria I ain't got no crystal ball  
I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all  
I could find that Heina and that Sancho that she's found  
I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down  
  
All I really want to know  
I already know  
All I really want to say  
I can't define  
It's love that I need  
But my soul will have to wait till I get back and find  
Heina of my own  
Daddy's gonna love one and all  
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break and I got to live it out, oh
yeah  
  
I swear that I all really want to know  
All I really want to say is I got mine and I make it  
That love make it go, my soul will have to  
  
What I really want to say, ah baby  
What I really want to say, is I've got mine  
And I'll make it, yes I'm going up  
Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him  
He best go run and hide  
Daddy's got a new .45  
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat  
Believe me when I say that I got somethin' for his punk ass  
  
What I really want know, ah baby  
What I really want to say is there's just one way back  
And I'll make it, yeah, my soul will have to wait
