Out of touch, out of reach, yeah  
You could try to get closer to me  
I'm in luck, I'm in deep, yeah  
Hypnotized, I'm shakin' to my knees  
I gotta know tonight  
If you're alone tonight  
Can't stop this feeling  
Can't stop this fight  
  
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria  
Oh can you feel it, do you believe it?  
It's such a magical mysteria  
When you get that feelin', better start believin'  
Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will, ooh babe  
Hysteria when you're near  
  
Out of me, into you yeah  
You could hide it's just a one way street  
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah  
Open wide, that's right, dream me off my feet  
Oh, believe in me  
  
I gotta know tonight  
If you're alone tonight  
Can't stop this feeling  
Can't stop this fire  
  
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria  
Oh can you feel it, do you believe it?  
It's such a magical mysteria  
When you get that feelin', better start believin'  
Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will  
Ooh babe  
Hysteria when you're near  
Come on
