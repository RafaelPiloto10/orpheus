Why do I still write why do I still call  
Why do I still think there's hope for us at all  
These are the tings I hate but they're the things I do to get over you  
Sunsets make me cry old pictures make me grin  
But I don't really care to see your face again  
These are the things I say but they're so hard to do like gettin' over you  
You gotta believe that there's a reason that we surrender up our hearts  
But there's a vantage point and it takes some time to find  
Where you can see how all the pieces fit as you watch 'em fall apart  
  
Now I don't think it's right and you don't know what's wrong  
My heart keeps asking me just where do we belong  
It's not as though my life ain't hard enough to do try gettin' over you  
  
You gotta believe that there's a reason...  
  
Now other people say stop living in the past  
But when there's nothin' left it's your memory that lasts  
It's later than you think but still this isn't through this gettin' over you  
Now it's later than you think and still this isn't through this gettin' over
you
