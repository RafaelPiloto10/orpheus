When did you leave Heaven, Heaven?  
  
When did you leave Heaven?  
How could they let you go?  
How's everything in Heaven?  
I'd like to know  
  
Why did you trade Heaven  
For all these earthly things?  
Where did you hide your halo  
And where did you lose your wings?  
  
Have they missed you?  
Can you get back in?  
If I kissed you, would it be a sin?  
  
You know he's only human  
Yes, baby you're so divine, yes  
When did you leave Heaven?  
  
Angels  
Angels
