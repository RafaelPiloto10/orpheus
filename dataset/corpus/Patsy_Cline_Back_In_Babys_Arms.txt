[Chorus]  
I'm back in baby's arms  
How I missed those lovin' arms  
I'm back where I belong  
Back in baby's arms  
  
Don't know why we quarreled  
We never did before  
Since we found out how it hurt  
I bet we never quarrel anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thought I didn't need his love  
'Til he took it away  
Now I'm back where I belong  
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back in baby's arms, back in baby's arms, back in baby's arms
