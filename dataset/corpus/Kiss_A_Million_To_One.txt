Baby, now that you've made up your mind  
I'm gonna let you go, if that's what it takes to show love is blind  
I gave you the best love you ever had, but it wasn't enough  
So if you think you're so smart, go and play with your heart  
When you walk out the door, you'll realize what you never did before  
  
A million to one - that's what it will be  
A million to one - there's someone better than me  
A million to one - no, you never will find  
A million to one - another love like mine  
  
Yeah, we chose our sides and I've been misunderstood  
But everytime I try to open your eyes, I'm damned and I'm no good  
Day after day, you're further away, I can't take anymore  
So it's time that you go, but I want you to know, I won't stand in your way  
Deep in my heart I know, girl you're runnin' away  
  
A million to one  
One of these days you'll come out of your haze, no matter what you do  
It'll be too late, something good won't wait, love is runnin' out on you  
A million to one, a million to one  
  
A million to one - listen to your heart girl - a million to one - oh  
A million to one - no, you never will find  
A million to one - another love like mine  
A million to one - no, you never will find  
A million to one - another love like mine  
A million to one (repeats out)
