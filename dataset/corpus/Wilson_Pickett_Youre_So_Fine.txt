You're so fine, You're so fine, your mine  
Baby you're mine, oh yeah  
Well I walk and I talk about you  
I love you, I love you  
And I need you, Oh, by my side  
Alright, Well, I walk and I talk about you  
Well there's nothing in this world  
Sweet as your lips, you're so fine,you're so fine  
Every time we meet, my heart skips a beat  
You're my first cup of coffee, (chorus- My last cup of coffee)  
You're so fine,so fine, baby you're mine  
alright, all the time, Oh yes you is  
Well I walk and I talk about you  
Alright now, yeah, alright  
You're so fine you're so fine baby  
Oh, yeah oh oh, you're mine all the time  
Oh yeah, well I walk and I talk about you  
You know I walk, oh I talk  
Talk about you baby, one more time  
I walk and I talk, talk about you baby  
You know that I walk
