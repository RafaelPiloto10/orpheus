You and I are the best of friends I know  
And my chance to be true and never alone  
Should I fail to keep a promise to you  
Then forgive help me grow along with you  
  
Chorus:  
I love you so with my heart and soul  
I will be with you all along the way  
Like roses grow through warm and cold  
I will be with you all along the way  
  
Where you go or what you do I'll follow you  
I'll be there and be a hand to guide you through  
My little rose full of strength I'll trust in you  
We will share our burdens till one must go  
  
Chorus  
  
Rose Marie tu vois tous les bois  
Tu vois tous les dances  
C'est ton imagination Rose Marie  
Et tu dances dances dances  
Dances les bois  
Et tu dances toute soule  
En tous bois Rose Marie  
  
Chorus
