When I look in your eyes I see words I can't describe  
And these words I'm tellin' you And I tell you I love you  
Don't try to put me down just because my back is turned around  
I'm playing is strait for once cause baby I love you  
I really do there's no one else like you, Baby I love...  
  
Baby I love you No matter what you do  
Baby I love you and I tell you I love you  
Don't try to put me down Just because my back is turned around  
I'm playing it strait for once baby I love you  
I really do There's no one like you Baby I love...  
  
Cause baby I love you I really do There's no one else like you  
Baby I love you Baby I love you Baby I love you Baby I love you  
Baby I love you Baby I love... Baby I love you no matter what I do  
Baby I love you and I tell you I love you...
