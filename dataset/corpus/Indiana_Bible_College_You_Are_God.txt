[Verse:]  
You were there when the earth was without form  
When Noah's faith remained You kept him shielded from the storm  
And You were there when Job fell to his knees  
Your love shown through  
Your grace displayed in his time of need  
  
And all You are, You've always been  
And my life, my love, my all  
It rests in You  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are God in whom I put my trust  
And all I have to give I lift in worship  
You're my all, everything I need  
And every time I fall Lord there You'll be  
You are God  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You are there in the midst of all my trials  
The wounds of my life mended by the power of Your touch  
And You were there  
You died on Calvary's cross  
You gave Your life  
So willingly so we would not be lost  
  
And all I have, I give to You  
And my life, my love, my all  
It rests in You  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tag]  
You broke the chains binding me  
Took nails in Your hands for me  
You are God, You are God, You are God, You are God  
You are God  
  
You are God  
The only sovereign God  
The only living God  
Everlasting, ever loving, ever giving God
