(intro)  
Fool's gold, sparkling like the midnight sun  
Fool's gold, touch the ivory handles on my gun  
(sold out to me? ), charlatans and thieves  
(so wrong not to see? ), jokers and the priests?  
Fool's gold, stranded on a (point gloss? ) sea  
Fool's gold, nothing here and nothing to see  
(sold out to me? ), the weasels and the feared  
(and it's so wrong not to see? ), the ghosts of the disappeared  
All gone away...  
(instrumental)  
Sometimes, when I'm touched by love, by hate, or by the grace of god  
Sometimes, in the dark when hope is fading,  
Or no longer flies,  
I won't sympathize  
Spend my time getting high  
Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
Tired of living on my own, someone came and take me home  
Sometimes, this jungle life is boring, pawing,  
Ready for a feast, someone kill the beast  
Outside, streets are teeming, breathing heavy,  
Ready to explode, my brother's heavy load,  
What you reap is what you sow  
Someone came to rescue me  
Lit up like a christmas tree  
Stranded here on my own  
Someone came to take me home  
(instrumental)  
Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
When I'm out here on my own, someone came and took me home  
Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
Stranded here on my own, someone came and took me home  
(instrumental fade out)
