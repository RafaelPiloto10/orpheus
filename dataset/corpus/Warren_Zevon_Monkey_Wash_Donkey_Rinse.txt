Hell is only half full  
Room for you and me  
Looking for a new fool  
Who's it gonna be?  
It's the Dance of Shiva  
It's the Debutantes ball  
And everyone will be there  
Who's anyone at all  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?  
Left eye, right eye  
Take a look around  
Everybody's heading  
For a hole in the ground  
And it's the Dance of Shiva  
It's the Twilight of the Gods  
Thunder and lightning  
'Til the break of dawn  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Going to a party in the center of the earth  
Monkey wash donkey rinse  
Honey, don't you want to go?
