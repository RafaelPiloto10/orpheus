Slowly, softly  
Please serenade me I'm here  
Restless reviving river of life  
You are here  
  
Tell me you love me  
Tell me you see me  
Show me your laughter  
Feed me  
  
Tell me you love me  
I'm the one you need  
Raise your hand and  
Reach for me, reach for me  
  
Silent, slumber, sweetheart  
Your thunder is my thorn  
Bathing beauty ballad of bliss  
You were born  
  
Tell me you love me  
Tell me you see me  
Show me your laughter  
Oh, won't you feed me  
  
Tell me you love me  
I'm the one you need  
Raise your hand and  
Reach for me  
Oh, baby won't you reach for me  
  
Pretty precious prism in darkness  
You make me proud  
Fragile fumbling finally  
A new day we have found  
  
Tell me you love me  
Tell me you see me  
Show me your laughter  
Oh, won't you feed me  
  
Tell me you love me  
I'm the one you need  
Oh, baby won't you raise your hand  
Won't you raise your hand and  
Reach for me, yeah  
Reach for me, yeah
