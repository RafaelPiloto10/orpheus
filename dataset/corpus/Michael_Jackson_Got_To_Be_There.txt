Got to be there (got to be there)  
Got to be there in the morning  
When she says hello to the world  
  
Got to be there (got to be there)  
Got to be there in her down time  
And show her that she's my girl  
Ooh what a feeling there'll be  
The moment I know she loves me  
Cause when I look in her eyes I realize  
I need her sharing the world beside me  
  
So I got to be there (got to be there)  
Got to be there in the morning  
And welcome her into my world  
And show her that she's my girl  
When she says hello world (got to be there) (got to be there)  
  
I need her sharing the world beside me  
That's why I got to be there (got to be there)  
Got to be there where it all begins  
And that's everywhere she goes  
I got to be there so she knows  
That when she's with me  
She's home (ooh she's home) (ooh she's home) yea  
  
(Got to be there) got to be there, got to be there  
(Got to be there) got to be there, got to be there  
(Got to be there) ooh baby, baby, got to be there, got to be there  
(Got to be there) got to be there, got to be there  
(Got to be there) ooh, got to be there, got to be there  
(Got to be there) ooh, got to be there, got to be there
