Ready or not but I waste no time  
I'm headin' out with some friends of mine  
Holdin' on to what we've got  
Oh even if we're ready or not  
  
Ready or not but they're back in town  
The word is out that this time around  
They'll be lettin' go with all they've got  
Oh even if we're ready or not  
  
Rock me til I hit that floor  
Rock me til I take no more  
Rock this hungry heart of mine  
Rock me down right to the ground  
Rock me like you never done before  
Then rock me just a little more  
  
Ready or not but for all I know  
We'll be hangin' on til it's time to go  
We're always there with all we've got  
Oh even if we're ready or not  
  
Ready or not but I waste no time...  
  
Rock me til I hit that floor...
