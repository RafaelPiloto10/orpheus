He came dancing across the water  
With his galleons and guns  
Looking for a new world  
And a palace in the sun  
  
And on the shore lay montezuma  
With it's coca leaves and pearls  
In his halls he often wondered  
With the secrets of the world  
  
And the subjects gathered round him  
Like the leaves around the trees  
His coat of many colors  
For the angry gods to see  
  
And the women all were beautiful  
And the men stood straight and strong  
He offered life with sacrifice  
So that others might go on  
  
Yeah  
  
Now hate was just a legend  
And war was never known  
The people worked together  
And they lifted many stones  
  
And they carried them across the flatland  
But they died along the way  
(many lives were lost)  
Built up with their bare hands  
What we still can't do today  
(many lives were lost)  
  
And I know she's living there  
And loves me to this day  
I can't remember when  
Or how I lost my way  
Ah-oh  
Ah-oh  
Ah-oh  
Ah-oh  
  
He came dancing across the water  
Cortez, cortez  
What a killer
