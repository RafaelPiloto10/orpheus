Sun is setting, silence is all you hear  
David, getting really sick he is sweating like a pig  
The fevers got him now and Sarah's father dear  
The morning snack has put him on his back  
He should have stayed in bed, oh why didn't he?  
Sun is setting, silence is all you hear  
Salem, what's going on?  
Let me tell you a story, madame  
A secret about your land  
The reason for all this madness  
Let me tell you a story, madame  
The burial ground on your land  
Is a secret voodoo stand  
If you ever destroy this sacred place  
Legend says that you will die and never find your rest  
I'm telling the truth, oh yes, l am  
Lafayette the living can't feed the dead  
Then the dead will come for you, yeah  
You better hold your tongue now, Salem  
'Cause l don't believe in ghosts  
There is only one thing left to do now  
And that is sending of dead  
The four shadows are meeting again  
At the cemetery gates, darkness is a friend  
Midnight will soon be here  
Everything should be ready by now for sending of dead  
Place the image of Saint Expedit  
Upside down and around  
I hear, Doctor Le Croix speaking  
Let the ritual begin  
Almighty God, father of mine, come for Sarah Lafayette  
That she may be disappeared forever lost  
Saint Expedit, you are a saint and I'm a sinner  
I send you to find Sarah Lafayette  
Oh, rid me of her head and rid me of her soul  
Rid me of all her thoughts, rid me of her memory  
For this curse to work, Baron Samedi, Samedi, Samedi  
Send your blessing, so Sarah may be gone  
As if he was sent from the sky  
Baron Samedi creeps inside  
The doctor's body, speaking to Salem  
You must bring me a sacrifice  
You must come back before midnight  
Kneel before my cross, Salem is there  
He takes a handful of soil from each grave  
Of the dead he wants to send into Sarah  
Now quick, quick run back to the house  
The soil must lie where Sarah sleeps
