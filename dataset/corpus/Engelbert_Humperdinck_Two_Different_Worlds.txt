Two different worlds  
We live in two different worlds  
For we've been told  
That a love like ours could never be  
So far apart  
They say we're so far apart  
And that we haven't the right  
To change our destiny  
  
When will they learn  
That a heart doesn't draw the line  
Nothing matters if I am yours  
And you are mine  
  
Two different worlds  
We live in two different worlds  
But we will show them  
As we walk together in the sun  
That our two different worlds are one  
  
Two different worlds  
We live in two different worlds  
But we will show them  
As we walk together in the sun  
That our two different worlds are one
