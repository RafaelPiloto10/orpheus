The kids will make it happen  
We're starting a new way  
People  
In the world today  
Physically strong  
Morally straight  
Positive youth  
We"re the youth of today  
Never fight each other  
Use our heads before our fists  
Then we'll kick down all the barriers  
Of hate and prejudice  
Live fast die young was just a fad,  
For a bunch of losers  
Who didn"t take care.  
I'm gonna live my life,  
Breath every breath,  
Look towards the future  
And move straight ahead.
