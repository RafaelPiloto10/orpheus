You always come back when I'm at my weakest  
When I'm fool enough to let you in  
Sayin' how this time around is different  
Asking if I want to try again  
  
[Chorus]  
I do  
But I don't  
I want to  
But I won't  
I am  
But I ain't  
I could  
But I just can't  
It feels right  
But it's wrong  
And I've hurt way too long  
So when you ask me if I know what I want  
I do  
But I don't  
  
What resistance I have left within me  
I lose each time you're holding me this close  
With every bitter sweet kiss, girl, you tempt me  
Asking if I want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't ask me if I know what I want  
Cause I do  
But I don't
