Stranger is walking through the night  
I can't be seen cause I will fright  
You got It wrong and I got It right  
Ore else we get into a fight  
  
Well I know that I'm not fair  
'Cause I wont more and I don't care  
Come and face If you dare  
Yes I know that I won't fail oh no  
'Cause  
  
(chorus:)  
Ego, I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
Ego, I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
I can't control my ego  
  
Stranger is walking through the night  
You only see me in black and white  
Well no one pushes me around  
'Cause I'm yhe toughest guy in town  
  
Well I know that I'm not fair  
'Cause I wont more and I don't care  
Come and face If you dare  
Yes I know that I won't fail oh no  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanne be the best  
Don't care 'bout the rest  
I wanna have It all  
And I want It all now  
I don't have a boss  
And I don't fallow laws  
I don't give a damn  
'Cause I'm mo own man  
  
Chorus
