Talkin' to myself and feelin' old  
Sometimes I'd like to quit  
Nothin' ever seems to fit  
Hangin' around  
Nothin' to do but frown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
  
What I've got they used to call the blues  
Nothin' is really wrong  
Feelin' like I don't belong  
Walkin' around  
Some kind of lonely clown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
  
Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you  
Nice to know somebody loves me  
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do  
Run and find the one who loves me (the one who loves me)  
  
What I feel has come and gone before  
No need to talk it out  
We know what it's all about  
Hangin' around  
Nothin' to do but frown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
  
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do (only thing to do)  
Run and find the one who loves me  
  
What I feel has come and gone before  
No need to talk it out  
We know what it's all about  
Hangin' around  
  
Nothin' to do but frown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
Hangin' around (hangin' around)  
Nothin' to do but frown  
  
Rainy days and Mondays always get  
Me down
