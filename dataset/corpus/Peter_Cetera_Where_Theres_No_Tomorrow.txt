Didn't want to face a long hot summer  
Didn't want to spend another lonely night  
Didn't want to stay until I met you  
  
You could tell that we were made for each other  
Something in the air and the time was right  
Came into my life, oh, I can't forget you  
  
I don't want to leave tomorrow  
Yes, I said it all inside of a letter  
That I put in your hand when we walked in the sand  
Don't you understand  
  
I don't want to go where there's no tomorrow  
You go your way, I'll go mine  
Each one missing what they left behind  
  
I don't wanna go where there's no tomorrow  
Help me try to make a dream come true  
I don't wanna leave if I can't be with you  
  
Wouldn't ever change a thing for a minute  
Seems the water's always deeper when you're in it  
That's the way it goes, not the way I planned it  
  
I don't want to leave without you  
I don't want to go if you won't follow  
Told you once, tell you once again  
I don't want this summer to ever end  
Gonna be there when I can
