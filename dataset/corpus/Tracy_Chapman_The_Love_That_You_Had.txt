The love that you had  
In your heart is gone  
Any touch of sincerity  
Any trace of compassion  
What hardened your heart?  
What turned it to stone?  
What made you forget?  
You were in love with someone  
Your hands don't reach out  
Your voice doesn't call me  
I know you've stopped listening  
Your eyes look straight through me  
If nights are like this  
I'd rather be alone  
Who said you could forget  
You were in love with someone?  
Tell me what hardened your heart  
Tell me what turned it to stone  
Tell me what made you forget  
You were in love with someone  
Was I wrong to forgive  
Your indiscretions?  
Should I have been more hysterical  
Less understanding?  
If you're looking for a villain  
Go on assume the role  
But don't say that it's my fault  
That you're not in love with someone  
Tell me what hardened your heart  
Tell me what turned it to stone  
Tell me what made you forget  
You were in love with someone  
Tell me there's someone in your life  
I'll fight to keep your for my own  
Tell me because I really want to know  
Why you can't be in love with someone
