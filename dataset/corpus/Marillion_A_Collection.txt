I've got a photograph  
I took a picture of you  
I took your picture in front of my favorite view  
  
You play the part so well  
You look so sure and free  
No one could ever tell that you belong to me  
  
And 'cause you lie so well  
I've got to pin you down  
Under lock and key  
So you will always be in my collection  
  
If you can't speak you can't lie  
If you can't run, you can't hide  
I know a place you can't die  
So no one lives inside  
My collection  
  
I want to capture you  
I want to immortalize  
The way you play with your hair  
The way you flash your eyes  
  
I taste the air you breathe  
I taste the food you eat  
I keep your nails and hair  
And some of the clothes you wear  
  
If you can't speak you can't lie  
If you can't run, you can't hide  
And if you're dead you can't die  
So no one lives inside  
No one lives inside my collection  
  
I've got some photographs  
I'd like to show them to you  
Though you don't know the girls  
You'll recognize the view
