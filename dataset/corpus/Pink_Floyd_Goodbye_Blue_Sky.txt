"Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky"  
  
Ooooh  
Did you see the frightened ones?  
Did you hear the falling bombs?  
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the  
Promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue  
Sky?  
  
Oooooh  
Did you see the frightened ones?  
Did you hear the falling bombs?  
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on.  
  
Goodbye, blue sky  
Goodbye, blue sky.  
Goodbye.  
Goodbye.
