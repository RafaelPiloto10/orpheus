If I leave in silence  
Would you notice me  
Would you hate my absence  
Would you drown in your misery  
  
If I leave with a reason  
Would you argue to your grave  
Would you hold on to a promise  
Like a master keeps a slave  
  
I throw the question  
To see if you feel the same  
Because there is nothing  
I wouldn't sacrifice  
For you  
  
I am too tired to cry  
Don't you leave me to die  
I have become at peace  
As you set me free  
  
On my last confession  
The final breath I take  
Will you look me in the eyes  
And say my name  
  
the only consolation  
Is you remember me that way  
With the butterflies  
And the happy times we made  
  
I throw the question to see if you feel the same  
Because there is nothing  
To replace you
