Don't ever let me take you for granted  
You've got your finger on the pulse of my soul  
Let me place a kiss in the small of your back  
Love and protect you from the evils of this world  
  
Oh baby don't ever leave me stranded  
Whoever said that the streets were paved with gold  
Well I'm afraid that we're all sadly mistaken  
There's nothing here 'til you have someone to hold  
  
I love you with all the joy of living  
'Til the lights go down in New York City  
It's a special love affair  
And there's magic in the air  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
If love wasn't here would we reinvent it?  
Oh take me down to the very root of my soul  
Oh baby say it as if you really mean it  
And feel the passion work it's way up through your skin  
  
I love you with all the joy of living  
'Til the lights go down in New York City  
It's a special love affair  
And there's magic in the air  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
And we can go and find a brand new world  
Starlight - star bright  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
And lead you to a safe place in this world  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me 'round to my senses  
'Til I'm lost and found  
And surround me with your senses
