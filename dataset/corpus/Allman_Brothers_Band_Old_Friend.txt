You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
  
Can't you feel a cold wind, howlin' down, blowin' my song  
Can't you feel a cold wind, it's howlin' down, blowin' my song  
Well I ain't an old man, oh but you know my time ain't long  
  
Gonna be a hard rain - you can hear it in the distance, sounds so near  
Gonna be a hard rain - can't you hear it in the distance, sounds so near  
People when the rain comes, oh it's gonna wash us all away from here  
  
Mean old woman, people won't you tell me where can she be  
Mean old woman, oh people won't you tell me where can she be  
She's the only woman, oh that ever meant a damn to me  
  
You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
Tell me now old friend, when you gonna let, this poor man be?
