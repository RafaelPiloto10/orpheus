Jenny  
Jenny  
You know I'm goin' away  
And you know my woman's here  
Please don't you stray  
Watch over her  
  
You can run and bark and play  
Your whole life through  
And you can chase the cats around  
'Cause she loves that too  
If someone comes to cause her harm  
You will protect her too  
Oh Jenny  
  
Jenny  
Jenny  
You got her while I'm gone  
Time moves so slow  
For someone who's alone  
So comfort her  
  
If she's feelin' low  
You gotta be a card  
And if she's fast asleep  
Don't you sleep too hard  
If someone comes to cause her harm  
You gotta cut 'em down  
Oh Jenny  
  
Now maybe  
It's gonna be alright  
Won't have to fight  
Won't have to bite  
But then again  
So sad but true  
There's always someone waiting  
Just to shit on you  
  
And if she's fast asleep  
Don't you sleep too hard  
If someone comes to cause her harm  
You gotta cut 'em down  
Oh Jenny  
  
Now maybe  
It's gonna be alright  
You won't have to fight  
Never have to bite  
But then again  
You know it's sad but true  
There's always someone waiting  
Just to shit on you
