Looking at the clouds in the sky  
Floating image in my mind  
Land of beauty and land of peace  
Now I wonder where this place is from  
  
The evidence is everywhere  
I start to run, now I'm scared  
Strange beings all around  
Come everyone to this place I've found  
  
I'm feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries  
  
My eyes are clear and now I'm cured  
Don't you wanna be for sure?  
I know my rights I'm allowed to die  
So I'd rather swap your different guise  
  
It's in my head if you will find  
Mother love from all mankind  
You look above and then you shout  
No other way to say your head is alright  
  
Feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries  
  
I'm feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries
