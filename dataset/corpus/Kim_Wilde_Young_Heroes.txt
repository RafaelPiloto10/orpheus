Everyone round keeps putting us down, let it go  
It's the same old play in a grown up day  
It's a stinging sensation  
Hanging round on every corner  
Where, all the young kids I know want to be  
  
We only want to stay young, we only want to be free  
He doesn't want to be you, she doesn't want to be me  
We're all young heroes  
We're all young heroes  
  
Shouted down pushed and we're gettin' real bushed  
Just have your say and we'll do it your way  
If it makes you fell better  
Nothing much to add to what I say  
'cause I know just how it fells to be  
  
We only want to stay young, we only want to be free  
He doesn't want to be you, she doesn't want to be me  
We're all young heroes  
We're all young heroes  
  
We only want to be free
