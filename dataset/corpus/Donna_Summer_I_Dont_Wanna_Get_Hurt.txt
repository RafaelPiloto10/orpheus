I don't need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldn't forget self-control  
  
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing  
'Cause he said "it's more than a feeling"  
And I said "I need you too"  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a change I've got to take  
  
I don't need all my friends to remind me  
Mistakes that I've already made  
I just leave the past behind me  
And go on believing that I'll be okay  
  
Some thing are only human  
And he said he'd always need me  
And I said "I want you too"  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
Just another heartache  
I don't need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldn't forget self-control  
  
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing  
And he said "it's more than a feeling"  
And I said "I need you too"  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt
