I feel so happy, I wanna shout  
Well, tell me Bing  
Tell me what it?s all about?  
I found my one idea  
And this time I'm sure it?s real  
  
Yip yip de hootie  
Got me a beauty  
She sure is a dream  
My baby said yes  
She said yes, she said yes  
She didn't say no  
  
Cock cock-a-doodle  
You're off your noodle  
You're way off the beam  
'Cause baby said yes  
She said yes, she said yes  
She couldn't say go  
  
Knock me a daisy  
Now what would I do  
With a daisy, all day?  
You wear it and bear it  
There, you sound kinda crazy  
I'm happy that way  
  
Hi diddle diddle  
March down the middle  
And now we're a team  
'Cause baby said yes  
She said yes, she said yes  
Yes, she couldn't say no

That sure was a daisy  
That one was hazy  
But I'm happy that way
