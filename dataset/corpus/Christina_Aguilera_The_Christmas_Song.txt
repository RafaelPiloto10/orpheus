Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two, ooh ooh yeah  
Though its been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you, oh yeah, ooh ohh yeah
