Well I'm stacking up skirts and things  
Packing up and fixing to go  
For some little reason that I can't remember  
And this leavin' is a grievin' me so,  
But just one little kiss could put  
All of this leavin' behind,  
Yeah, baby me Baby and  
Maybe I might change my mind  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
Make all my blues go away  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
I'll baby you the same way.  
  
Sometimes the times are good times and  
Sometimes the times  
Are not quite so good as the good times should be  
And that's when leavin' starts to enter my mind  
But just one word from you and  
I'll put all of my suitcases down  
Yeah, baby me Baby and  
Maybe I might stick around.  
  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
Make all my blues go away  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
I'll baby you the same way.
