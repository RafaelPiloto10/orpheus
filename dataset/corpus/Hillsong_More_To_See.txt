Well, I know that I may have had my share  
Of failing and falling  
But I have come to understand  
One thing remains  
By all he's done, I have been made holy  
Worthy of serving the one  
The one who wrote eternity  
So deep in my heart  
Open your eyes and see  
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah  
You remind me still of the hope and promise  
Daring my heart to be brave  
And all the while You strengthen me  
So deep in my heart  
Open your eyes and see  
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah  
So much more  
His mercies are new every morning  
His mercies are new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
Beautifully new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
His mercies are new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
Beautifully new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
His mercies are new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
Beautifully new every day  
Open your eyes and see  
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more  
Open your eyes and see  
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Lift up your eyes and see
