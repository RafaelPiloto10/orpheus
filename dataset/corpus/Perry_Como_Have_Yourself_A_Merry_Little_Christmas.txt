Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
Merry Christmas, Merry Merry Christmas  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
All your troubles soon turn into bubbles  
  
Once again, as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Now  
  
Once again, as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Now
