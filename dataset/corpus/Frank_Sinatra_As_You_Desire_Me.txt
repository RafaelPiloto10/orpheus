As you desire me, so shall I come to you,  
Howe'er you wander, so shall I be,  
Be it forever, or be it just a day,  
As you desire me, come what may.  
I doubt not but you will do what you will with me,  
I give my life to you 'cause you're my destiny.  
And now, come take me, my soul is yours.  
As you desire me, I come to you.  
And now, come take me, my very soul is yours,  
As you desire me, I come to you.
