How many times did you call me  
And I knew it was late  
I left everybody  
But I never went straight  
I don't claim to be guilty  
But I do understand  
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand  
  
Now my heart's like a blister  
From doing what I do  
If the moon has a sister  
It's got to be you  
I'm going to miss you forever  
Tho' it's not what I planned  
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand  
  
Now the deal has been dirty  
Since dirty began  
I'm not asking for mercy  
Not from the man  
You just don't ask for mercy  
While you're still on the stand  
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand  
  
I don't claim to be guilty  
Guilty's too grand  
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand  
  
That's all I can say, baby  
That's all I can say  
It wasn't for nothing  
They put me away  
I fell with my angel  
Down the chain of command  
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand
