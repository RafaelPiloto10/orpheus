Please come to Boston  
For the springtime  
I'm stayin' here with some friends  
And they've got lots of room  
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk  
By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon  
Please come to Boston  
She said no, boy you come home to me  
  
Chorus:  
(And) She said, hey ramblin' boy  
Why don't you settle down  
(Boston, Denver, L. A.) ain't your kind of town  
There ain't no gold  
And there ain't nobody like me  
I'm the number one fan  
Of the band from Tennessee  
  
Please come to Denver  
To see the snowfall  
We'll move up into the mountains  
So far we can't be found  
And throw I love you echos  
Down the canyons  
And then lie awake at night  
Until they come back around  
Please come to Denver  
She said no boy you come home to me  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
Now that drifter's world  
Goes round and round  
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop  
But of all the dreams  
He's lost or found  
And all that I ain't got  
I need somebody I can cling to  
Somebody he can sing to  
  
He said please come to L. A.  
To live forever  
A California life alone  
Is just too hard to build  
I live in a house that  
Looks out over the ocean  
And there's some stars  
That fell from the sky  
Livin' up on the hill  
Please come to L. A.  
I just said no  
Boy, you come home to me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I'm the number one fan  
Of the band from Tennessee  
Tennessee
