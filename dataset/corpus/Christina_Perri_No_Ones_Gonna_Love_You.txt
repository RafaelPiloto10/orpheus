(Originally by Band of Horses)  
  
It's looking like a limb torn off  
Or altogether just taken apart  
We're reeling through an endless fall  
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was  
  
But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do  
No one's gonna love you more than I do  
  
And anything to make you smile  
It's a better side of you to admire  
But they should never take so long  
Just to be over then back to another one  
  
But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do  
No one's gonna love you more than I do  
  
But someone should have warned you  
When things start splitting at the seams and now  
The whole thing's tumbling down  
Things start splitting at the seams and now  
If things start splitting at the seams and now  
It's tumbling down, hard  
  
I did anything to make you smile  
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was  
I never want to hear you say  
That your better off  
Or you liked it that way  
  
'Cos no one is ever gonna love you more than I do  
No one's gonna love you more than I do  
  
They really should have warned you  
When things start splitting at the seams and now  
The whole thing's tumbling down  
Things start splitting at the seams and now  
If things start splitting at the seams and now  
It's tumbling down, hard
