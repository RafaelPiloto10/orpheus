Let the beat drop... (spoken)  
  
Boo...  
Tell me what you want me to do  
Do you want me to turn you loose  
I...  
Ain't like no other guy  
Don't play games or lie  
I'll try...  
To help you unwind  
Later you will find  
  
Hook:  
Now all I wanna do,  
Is just Kick it wit you  
And if need someone true  
Just holla at ya dude  
If you want romance,  
We can slow dance  
If you want some heat,  
We can just hit the sheets  
  
Stop...  
Playing hard to get,  
This face you wont forget  
Now,  
Or never is what going on  
Got 'til to the end of this song  
By then...  
Another girl will snatch me up  
And you'll be outta luck  
[Hook:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Why do you keep on pretending?  
You aint looking at me  
In the corner of my eyes I can see  
You want this don't let it pass  
Got to the count of three  
To leave with me  
1-2-3  
(Repeat hook until fade)
