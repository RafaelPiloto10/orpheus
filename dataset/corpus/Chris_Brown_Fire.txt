[Verse 1:]  
Her body was wooo  
By the way that she walked in  
Honey looked just like a sin  
I was mezmorized when she walked by  
Now what I'm gon' do  
Cause I gotta keep my cool  
And I ain't that type of guy  
That steps to every girl that catches my eye  
  
[Hook:]  
Belly shirt pierced navel in them heels  
From your walk and your gestures,  
What's the deal?  
So baby come over here  
What's your name  
Girl tell me everything you like  
Lil mamma don't have no fear  
Don't be scured  
Cause you know I ain't gonna bite  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby it's okay  
If you wanna rock  
Lil mamma show me what you got  
And I wanna say hey!  
Cause I'm feeling you  
Baby can you make your body move  
And I gotta say ohh lady  
Girl I wanna get to know yah  
Run up right up on yah  
Ohh baby  
You got me fired up and girl I wanna say hey  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You can call me sometime  
We can get up you and me  
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do to make you mine  
I'm gonna get it started  
Right on time  
Don't need no corny pick up lines  
I'm a whisper in your ear  
And tell you everything that you wanna hear(yeeae)  
  
[Hook:]

Got me open  
Gimmie chills
