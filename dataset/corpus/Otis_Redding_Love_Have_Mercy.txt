Love have mercy, yeah, on my soul  
How many kisses, y'all, have I stole  
From other girls they didn't belong to me  
That's why the payback is just misery, yeah  
Love have mercy, y'all, Lord  
Love have mercy on me now  
  
Love have mercy, y'all, on my heart  
For this young girl  
Is just tearing it apart  
It's got me week  
Oh don't ever let me go  
Cause I couldn't stand to reap  
What I've sown now  
Love have mercy, y'all, huh  
Love have mercy on me, yeah  
  
This feeling, Lord, is killing me  
All the things I did wasn't right  
And now I'm just sittin' like a duck  
Sittin' here on that dynamite, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
O whee, now, lord, somebody help me  
Comin' loose y'all  
  
Love have mercy, yeah, on this man  
All the wrong I did now I understand  
I broke a lot of hearts  
Before I got to her  
And now this suffering  
Just like they were, tell me 'bout it  
Love have mercy, yeah, ooh  
Love have mercy on poor me  
  
Love have mercy  
Yeah, got to tell you about it  
You got me sufferin'  
Lord, just like they were  
Don't make me suffer  
Don't make me, love have mercy on me  
Don't make me suffer, no no no no no no  
Love have mercy, mercy, mercy  
Love have mercy, mercy, mercy  
Love have mercy on me  
No don't do it to me  
You got me doin' the things  
I don't want to do, y'all, yeah  
You got me sufferin'  
Just like the girls were, now, now  
Sorry 'bout that, sorry 'bout that  
Sorry 'bout that, baby
