Hard days of work  
You had a hard day at work baby  
I want you to sit down, relax  
While I soak you in my mentals  
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo  
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears  
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair  
Soak lavender soap, coconut conditioning  
Honey lather, blood flowing, love listening  
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean  
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers sponge scrubbers  
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbin  
Diesel splash, long lovin in your oven  
Bake it off, break it off 'til it gets soft  
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off  
In and out, fragrance patience, Hershey's Kisses, Guinness Stout  
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out  
Brain message, think about pink  
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink  
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play  
Back rub, Calgon, take me away  
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish  
Comfort me through all the damn madness  
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea  
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees  
Jet skis breeze  
Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers  
Vapor action, tropical sunshower  
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour  
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug  
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug  
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance  
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace  
Complete silence, what surround us  
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets  
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites  
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats  
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail  
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails  
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells  
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell  
Violin, good medicine, sound swell  
Sunshine life, love right without the hell  
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick  
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt  
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling  
Company, ice cream licking now we holding  
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden  
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly  
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly  
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies  
Soon, taste these spoons  
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm  
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices  
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best  
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war  
Paradise life, recipe now pour  
Musicness, model, gentle mental  
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island  
Put the message in the bottle  
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty  
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty  
Yo, this is that body shop shit  
Love love slam  
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath  
Have your snack on that ass that  
Know what I mean?  
Massaging these melodies  
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf  
Blow winds, blow, through your hair  
Sea breeze sticks and shit  
Right right  
  
When your around boo  
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank-ass trick
