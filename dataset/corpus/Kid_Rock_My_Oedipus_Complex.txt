I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
I've been livin a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time  
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto lood like heaven  
  
And I believe it stems down from my family situation  
I never liked my old man  
I couldn't stand to be around him  
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin at his picture, yeah  
My heart turns to stone and I think of this  
  
I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
You never loved me, you never held me tight  
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night  
You tried to make me think that your ways were best  
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress  
  
Life it's the ultimate sin  
A game with no rules that you're expected to win  
My personal hell's hidden with a grin  
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin  
  
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool  
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool  
You should've went to school like your bigger brother  
But you played the fool with a different color  
  
Runnin' ship with a whip  
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped  
Money made you so wise  
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes  
  
Do as I say and not as I do  
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you  
And oh the pain how it hurts  
It was always your home and your business that came first  
  
You said a man is as good as his word  
But your mind was closed and mine never heard  
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured  
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard  
  
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree  
Look at you then look at me...  
  
You ain't nothin' to me you've never been to me  
And all you ever gave a damn about was money see  
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me  
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free  
  
Now I know growin' up son that it ain't always been easy  
And I know at times I was not always there for you  
No we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time  
But understand growin' up son I never had a dime  
  
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college  
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all  
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us  
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you  
  
Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so  
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so  
  
I always loved you I always cared for you  
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through  
I tried to raise my fuckin' family just the best I know  
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know  
Dah  
  
Alright, get down baby  
Yeah  
  
I need somebody won't you help me  
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am  
I need somebody please, please help me  
I need somebody you must tell me who I am  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Tell me who I am  
Hey, hey  
Tell me who I am  
I am, I am  
Tell me who I am, am, am  
Tell me  
Tell me  
  
If it looks good, you'll see it...  
If it sounds good, you'll hear it...  
If it's marketed right, you'll buy it...  
But if it's real, you'll feel it...
