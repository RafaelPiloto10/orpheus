You Make Me Feel Loved  
Every time I feel the rain  
I don't know why  
I'll never get the pain  
  
You make me feel loved  
You make me feel all loved  
  
Easy sun on a dead end street  
Nothing good can ever be so sweet  
A love we keep is a love we waste  
Make me feel loved before we are too late  
  
You make me feel loved  
You make me feel all loved  
  
You make me feel loved  
And the beautiful world and the sky is on fire  
You make me feel all loved  
Every innocent day every secret desire  
  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
(Down, down, down)  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
(Down, down, down)  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
(Down, down, down)  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
Oh, Don't let me down  
  
Lift me up, hold me close  
Give me hope now, for all of us  
Live and die in my embrace  
I move the sky across your smiling face  
  
You make me feel loved  
You make me feel all loved  
  
You make me feel loved  
And the beautiful world and the sky is on fire  
You make me feel all loved  
Every innocent day every secret desire  
You make me feel loved  
And the message you sent through invisible wire  
You make me feel all loved  
All this beautiful world and the sky is on fire  
  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
(you make me feel loved)  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time  
I wanna take a trip back in time
