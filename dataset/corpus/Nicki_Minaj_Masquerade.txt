Feel the beat of the drum  
Move like ya really wanna be number 1  
You can beat out the comp  
Run like ya really wanna be at the top  
Stop adrenaline rush 'cause  
You have been identified as a hustla'  
Topic of the discussion but beat it like a percussion  
And chuck the deuce up and tell 'em it's just love (oop-oop)  
Damn diggity-dog let them bums stay mad 'cause we livin' it up (oop-opp)  
Shelltops is on and I'm popping like, I'm popping like, I'm popping some corn  
  
And now, I don't wanna take you if we fall down, don't get upset  
And now, is just the beginning  
And we'll figure it out somehow  
Right now, masquerade  
Master the merry go round  
Right now, masquerade  
Master the merry go round  
Right now, it's something you create  
It's never ever too late  
It's never ever too late  
Right now, okay to make a mistake  
Yeah baby this is your day  
It's time to masquerade  
  
Face it, face it, full of bass in ya face  
Hit the finish line first place in the race, yes  
King Kong on ya chest  
Running and I'm coming to baton to ya left, yup  
You can be who you want  
Be who you is never be what you aren't  
Never, ever fold under pressure  
Desperate times get desperate measures (oop-oop)  
Damn diggity-dog let them bums stay mad 'cause we livin' it up (oop-oop)  
Shelltops is on, and I'm popping like, I'm popping like, I'm popping some corn  
  
And now, I don't wanna take you if we fall down, don't get upset  
And now, is just the beginning
