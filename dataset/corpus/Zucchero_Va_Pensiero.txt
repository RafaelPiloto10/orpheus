Va pensiero sull'ali dorate  
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans  
Reach the land find the place where all children grow  
Every night after listening to this lullaby  
There you find the heroes alive protecting the innocents  
Bless them all 'cause their simple song is so pure and wonderful  
Va pensiero sull'ali dorate  
Life's beautiful dream carry on for all night long  
Lead them your golden wings every feel will fly away  
Take them by the hand help them find an easy way  
Lead them back to the light back to the light  
Where they once used to belong  
Where they carry me children as long as they want  
Va pensiero sull'ali dorate  
Cross the mountains and fly over the oceans  
Reach the land find the place where all children grow  
Every night after listening to this lullaby  
Every night after listening to this lullaby
