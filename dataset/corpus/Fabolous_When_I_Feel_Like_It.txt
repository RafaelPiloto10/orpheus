I ain't in no rush  
I handle you niggas when I feel like it  
I just be chillin'  
Your bitch is chillin' too  
  
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
  
The way it's shaped they say it's fake  
I can't lie I still like it  
No snitch I can't tell if it look real and it feel like it  
She bend it over, I will hike it  
Number one pick, got skills like it  
Heard she fucks with some ball player  
When I touch down I still spike it  
Know I got that check on me  
I'm not Nike but it feel like it  
At the game in them floor seats  
I ain't Spike but I feel like it  
We ain't friends, we don't chill like it  
You ain't my dog we don't bill like it  
My nigga no camera man  
But he be flashing them steels like it  
Where I'm from it ain't Iraq  
But swear to God it get real like it  
Got soldiers in the field like it  
'Bout mine, you get killed like it  
Pussy niggas be commentating  
Say they ain't hating but it feel like it  
Just post a pic of me and his boo on Instagram  
Think he'll like it  
  
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
  
I ain't a chef I make meals like him  
Cut 'em up into thin slices  
I got bricks like constructions  
You want instructions?  
You niggas ain't built like me  
Competition ain't real like me  
I'm so sick, who ill like me?  
Two bricks in my suite  
So when I leave I bet them bitches still dyking  
Family good 'cause I feel like it  
I'm hood 'cause I feel like it  
Might not be your favorite artist  
But your favorite artist got a verse from me  
So they still like it  
Ain't nobody popping seals like me  
Codeine like a supplement  
If I make her cum it's a compliment  
Nigga fuck you, like a parking ticket  
Now I got 'caine, like a walking stick  
Shoot you for a argument  
Make all my bitches take all your bitches and play hide and get  
I'm getting rich 'cause I feel like it  
Take your girl 'cause I feel like it  
Cash her out, toss her up  
Wash her up that's the spin cycle  
And them niggas never did like it  
In the car and I got the title  
Grandma bought me a hand bible  
I bought me a hand rifle (Fire!)  
'Cause I feel like it  
All you niggas look recycled  
And I'm getting head in the car, while she's driving  
  
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, smoke one when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, pou' up when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, cash out when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it
