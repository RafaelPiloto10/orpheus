I'm bugged you all look like insects  
In your brand new sunspecs  
I'm bugged I'm bugged  
I drop a little note through my sympathetics door  
I think I'm going ga ga I just can't take anymore  
At first I see 'em swarming from a dark and midnight nest  
And when I see 'em fiddling well I think you've guessed the rest!  
  
I'm bugged you all look like insects  
In your brand new sunspecs  
I'm bugged I'm bugged  
I wake up in a cold sweat and I run into the street  
And just like in my nightmare they are jiggling at my feet  
I take a dead man's lighter and I burn them to the floor  
But where there was a dozen there are now a hundred more  
I'm bugged
