You're gone from mean street  
Each time our eyes meet, I want to touch you  
Sudden attraction, such strange reaction  
Hold me to you, then you push me away  
I want to make you, make you  
Make you want to stay  
So let me take you, take you  
Take you baby all the way  
'Cause I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
Learned all that you want, babe  
Then why don't you show, babe, don't play with me baby  
'Cause I'll find somebody who knows how to love me  
So if you want it, you better take it right now  
I want to make you, make you  
Make you want to stay  
So let me take you, take you  
Take you baby all the way  
'Cause I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
Come on and take me through the night  
You know I won't put up a fight  
Just wrap your arms around me tight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Wondered when you make me  
It might make you want to stay  
If you don't take me  
Life might never take me back this way  
I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire
