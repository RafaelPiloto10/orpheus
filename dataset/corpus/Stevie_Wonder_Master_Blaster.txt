Everyone's feeling pretty  
It's hotter than July.  
Though the world's full of problems  
They couldn't touch us even if they tried.  
From the park I hear the rhythms  
  
Marley's hot on the box  
Tonight there will be a party  
On the corner at the end of the block.  
  
Didn't know you would be jammin'  
Until the break of dawn.  
I bet you nobody ever told you  
That you would be jammin' until the  
Break of dawn  
You would be jammin' an jammin' and  
Jammin'  
Jam on.  
  
They want us to join their fighting  
But our answer today  
Is to let all our worries  
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away.  
Peace has come to Zimbabwe  
Third world's right on the one  
Now's the time for celebration  
'Cause we've only just begun.  
  
Didn't know you would be jammin'  
Until the break of dawn.  
Bet you nobody ever told you that you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's  
Of the master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of Dawn.  
I know nobody told you that you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's  
Of the master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn.  
We're jammin'  
Jammin'  
Jam on.  
  
You ask me am I happy  
Well as a matter of fact  
I can say that I'm ecstatic  
'Cause we all just made a pact.  
We've agreed to get together  
Joined as children in Jah  
  
When you're moving in the positive  
Your destination is the brightest star.  
  
You didn't know that you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn.  
I bet you nobody ever told you  
That you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn.  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin'  
Until the brak of dawn  
Don't you stop the music  
Oh no  
  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
(Repeat background)  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn  
I bet you if someone approached you  
Yesterday to tell you that you would be  
Jammin' you would not believe it  
Because you never thought that you  
Would be jammin'.  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
( We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Jammin' til the break of dawn  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You may as well believe what  
You are feeling because you feel your  
Body jammin'.  
Oh  
Oh  
You would be jammin' until the  
Break of dawn  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the  
Master blaster jammin')
