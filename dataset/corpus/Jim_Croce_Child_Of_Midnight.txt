She stood by the window and let down her hair  
Asked if I knew that I shouldn't be there  
Her lips said goodbye  
But her body said stay  
I knew I should go but I stayed anyway  
  
And they called her child of midnight  
And they say she'd love  
Whomever she find  
But when morning came I loved her  
And she stayed there in my mind  
  
She stood by the window and let down her hair  
Asked if I thought that it was right  
That she give her body and I give my mind  
I looked for an answer all the night  
  
And they called her child of midnight  
And they say she'd love  
Whomever she find  
But when morning came I loved her  
And she stayed there in my mind  
  
She stood by the window and tied up her hair  
Acted as if I had never been there  
Her lips said goodbye  
But her body said stay  
I knew I should go but I stayed anyway  
  
And they called her child of midnight  
And they say she'd love  
Whomever she find  
But when morning came I loved her  
And she stayed there in my mind
