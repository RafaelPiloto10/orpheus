We've come to bring you home  
Haven't we, Cassiel?  
  
To cast aside your loss and all of your sadness  
And shuffle off that mortal coil and mortal madness  
For we're here to pick you up and bring you home  
Aren't we, Cassiel?  
  
It's a place where you did not belong  
Where time itself was mad and far too strong  
Where life leapt up laughing and hit you hear on and hurt you  
Didn't it hurt you, Cassiel?  
  
While time outran you and trouble flew toward you  
And you were there to greet it  
Weren't you, foolish Cassiel?  
  
But here we are, we've come to call you home  
And here you'll stay, never more to stray  
Where you can kick off your boots of clay  
Can't you, Cassiel?  
  
For death and you did recklessly collide  
And time ran out of you, and you ran out of time  
Didn't you, Cassiel?  
  
And all the clocks in all the world  
May this once just skip a beat in memory of you  
But then again those damn clocks, they probably won't  
Will they, Cassiel?  
  
One moment you are there  
Then strangely you are gone  
But on behalf of us all here  
We're glad to have you home  
Aren't we, dear Cassiel?
