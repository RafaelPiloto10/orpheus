Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing  
Happy being no-one but themselves  
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes  
Who think it's very clever to be cruel to you  
  
For you were so different  
You stood all alone  
And you knew  
That it had to be so  
Avoiding ordinary boys  
Happy going nowhere, just around here  
In their rattling cars  
  
Ordinary girls  
Never seeing further  
Than the cold, small streets  
That trap them  
But you were so different  
You had to say no  
When those empty fools  
Tried to change you, and claim you  
For the lair of their ordinary world  
  
Where they feel so lucky  
So lucky, so lucky  
With their lives laid out before them  
They are lucky  
So lucky, so lucky  
So lucky, so...
