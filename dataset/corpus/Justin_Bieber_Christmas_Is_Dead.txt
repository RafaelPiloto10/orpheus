I can see  
All the children around the world  
Crying tears of deceit  
And their parents are to blame  
Christmas is dead  
And that children should cry no more  
All of it is just fake  
There's no sense to believing in  
Putting your kids health at risk  
And its causing mental illnesses around the world  
So, Christmas is dead  
And pretend its just another day  
  
Santa claus is fake  
And children will cry  
In order to admit the truth  
When you say Christmas is the perfect time of year  
I should put you to the test  
I will say  
You are careless  
That's wrong  
And you'll understand  
How the truth will set you free and change you  
Christmas is dead
