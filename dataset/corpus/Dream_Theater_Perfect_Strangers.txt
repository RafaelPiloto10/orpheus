Can you remember  
Remember my name  
As I flow through your life  
A thousand oceans I have flown  
Oh and cold  
Cold spirits of ice (ice ice)  
All my life  
I am the echo of your past  
  
I am returning  
The echo of a point in time  
In distant faces shine  
A thousand warriors I have known  
Oh and laughing  
As the spirits appear  
Oh all your life  
Shadows of another day  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers  
  
Oh oh  
  
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow  
Oh  
  
A strand of silver  
Hanging through the sky  
Touching more than you see  
The voice of ages in your mind  
Oh is aching  
With the dead of the night  
Precious life  
Your tears are lost in falling rain  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers
