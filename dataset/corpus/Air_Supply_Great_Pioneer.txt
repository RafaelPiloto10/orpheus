It happened long ago  
When I felt the need  
For a life of my own  
I dreampt of summer love  
And moving high up north  
But no one would go  
So I walked up the hill and lay there  
Imagining the day was near  
I know I want to stay there  
And be a great pioneer  
  
I made a promise then  
That I'd find a place  
Where my world won't end  
Give me a piece of land  
That will be my life  
That I will defend  
If I work really hard  
I will surely survive  
I know my virtue is strong  
No one could oppose a spirit so raw  
To be a part of the state  
To be known as a great pioneer  
I keep the fires burning  
To let you know I'm free  
My heart will always be yearning  
  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, known as a great pioneer  
  
And if it all should end  
And I hear the call  
From the great unknown  
I'll need to go my way  
Let me have my day  
Let me be alone  
  
I was dreaming here and lay there  
Knowing that my time is here  
I know I wanna stay there  
  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, known as a great pioneer
