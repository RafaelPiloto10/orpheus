Let me set the mood right  
Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright  
Let me set the mood right  
Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright  
  
I gotta set the mood right  
And that may make you feel alright  
I'm gonna set the mood right  
I promise baby you'll feel alright  
  
Just let me set the mood right  
Let me make you feel alright  
I'm gonna set the mood right  
And you'll say my name tonight  
  
If I set the mood right  
Promise girl you'll feel alright  
If you let me set the mood right  
I'll make you feel so good tonight  
  
If it feels good to you then it'll feel good to me  
Let me set the mood right  
  
[Until the end of time]  
  
Listen  
  
Woke up this morning  
Heard the TV sayin' something  
'Bout disaster in the world, and  
It made me wonder where I'm going  
There's so much darkness in the world  
But I see beauty left in you, girl  
And what you give me lets me know  
That I'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Because if your love was all I had  
In this life  
Well, that would be enough  
Until the end of time  
So rest your weary heart  
And relax your mind  
Cause I'm gonna love you girl  
Until the end of time  
  
You've got me singing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Everybody sing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Everybody singing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
  
Now if you're ever wondering  
About the way I'm feeling  
Well, baby girl, there ain't no question  
Just to be around you is a blessing  
Sick and tired of trying to save the world  
I just want to spend my time with you, girl  
And what you're give me lets me know  
That we'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've got me singing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Everybody sing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Everybody singing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
  
This one's for the lovers  
If you're out there, let me hear you say  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
This one's for the lovers  
If you're out there, let me hear you say  
Yeah, yeah  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
This one's for the lovers  
If you're out there, let me hear you say  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
This one's for the lovers  
If you're out there, let me hear you say  
Yeah, yeah  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa  
  
Cause if your love was all I had  
In this life  
That would be enough  
Until the end of time
