Fz: Carl Sanzini will now join in on the second verse of "Concentration Moon"!  
Howard: Why don't you?  
  
Concentration Moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
(Oh what A)  
Concentration Moon  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
(Carl Sanzini, ladies and gentlemen!)  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
(That's right, you heard right  
And here's one for little Carl)  
American way  
Threatened by us  
Drag a few creeps  
Away in a bus  
American way  
Prisoner: lock  
Smash every creep  
In the face with A rock  
  
Don't cry  
(No no no no)  
Don't cry  
(No no no, no-no-no no no)  
Don't cry  
(No no no no)  
Don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Don't shoot (no no no no no)  
Cop kill A creep!  
Cop want A creep!  
Kill another creep!  
Kill the fucking creep!
