This, this is not my life  
This, this is not my life  
  
This is not my face,  
This is not my place, no it's just isn't right  
  
This, this is not my life  
  
You, do you remember me?  
Remember, the way that it used to be.  
  
Do you remember our car,  
Do you remember our house,  
Do you remember what it was like  
Cause this, this is not my life  
  
[Chorus]  
My life, my life, (Now I live in the shadows)  
My life, my life, (Because you are my life)  
My life, my life,  
My life  
  
You're the only one, who can see, the real me  
You're the only one, can't you see, can't you see  
  
You took away my world  
You took away my world  
  
You took away my smile,  
You took away my life,  
You took away my reason to live  
  
You, you took away my world  
And this is not my life  
And this is not my life  
  
My life, my life, ('Cause now I live in the shadows)  
My life, my life, (Because you are my life)  
My life, my life, (And now it's endless night)  
My life, my life, (And this is not my life)  
My life, my life,  
My life, my life
