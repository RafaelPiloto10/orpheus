My name is Mud  
Not to be confused with Bill or Jack or Pete or Dennis  
My name is mud and it's always been  
'Cause I'm the most boring sons-a-bitch you've ever seen  
  
I dress in blue-yes navy blue  
From head to toe I'm rather drab except my patent shoes  
I make 'em shine, well most the time  
'Cept today my feet are troddin' on by this friend of mine  
  
Six foort two and rude as hell  
I got to get him in the ground before he starts to smell  
  
My name is Mud  
  
My name is Mud,  
But call me Alowishus Devadander Abercrombie  
That's long for Mud, so I've been told  
Told that by this sonsabitch that lies before me bloated blue and cold  
  
I've got my pride, I drink my wine  
I'd drink the finest except I haven't earned a dime in several months  
Or were it years  
The breath on that fat bastard could bring any man to tears  
  
We had our words, a common spat  
So I kissed him upside the cranium with an aluminum baseball bat  
  
My name is Mud
