Here we are  
Midair off of the cliff  
Staring down at the end again  
But then again maybe we're finally  
On the road that's heading away from all your complaining  
Of hearing the same song but baby we'll hear it when I'm gone  
  
It's time to turn on the last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
  
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared  
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
It was ours  
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again  
But then again, maybe we gave our all a song we'll never forget  
Maybe let 'em play it maybe it'll save the world  
They gonna miss her when it's gone  
  
But it's time to turn (on) up the last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
  
What if we left every moment that we could spare  
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
You'll never know when the songs gonna play  
The last song you'll hear is the one you made  
This song was beautiful that's why I started singing it  
But this song is our song is playing until the end, even if its the last song  
  
The last song  
Ooh  
The last song  
Ooh  
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared  
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear  
Ooh  
Last song
