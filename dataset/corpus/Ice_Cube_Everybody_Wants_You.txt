The Unband  
Everybody Wants You  
  
You see 'em comin'at you every night  
Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight  
You know their business, you think it's a bore  
They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before  
Get around town, spend your time on the run  
You never let down, say you do it for fun  
Never miss a play, though you make quite a few  
You give it all away - everybody wants you  
  
You crave attention, you can never say "no"  
Throw your affections any way the wind blows  
You always make it, you're on top of the scene  
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine  
Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else  
You never realize what you do to yourself  
The things that they see make the daily reviews  
You never get free - everybody wants you  
  
Everybody knows you  
Everybody snows you  
Everybody needs you, leads you, bleeds you  
  
Nights of confusion and impossible dreams  
Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams  
You got your glory, you paid for it all  
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol  
Say goodbye to conventional ways  
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days  
The more you understand, seems the more like you do  
You never get away - everybody wants you
