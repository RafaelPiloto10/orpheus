(Kid Rock) Everything I do gonna be funny  
  
New Player on the field so yield and get back  
To the wall  
'Cause I'm playin' ya all  
Like a game  
  
K-I-D is the name  
Some complain  
And they got a little fame  
And it's a shame  
  
For what its worth  
I'm down with earth  
Pourin' it on like Ms. Butterworth  
Rich and thick  
  
Kinda quick not slow  
The rhymes I fit into flow  
All in a row, from the intro  
To the end so, ho  
  
Put down the microphone and go  
Step a side as I make room to bloom  
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb  
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose  
  
Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice  
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile  
Huh, As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
  
Cramp your style (Cramp your style...cramp your style)  
  
Get down on your knees and pray when I break you  
Down with a sound  
Comin' down with a pound  
Or a bang  
  
If you can't hang with the slang  
That I exploit  
Comin' straight from Detroit  
Rough without a doubt or a question  
  
Kid Rock here in the flesh  
And addressin' and defining certain issues  
To diss you (he diss me..aheo)  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
  
You can't hide so don't be surprised  
When I dismiss you from your throne  
And send you home  
As a Kid Rock clone  
  
'Cause I can hold my own  
Like ya hold a milkbone  
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit  
So when I hit the skit  
  
That's it  
So don't come in face with the base  
And remember your just an imitation  
Don't get buckwhile  
  
In fact don't smile  
'Cause I'll pull your file  
As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
  
Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style)  
I'll claim the boundries of my domain  
Detroit...Detroit  
Fresh, I'm from the Midwest  
  
From MoTown...From MoTown  
  
I'm like steel or concrete yo cause I'm the hardest  
Down with a label known to be the largest  
Not bein modest don't even think of tryin to hang  
'Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O  
  
I roll thick  
I roll heavy  
D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady  
So get ready to feel the pain  
  
I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane  
So listen rappers and get to the program  
Breakin' ya down is the Kid rock slogan  
And any rapper who thinks about dissin'  
  
You know what I'll say?  
I got a great big dick  
So anyone who can't adjust  
Gets rust  
  
And then bites the dust  
Be ready to walk a mile  
'Cause I'll smack that cool-Aid smile  
As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style)
