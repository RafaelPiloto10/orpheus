(coverdale)  
If I could see before my time ends  
The smile you gave me before the pain  
I could accept the world of darkness  
Never see the sun again...  
Never ever gonna leave ya,  
So dry your eyes and smile again  
Say the words I need to hear...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
Say that you need me,  
I can't take it anymore...  
But I know I must be strong,  
To keep belive in right or wrong...  
I've got time but I can't wait too long  
Wanna get you home where you belong...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
I can't take it anymore...  
Say you love me, baby, baby, baby  
Say you love me...  
Say that you need me, I can't take it anymore...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
I can't take it, I can't take it anymore...  
Say you love me, oh baby  
Say you love me...  
Say that you need me, I can't take it anymore...  
I can't take it anymore...
