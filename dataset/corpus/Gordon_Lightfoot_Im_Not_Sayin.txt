I'm not sayin' that I love you  
I'm not sayin' that I'll care if you love me  
I'm not sayin' that I'll care  
I'm not sayin' I'll be there when you want me  
  
I can't give my heart to you  
Or tell you that I'll sing your name up to the sky  
I can't lay the promise down  
That I'll always be around when you need me  
  
Now I may not be alone each time you see me  
Along the street or in a small cafe  
But still I won't deny or mistreat you  
Baby if you let me have my way  
  
I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry  
For all the things that I might say that make you cry  
I can't say I'll always do  
The things you want me to  
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try  
  
Now I may not be alone each time you see me  
Or show up when I promised that I would  
But still I won't deny or mistreat you  
Baby if you love me like you should  
  
I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry  
For all the things that I might say that make you cry  
I can't say I'll always do  
The things you want me to  
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try  
I can't say I'll always do  
The things you want me to  
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try
