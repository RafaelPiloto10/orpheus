Daybreak.  
How can I ever leave this place beside you?  
You were the only one I ever cried to.  
The night is through.  
  
Now it's heartache.  
I got to get home before he sees it's daybreak.  
Light from the sky is shining through the curtain lace.  
I never really meant to stay.  
  
And now it's daybreak.  
We were just sitting and talking.  
Oh, who would have thought we'd be spending the night  
Dreading the light of daybreak?  
  
How can I leave this place beside you?  
How can I leave you, baby, leave you?  
I don't want to go.  
  
And now it's daybreak.  
We were like storybook children.  
Hey, but, like all good fairy tales, this one must end.  
Here is the end. It's daybreak.  
  
How can I ever leave this place beside you?  
You were the only one I ever cried to.  
The night is through.  
  
Lord knows it's daybreak.  
And it feels like heartbreak.  
I don't want to leave you,  
I don't want to leave you, I need you!  
Looks like it's daybreak,  
But it feels like it's heartache.  
I don't want to leave you,  
Don't make me leave you, I need you!  
Daybreak.  
Sunlight shining through the lace.  
I need you.  
Sun is smiling on your face.  
I need you.  
Don't make me leave you!  
Lord!
