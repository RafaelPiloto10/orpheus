They cry in the dark  
So you can't see their tears  
They hide in the light  
So you can't see their fears  
Forgive and forget  
All the while  
Love and pain become one and the same  
In the eyes of a wounded child  
  
Because hell, hell is for children  
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess  
Hell, hell is for children  
And you shouldn't have to pay for your love  
With your bones and your flesh  
  
It's all so confusing this brutal abusing  
They blacken your eyes and then apologize  
"Be daddy's good girl, and don't tell mommy a thing"  
"Be a good little boy, and you'll get a new toy  
Tell grandma you fell from the swing"  
  
Because hell, hell is for children  
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess  
Hell, hell is for children  
And you shouldn't have to pay for your love  
With your bones and your flesh  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Hell, hell is for hell  
Hell is for hell  
Hell is for children  
  
Hell is for children  
Hell is for children
