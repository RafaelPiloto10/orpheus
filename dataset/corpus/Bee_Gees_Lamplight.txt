Alons, viens encore, cherie.  
J'attendrai patiemment sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue.  
  
Then I may end.  
She had things to buy.  
I close my eyes.  
Yet I don't know why.  
I gave her money, said she knew someone.  
And she said she won't be long.  
  
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning.  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine.  
  
I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed.  
Then saw your face in an old photograph.  
I didn't think that I could live without you but what am I to do ?  
  
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning.  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine  
  
Come home again dear.  
I have waited year after year  
Under the lamp in our old avenue.  
If all in the world that's laughing, why should it make us cry?
