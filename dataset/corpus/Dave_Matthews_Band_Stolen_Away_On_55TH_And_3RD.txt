Hello again  
Seems like forever between now and then  
You look the same  
I mean you look different but you haven't changed  
Funny to think how the time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
  
Stole me away  
First time I saw you you did me that way  
What should I say  
I saw you laughing and I was afraid  
I might get in the way  
  
I did not think I would see you again  
So how have you been  
Do you remember...  
And  
How's everything  
Funny I think how time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
  
Stole me away  
First time I saw you you did me that way  
What should I say  
Saw you there dancing but I was afraid  
I might get in the way  
  
I did not think I would see you again  
Funny to think how the time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
Funny the feeling when forever ends  
You stole me away  
First time I saw you you did me that way  
What should I say  
Saw you there dancing but I was afraid  
I might get in the way  
  
Never thought I would see you again  
So how have you been  
Watching the years as they trickle away  
It's everything  
How the time gets away  
Funny how you take me right back again  
  
Steal me away  
  
It's like the first time I saw you you do me that way  
What should I say  
I see you here standing and I am afraid  
I might get in your away  
  
I never thought I would see again  
How have you been  
Do you remember I mean everything  
You steal me away  
Like the first time I saw you  
You do me that way  
What can I say  
I see you standing here and I am afraid  
I might get in your away
