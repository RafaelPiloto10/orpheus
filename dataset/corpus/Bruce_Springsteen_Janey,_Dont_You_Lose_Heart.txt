You got your book baby with all your fears  
Let me honey and I'll catch your tears  
I'll take your sorrow if you want me to  
Come tomorrow  
That's what I'll do  
Listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Well you say you got no new dreams to touch  
You feel like a stranger babe who knows too much  
You come home late and get undressed  
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness  
Well listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Till every river it runs dry  
Until the sun's torn from the sky  
Till every feel you've felt burst free  
Gone tumblin' down into the sea  
Listen to me  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart  
Janey don't you lose heart
