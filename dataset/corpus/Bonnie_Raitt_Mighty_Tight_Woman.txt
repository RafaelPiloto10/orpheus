I come to you, sweet man  
And I'm, I'm fallin' on my knees  
I come to you, pretty papa  
Fallin' on my knees  
Ask if you don't have nobody  
Won't you kindly take me please  
Cause I'm a mighty tight woman  
I'm a real tight woman  
Lord I'm a jack of all trades  
I can be your sweet woman  
Also be your slave  
Lord I can do things so good  
You will swear that I behave  
I got all of them sayin'  
That I'm tight in everything I do  
I got all the men cryin'  
I'm a broad that will never be blue  
What I need is a good man  
And I will make him happy too  
If you're a married man  
You ain't got no business here  
Cause when you're out with me  
I might make your wife shed a tear  
Cause I'm a mighty tight woman  
There is nothing, nothing that I fear
