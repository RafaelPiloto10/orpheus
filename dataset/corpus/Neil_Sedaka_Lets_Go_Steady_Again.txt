Dum dum dum rat oh too, let's go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too, let's go steady again  
Let's go steady again like we did before  
Let's go steady again and be lovers once more  
Wear the ring around your neck like you used to do  
Don't you know it's wrong to break up  
C'mon baby let's kiss and make up  
Let's go steady again, like in the past  
Let's show all of our friends that our love can last  
I don't care of who was wrong  
Come back here where you belong  
C'mon baby let's go steady again  
Monday...we said goodbye  
Tuesday..all we did was cry  
Wednesday.I almost lost my mind  
Thursday...I was feelin blue  
Friday..was the same way too  
Never had a day, sad as Saturday  
Even Sunday was no fun day  
Let's go steady again like we used to do  
Say you're ready and then we can start anew  
Seven days we didn't speak it's been a long and lonely week  
C'mon baby, let's go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too, let's go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too, let's go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too, let's go steady again
