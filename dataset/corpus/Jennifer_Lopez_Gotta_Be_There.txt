(I wanna be where you are)  
(Could it be I stayed away too long?)  
  
I remember I said we should split  
Had a lot goin' on And you weren't part of it  
You tryin' to reason with me I admit  
But I did  
And now I'm walkin' around so so sick  
And now I'm thinkin' for you that's a fact  
Got me missin' you Like LA misses Shaq  
What I gotta do  
On my mission to get you back  
Because I'm just that way without you  
Baby baby I  
  
Really didn't mean it  
When I said it, I'll repeat it  
I was trippin' flippin' out It was nothin'  
I was on a whole other level  
Now I got it all together  
I was sick, but now I'm better  
I was trying to push you away  
Really wanted you to stay  
Didn't know that was the case  
It was just plain crazy 'cause around here lately  
Been thinkin' about nothing but my baby  
  
If you're in Houston, Hosted in Atlanta  
(I wanna be where you are)  
  
Chillin' in New York  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
  
If you're in Chicago Hangin' out in the MIA  
(I wanna be where you are)  
  
Maybe you can be in LA  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
I just wanna be your lady  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
  
(I wanna be where you are)  
(Could it be I stayed away too long?) 2x  
  
What's gone is gone  
And I wanna take it back  
I'm not livin' in the past  
But now I want you back  
Gotta get you, gotta get you here  
I been looking for you everywhere  
Everywhere, baby  
I'd apologize 1000 times to you if I could prove (prove)  
Baby I'm wrong and out of breath  
I been around the world tryin' to get to you  
  
Really didn't mean it  
When I said it, I'll repeat it  
I was trippin' flippin' out It was nothin'  
I was on a whole other level  
Now I got it all together  
I was sick, but now I'm better  
I was trying to push you away  
Really wanted you to stay  
Didn't know that was the case  
It was just plain crazy 'cause around here lately  
Been thinkin' about nothing but my baby  
  
If you're in Houston, Hosted in Atlanta

If you're in Chicago Hangin' out in the MIA  
(I wanna be where you are)  
  
Maybe you can be in LA  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
I just wanna be your lady  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
  
(I wanna be where you are)  
(Could it be I stayed away too long?)  
( OOohhhh OOohhhh OOohhhh OOohhhh)  
(Could it be I stayed away too long?)  
  
repeat
