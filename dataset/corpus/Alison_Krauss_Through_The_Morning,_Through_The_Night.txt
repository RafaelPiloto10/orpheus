Believe me when I tell you  
I will try to understand  
Believe me when I tell you  
I could never kill a man  
  
But to know that another man's holding you tight  
Hurts me, little darling  
Thru the morning thru the night  
  
The bond has been broken  
The promise you gave  
The words that were spoken  
I can not be your slave  
  
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone  
Hurts me, little darling  
Through the nighttime through the dawn  
  
I dreamed just last night you were there by my side  
Your sweet loving tenderness  
Easing my pride  
  
But then I awoke and found you not there  
It was just my old memory of how much I care  
  
Believe me when I tell you  
I will try to understand  
Believe me when I tell you  
I could never kill a man  
  
But to know that another man's holding you tight  
Hurts me little, darling  
Through the morning through the night
