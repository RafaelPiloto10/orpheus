It's all right  
Everything is fine  
You live the perfect life  
Never one immoral thought inside your mind  
  
What they say  
Does it make you feel ashamed?  
Isn't everyone the same?  
Does it matter that it wasn't your idea  
God is a man  
You know for certain  
The knowledge in and of itself  
Is more than we deserve  
  
So you've tried  
And you've made up your mind  
Something's still not right  
The devil you don't know is still outside
