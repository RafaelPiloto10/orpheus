I'd like to put to rest the rumours  
I'd like to put to rest the lies  
I'd like to throw away the past  
And show you how I feel inside  
  
I'll be your taxi and your driver  
I'll be your road if you need  
I'd like to push and push and push  
Just to make you pleased  
  
But your river of emotion for me  
flows like a dried up stream  
  
[Chorus]  
So tell me why  
Your satisfaction's like a heart of stone  
So tell me why  
Your love reaction chills me to the bone  
  
You make my blood boil hot  
And my heart beat like a drum  
I'd like to do to you girl  
Things that ain't never been done  
  
From the rain I'll be your shelter  
From the cold I'll be your heat  
I'll push and push and push  
just to make you pleased  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So tell me your reason  
for tearing me up inside  
Girl you gotta tell me why  
  
But your river of emotion for me  
flows like a dried up stream  
  
[Chorus]
