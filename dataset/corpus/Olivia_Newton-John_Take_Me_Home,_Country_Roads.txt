Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
  
Almost heaven,West Virginia  
Blue Ridge Mountain,Shenandoe River  
Life is old there,older than the trees  
Younger than the mountains  
  
Growing like the breeze  
Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
  
Take me home,country roads  
All my memories gather round her  
Mine is lady,stranger to blue water  
Dark and dusty painted on the sky  
  
Misty taste of moonshine  
Teardrop in my eye  
Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
I hear her voice in the morning  
Now she calls me  
  
The radio reminds me of my home far away  
And driving down the road I get a feeling  
That I should've been home yesterday,yesterday  
Country roads,take me home  
  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
Country roads,take me home  
  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
Take me home,country roads
