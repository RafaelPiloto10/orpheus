What a life what a day I'm in love all the way  
I'm in good with lady luck ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
I'm in love ah hah I'm in love oh yeah  
Well I feel like I was hit by a truck ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
  
Well true love came just in time, in time to save this heart of mine  
Cupid came and I forgot to duck ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
I'm in love ah hah I'm in love oh yeah  
Well look at me grin and watch me strut ah hah baby I've a been lovestruck  
  
Well... It's a great life everything's O.K.  
But there's one or two things I forgot to say  
I'm glad that I met lady luck, I'm glad that I forgot to duck  
And I'm glad that I've been lovestruck
