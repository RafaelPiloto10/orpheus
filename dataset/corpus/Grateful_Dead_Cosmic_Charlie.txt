Cosmic Charlie how do you do  
Truckin' in style along the avenue  
Dum de dum de do da lee do  
Go on home your mama's calling you.  
  
Calico Cal, ya come tell me the news  
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her  
Rosey red and electric blue  
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe.  
  
Say you'll come back when you can  
Whenever your airplane happens to land  
Maybe I'll be back here too  
It all depends on what's with you.  
  
Woke up waiting for a windy day  
Cat on I ? since the first of February  
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow  
But standing here I say I just don't know.  
  
New ones come in as the old ones go  
Everything's moving here but much too slowly  
A little bit quicker and we might have time  
To say how do you do before we left behind.  
  
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo  
The very last lately inquired about you  
It's really very one or two  
The first you wanted the last I knew.  
  
I just wonder if you shouldn't feel  
Less concerned about the people unreal  
The very first word is how do you do  
The last go home your mama's calling you.  
  
Calling you oh, oh, oh, oh, h,  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Calling you oh, oh, oh  
  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Go on home your mama's calling you  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Go on home your mama's calling you  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Go on home your mama's calling you  
Go on home your mama's calling you
