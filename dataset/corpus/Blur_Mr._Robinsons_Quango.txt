Oh, Mr Robinson  
And his quango  
Dirty dealer  
Expensive car  
Runs the buses and the Evening Star  
He got a hairpiece  
Ooh, he got herpes  
His private life is very discreet  
A nicer man, no, you're never gonna meet  
  
He's the self-confessed saviour of the dim right wing  
He got respiratory problems and a mason's ring  
  
Oh, Mr Robinson  
And his quango  
Drinks with generals and county wives  
The family business is doing alright  
They're doing tangos  
Down in the quangos  
He makes them tick  
Ooh, he makes them tock  
And if you don't fit  
He put you in the dock  
  
He just sits in his leather chair and twiddles his thumb  
Gets his secretary in and pinches her bum  
He ran into the toilets in the town hall  
He got his biro out and wrote on the wall  
"I'm wearing black French knickers under my suit  
I've got stocking and suspenders on  
I'm feeling rather loose"  
  
Ooh, I'm a naughty boy  
Ooh, I'm a naughty, naughty boy
