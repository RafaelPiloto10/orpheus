Nothings gonna change your head, you wouldn't let it  
Nothings gonna change your mind  
You just wanna let ahead and you can't forget it  
Leaving all the best behind  
Take a look at yourself in the mirror  
You'll find, you'll find  
  
[Chorus]  
(Hearts in trouble)  
It's hard to tell when you're losing touch  
You can't find love when you got so much  
(Hearts in trouble)  
Don't you know that I'll be there for you  
Turn around and see what love can do for you  
  
Somethin' gettin' in your way, you can't shake it  
It's never gonna let you go  
Running from your yesterday, you won't make it  
If you never let it go  
  
All the things that you need,  
You've been leaving behind  
Soon your heart's gonna bleed,  
You've been losing your mind, you can't hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never know what you got  
Till it's moved down the line  
Take a look at yourself in the mirror,  
You'll find, you'll find  
  
Hearts in,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somethings gonna turn your head, you're gonna get it  
Somethings gonna change your mind
