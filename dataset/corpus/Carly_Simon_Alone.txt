My goin' has nothing to do with you  
I'm planning a trip all alone  
And all I want is a room with a view  
Where the sight of the sunset full blown  
Makes me ache with feeling alone.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'll think about you there  
If I do some thinkin'  
And I'll care about you there  
As it's love I've know  
It's not to leave you that I'm goin'  
I'm just goin' to be alone  
  
It seems that I'm hearing those noises again  
The voices, once small, now have grown.  
Flashbacks keep sending me way back to when  
The sounds of the waves on the stones  
Make me ache with feelin' alone  
  
[Chorus]
