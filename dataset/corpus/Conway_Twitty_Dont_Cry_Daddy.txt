Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing around my head  
My pillow still wet  
From last nights tears  
And as I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Keeps crying out  
And ringing in my ears.  
  
Don't cry daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me, Jimmy and Johnny  
Together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry.  
  
Why must children be the first  
To feel the pain and hurt the worst  
It's true somehow it don't seem right  
And ev'ry time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so  
I wonder will it be the same tonight?  
  
Don't cry daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me, Jimmy and Joni  
Together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy ride us on your back again.  
  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry  
Well daddy, please don't cry
