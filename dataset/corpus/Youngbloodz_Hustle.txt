Yea, youngbloodz, kill the mic, track boys  
Why'all ain't ready for this shit,  
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea  
  
OK we back and bumping, youngbloodz that's us for sure  
From left to right we rocking and kicking down every door  
Watch out now get 'em shawty, oh that's them you-way boys  
We set it off don't get twist it still out making noise  
Big pistol that's my word, ice cold is so superb  
3 hits 4 shots I'm on it, running you up off the curb  
So bring your A-game, we bringing hella pain  
You disrespect my sip ill pop your back like pootytank  
So if your ready run it, we got that shit that will  
I'm from Atlanta steady bouncing blowing off the grill  
Cause in the trunk its bumping, we going all night long  
So grab a cup 'cause ain't no way in hell you goin home  
  
[Chorus]  
I won't get my crime around  
I hustle baby  
I stay down every time no day  
I hustle baby  
From the track or the trap fo sand  
I hustle baby  
No day I hustle baby no day gotta hustle baby  
I won't get my crime around  
I hustle baby  
I stay down every time no day  
I hustle baby  
From the track or the trap for sand  
I hustle baby  
No day I hustle baby no day gotta hustle baby  
  
I'm a crime time hustler man, I tried to tell 'em  
My crew 'cause its the ex-convict, convicted fellon  
Banana clips bazmellons of all these stitches telling  
The bitches of bazballers and secrets of shotcallers  
Of better rounds of scopping he said lue a-town to Oakland  
Niggas praying and hoping, they don't get caught with dope and  
Out a catin' and a cripping in Chicago they folking  
Down south we got 36 oles traping and focus  
This is no hocus pocus, play the game like locus  
Players vibe up and whittin' I'm the third cosmoses  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My pimping is old school, and they Chevy with bleak shoes  
Tip tops and flip flops, Adidas and suede pumas  
Who nigga fo like why'all they never going change that  
They slang goin where I hang and my bitches they who'd-a-rest  
And we all drink do-duces of dat go for 5  
We'll put that hot heat like between your eyes  
And I keep it under the seat in the summer they sweating me  
Coming down your street with beat sitting on some chesly feet  
Outta town in that's gold rims, for shawty be serving them  
Everytime my Chevy stop my rims they still spin  
A-town for life why'all we never going change that  
Still roll with them dope boys on the bow with them J's at  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
