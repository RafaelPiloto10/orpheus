There was Adam  
Happy as a man could be  
'Til Eve got him messing  
With that old apple tree  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
Lot took his wife  
Down to the corner for a malted  
She wouldn't mind her business  
Boy, did she get salted  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
Samson thought Delilah  
Was on the square  
'Til one night  
She clipped him all his hair  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
From our history books  
We all learned  
Nero fiddled  
While Rome was burned  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
Marie Antoinette met  
Some hungry cats at the gate  
They was crying for bread  
She said, "Let them eat cake"  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
You can buy a woman clothes  
And give her money on the side  
No matter what you do  
She ain't never satisfied  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time
