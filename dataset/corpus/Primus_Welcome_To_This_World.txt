Oh, welcome to this world of fools  
Of pink champagne and swimming pools  
Well, all you have to lose is your virginity  
Perhaps we'll have some fun tonight so stick around and take a bite of life  
We don't need feebleness in this proximity  
  
Ask good MacDuff and Donalbain, so many good ideas are slain  
By those who would dare not step out of line  
But if I have my way tonight and chances are I think I might-  
I'll turn those sour minds to grapes of wine  
  
Welcome to this world  
  
Don't judge the boy by what you hear  
The words are heard beyond the ear  
The heart and mind are focus for this conversation  
But be abound in mystery for that so much you do to me  
For there are those who drown in adulation  
  
Welcome to this world  
  
If I had a dime for each time that I heard them preach  
Well I'd have wicked thoughts upon my brain
