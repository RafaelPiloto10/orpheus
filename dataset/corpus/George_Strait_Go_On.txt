I'm so sorry, I keep interrupting  
What were you gonna say  
You caught him cheating, I don't blame you  
For walking away  
I know where you're coming from, it sounds like where I've been  
Oh there I go interrupting your story once again.  
  
Go on, go on  
You were saying how a fool can only fool you so long.  
It's true, it's so true  
When they do you like that, what else can you do  
But go on  
  
Our conversation won't change nothing,  
But it's sure nice to talk  
With somebody whose been cut of  
The same old cloth  
You know how you said happiness can't be found looking back  
If you don't mind maybe we can talk a little more about that.  
  
Go on, go on  
You were saying this is better than sitting at home.  
It's true, it's so true  
When they do you like that, what else can you do  
But go on  
  
Even when you see no reason to  
Don't wait to live life cause it won't wait for you.  
  
Go on, please go on  
You were saying what don't kill us only makes us strong  
It's true, that's so true  
When they do you like that what else can you do  
But go on,  
Just go on,  
Life goes on,  
And on.
