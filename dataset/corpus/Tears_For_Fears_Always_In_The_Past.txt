Money can't change the way you feel  
Smoke stains on your fingertips  
Made for life is no big deal  
When there's something behind you that just doesn't fit  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I can't stop thinking  
Always in the past  
No, no, I just can't stop thinking  
Always in the past  
It was always in  
  
Smoke screens up at the break of day  
Boy you must had a lonely night  
And did your dreams reveal God's plan?  
Did heaven say you're gonna make it alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Walk those streets  
Paved with gold  
You and I we are one and the same  
We've got a whole lot of soul  
Dance those steps  
Of the ancient plague  
You could sharpen knives on the famous lives  
That were never saved  
  
[Chorus: x2]
