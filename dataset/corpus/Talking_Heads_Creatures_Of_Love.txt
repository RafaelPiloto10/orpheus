A woman made a man  
A man he made a house  
And when they lay together  
Little creatures all come out  
  
Well, I've seen sex and I think it's alright  
It makes those little creatures come to life  
I can laugh or I can turn away  
Well, I've seen sex and I think it's okay  
  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
From the sleep of reason, a life is born  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
  
It's okay to be afraid  
When the blue sparks hit your brain  
We can love one another  
I've been told that it's okay  
  
Doctor, doctor, tell me what I am  
Am I one of those human beings  
Well I can laugh or I can learn to think  
So help me now to find out what I feel  
  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
We've been here forever, before you were born  
We are creatures of love, We are creatures of love  
  
A man can drive his car  
And a woman can be a boss  
I'm a monkey and a flower  
I'm everything at once  
  
Well, a woman and a man can be together  
If they decide to they'll make little creatures  
Watch 'em now!  
Little creature of love  
With two arms and two legs  
From a moment of passion  
Now they cover the bed  
  
We are creatures of love, we are creatures of love  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
We are creatures, creatures of love  
From the sleep of reason, a life is born  
We are creatures of love, we are creatures of love
