JAMAICA FAREWELL  
Harry Belafonte  
  
Down the bay where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
  
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way  
Won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down, my head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Down the market you can hear  
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear  
'Akey' rice, salt fish are nice  
And the rum is fine any time of year  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the dancing girls sway to and fro  
I must declare my heart is there  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico
