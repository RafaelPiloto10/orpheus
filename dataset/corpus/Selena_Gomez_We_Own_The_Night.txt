Is it alright, if I'm with you for the night  
Hope you don't mind, if you stay by my side  
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark  
Pull over and watch the stars  
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think  
As long as I'm with you  
  
[Chorus]  
When we are together its the time of our lives  
We can do whatever, be whoever we'd like  
Spend the weekend dancing 'cause when we sleep when we die  
Don't have to worry about nothing  
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh)  
We own the night!  
We own the night  
We own the night  
  
It's all a blur,  
It's getting late but I don't care  
I don't know where we'll end up  
And that's okay  
  
We can drive in your car, somewhere into the dark  
Pull over and watch the stars  
We can dance, we can sing, do whatever you think  
As long as I'm with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing lasts forever  
Let's live it up when we're together  
Nothing lasts forever  
So let's live it up, just do whatever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When we are together its the time of our lives  
We can do whatever, be whoever we'd like  
Spend the weekend dancing cause when we sleep when we die  
Don't have to worry about nothing  
We own the night! (ah-ah-oh)  
  
(Just do what you like)  
(Ah-ah-oh) We own the night!  
(Do whatever you like)  
(Ah-ah-oh) We own the night!  
(Just do what you like)  
(Ah-ah-oh) We own the night!  
(Do whatever you like)
