Oh, the days are gettin' brighter  
Yeah, I'm a lucky man  
Got the smile comin' on  
Reach out and shake my hand  
Cause just to see you in the morning  
Well, honey it makes me smile  
That you keep on keepin' on  
Get me down off of this here  
I can't feel, it's not too clear  
And how I worry when you're not near  
But it's all so easy  
Yes, it's all so easy to please, babe  
Life's gonna be my pleasure  
If I can only get enough  
But I feel it all up around me  
And the pain gets so rough  
If you come right here and love me  
You know I'll make it true  
That you keep on keepin' on
