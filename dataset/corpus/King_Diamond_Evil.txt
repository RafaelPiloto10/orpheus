I was born on the cemetery  
Under the sign of the moon  
Raised from my grave by the dead  
I was made a mercenary  
In the legions of Hell  
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane  
  
You know my only pleasure  
Is to hear you cry  
I'd love to hear you cry  
I'd love to feel you die  
And I'll be the first  
To watch your funeral  
And I'll be the last to leave  
I'd love to hear you cry  
  
And when you're down beyond the ground  
I'll dig up your body again  
And make love to shame  
Oh lady, cry, and say goodbye  
Oh lady, cry, and say goodbye  
  
You've gotta say goodbye  
'Cause I will eat your mind
