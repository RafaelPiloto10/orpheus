This is what I wanna live for  
This is where I wanna live  
To give my life to you and to this feeling  
That's alive today  
And never let it go away  
No matter what this is  
  
This is, and how can I deny it  
This is, and will not be denied  
And you don't have to give an explanation  
For the way you feel  
I only wanna know it's real  
No matter what this is  
  
To give my life to you and to this feeling  
That's alive today  
And never let it go, never let it go away  
No matter what this is  
No matter, no matter what this is  
It's everything that is
