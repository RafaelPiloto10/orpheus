In my dreams I wish that I could see  
A paperboy just hanging from a tree  
  
I don't care if you're nice to me  
We'll never meet again  
And everybody cares so much  
But I don't give a damn  
  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day  
  
Every night when I go back to bed  
My evil thoughts are spinning in my head  
  
I don't care if I'm right or wrong  
I don't care if you're mad  
Cause everybody cares so much  
But I don't give a damn  
  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day  
  
Solo  
  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day
