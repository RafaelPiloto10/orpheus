Woah, woah  
How my eyes adore you  
As you walk into the room  
  
Anytime you're feeling lonely  
Like a ship without a sail  
Anytime that I fall and stumble  
Be my rock where others fail  
  
Anytime that you're feeling lonely  
Come along and be mine only  
All it takes is a little trying  
Please don't you leave me crying  
  
He don't want to know  
Just turn around and go  
  
Woah, woah  
How my eyes adore you  
As you walk into the room  
  
Anytime that you're feeling restless  
Take a deep breath and let it go  
Only know that it leaves me breathless  
Anytime that you're feeling low  
  
Anytime that you're feeling lonely  
Come along and be mine only  
I can see your future with me  
Can you fill the need within me?  
  
When I close my eyes  
You're the only one I love  
Take me darling  
  
If he don't want to know  
Just turn around and go  
  
Woah, woah  
There's enough for everybody  
The world she don't mind  
  
Woah, woah  
How my eyes adore you  
As you walk into the room
