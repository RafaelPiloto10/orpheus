It's time to tell my story  
of a girl I used to know  
Always cried into her pillow  
under pinups on the wall  
She didn't make Italia Conte  
didn't get that TV show  
Then a nice man said he'd help her  
with a new portfolio  
  
Missus be Missus E Missus A-you-T  
Missus I Missus F-you-L  
I'm gonna reach the top  
I ain't ever gonna stop  
and I'm sure gonna ring your bell  
Missus D Missus I Missus F-F-I  
Missus see Missus you-L-T  
If ever there's a girl  
that could rock your world  
Then that girl sure is me  
(right!)  
  
(Chorus)  
So the fun won't start til she's living it up  
feeling good on top of the pops  
Can you make it me plus one?  
Dress falls down at the aftershow  
She breaks down in the video  
Think you'll find it's me plus one  
  
Now this wannabe seniorita  
met a group of likely girls  
Traded posters and the voxpops  
for jetting round the world  
But it didn't make her happy  
and now she flies alone  
The wrong pictures in the paper  
and no one back at home  
  
The people around you  
won't tell you how it is  
Don't you think it's gone on long enough?  
Take a look at yourself  
Get out of the car  
You know it's time  
you've got to let it go
