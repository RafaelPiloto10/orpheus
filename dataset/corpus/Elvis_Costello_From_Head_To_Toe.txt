Oh, well, now you're the girl I'm simply mad about.  
Oh yes, I'm really glad it's been me. Oh yeah.  
I hope that you've been getting ready,  
Cause I'm gonna ask you to go steady with me.  
I got two eyes that happened by ya,  
And when they saw you, they said they knew you were fine.  
I got two lips that long to kiss you,  
And when they speak, they say they wish you were mine.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
Oh, I got a little heart inside me beating  
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time.  
You better watch out 'cause of what I say  
Cause baby, don't you know that I ain't playing a game?  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground, sweet baby.  
  
I got two legs and I got two feet that always take me to your street  
Everyday, all the time.  
No matter which way I try to go, my legs and my feet  
They seem to know the way.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground. Hey, sweet baby.  
I am yours from head to toe. Sweet baby.
