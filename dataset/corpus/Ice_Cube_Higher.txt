Yo I want to get high  
I want to get high  
  
Walking through campus with my backpack  
Bailin' to orientation  
So I can change the nation  
See many faces but none of 'em mirror me  
  
Show my ID to the punk ass security  
Step on the quad lookin' for the track squad  
Walked by a bitch who think she's God  
Passing me a flyer talkin' 'bout the Messiah  
  
She want to take me higher  
Keep your rhetoric in the heavens  
Look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans  
Done spent 6 years in the college  
  
Always telling me to question the knowledge  
Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll  
And not even one cave bitch in our click  
Sayin' fuck Professor Fitz  
  
I come from the land of the Bloods and the Crips (What's up nigga)  
Don't like scholarships because they hurt me  
Nothin' but a slave to the university  
That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya  
Caught by a liar who want to take me higher  
  
[Chorus]  
Shit, he want to take me higher  
Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit  
I want to get high so high  
Chocolate Thai  
  
I want to take flight ya Goddamn right  
It's a party every fucking night  
Been there for about 6 weeks  
Walked by the freaks  
Look, black greeks  
How the fuck ya figure  
I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga  
White boy in the room with me  
Who never saw BET what the fuck  
He's about to erupt and turn red  
Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads  
'Cause he can't deal with the overkill  
College ain't nothin' but niggerville  
And he regret that his school is filled  
With niggers jews and wetbacks  
Plus chinks now he drinks  
Hour after hour screaming white power  
Motherfucker want me to call him sire  
He want to take me higher  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A girl gets date raped just like that  
At a frat now she chase the cat  
Feminist saying women is God's gift  
Do you need a lift can I take a sniff  
Do I sound sexist cause I'm chasin'  
After Deja she from Texas?  
Down to kick the asses of the fascists  
Who want to put me in the oven and burn me to ashes  
But I'm not burnin' the world keeps turnin'  
And nobody learnin'  
'Cause college is full of shit  
Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies  
Chillin' at a rally for peace  
The beast from white power up in the tower  
With the M-1 gun and a scope on dope  
Thinkin' he's the great white hope  
Motherfucker levels off  
He want to see me 6 feet deep shoveled off  
Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire  
Who want to take me higher  
  
[Chorus]  
Shit they want to take me higher  
Wait until they get a load of me  
Shit they want to take me higher  
They want to take me higher  
Unh damn they want to take me higher  
Damn wait until they get a load of me  
Damn unh they want to take me they want to take me  
Them muthafuckas'll never break me shit
