The night of reckoning  
The days of old  
His might is menacing  
Sword and shield made of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
Conquest and fire  
The age of desire  
When man will be free once more  
Like rays from the sun  
That heal everyone  
Living for evermore  
  
Bow down in reverence  
Keep faith be true  
Give thanks for armistice  
Be brave he'll come through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Conquest and fire  
We will be strong  
Days of desire  
Making us stronger  
  
Revenge and reckoning  
Beware of this god  
His might is menacing  
Shield made of gold  
  
Sword and shield of gold  
The mighty stand alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Conquest and fire  
We will be strong  
Days of desire  
Making us stronger  
  
Conquest attest  
Stands triumphant  
Heaven sent, be vigilant  
Don't relinquish
