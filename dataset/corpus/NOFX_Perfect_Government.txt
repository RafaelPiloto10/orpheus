Even if it's easy to be free  
What's your definition of freedom?  
And who the fuck are you, anyway?  
Who the fuck are they?  
Who the fuck am I to say?  
What the fuck is really going on?  
How did the cat get so fat?  
Why does the family die?  
Do you care why?  
'cause there hasn't been a sign  
Of anything gettin' better in the ghetto  
People's fed up  
But when they get up  
You point your fuckin' finger  
You racist, you bigot  
But that's not the problem  
Now is it?  
It's all about the money  
Political power is takin  
Protecting the rich denying the poor  
Yeah, they love to watch the war from the White House  
And I wonder how can they sleep at night?  
How can they sleep at night?  
How did the cat get so fat?  
How did the cat get so fat?  
How did the cat get so fat?  
How did the cat get so fat?
