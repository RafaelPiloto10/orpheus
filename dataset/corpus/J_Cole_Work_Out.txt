I wanna see you work for me, work out for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, we got a good thing  
Don't know if I'mma see you again  
But is that a good thing?  
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am  
I know what's on your brain  
You're probably hopin' never would end  
Like is it the real thing  
Or is it just a one night stand well then  
  
Let me see you get high and go low  
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
  
High and go low  
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
  
She like them bar with the big old chains  
Ride around town in the big old Range  
I knew her when I rocked big old chains  
Now the little nigga doing big old things  
Would you look at that, I came back for her  
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it  
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her  
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard  
I told her, baby girl come here  
Know I run the town even when I aint from there  
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party I made  
What your nigga make in one year, thats unfair but  
So is life, take a chance roll a dice  
Money can't buy you love cause it's over priced  
Don't over think just hope it's right  
I'm only here for the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me see you get high and go low  
Now girl would you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
High and go low  
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
  
Carolina blue kicks, fresh on the scene  
Hottest nigga on the block, damn girl you mean  
They be starting shit, but it's your world  
On my Martin shit, you go girl  
She bad and you know it, some niggas save Hoes  
I'm not that heroic  
Could you be my escort  
Cause just like them two door Fords  
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more  
Cole World, real Cole World  
Them boys cool, me I'm on fire  
Know whats on my mind, tryna see whats on yours tonight  
Tonight, tonight  
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast  
Up late so you probably skip class  
Life is a test so before the night pass get right  
Get right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Cole World)  
  
Straight up, now tell me do you really wanna love me forever  
Oh, oh, oh  
Or is it just a hit and run  
  
(Well, hey)  
  
Straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when we together  
Oh, oh, oh  
Come here girl, lets get it on  
  
(Work out for me, work out for me)  
  
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever?  
Oh, oh, oh  
Or is it just a hit and run  
  
Well, Straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when were together  
Oh, oh, oh  
Come here girl lets get it on  
  
(Work out for me, work out for me)
