Tired of injustice  
Tired of the schemes  
Your lies are disgusting  
What does it mean  
Kicking me down  
I gotta get up  
As jacked as it sounds  
The whole system sucks  
  
Peek in the shadow  
Come into the light  
You tell me I'm wrong  
then you better prove you're right  
You're sellin' out souls but  
I care about mine  
I've got to get stronger  
And I won't give up the fight  
  
With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream  
You're bash abusing victimize within the scheme  
  
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize  
  
Somebody please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it  
  
Stop pressurin' me  
Just stop pressurin' me  
Stop pressurin' me  
Make me wanna scream  
  
Tired of tellin' the story your way  
You're causin' confusion  
You think it's okay  
  
You keep changin' the rules  
While you keep plain' the game  
I can't take it much longer  
I think I might go insane  
  
with such confusion  
Don't it make you wanna scream  
Your bach abusin' victimize within the scheme  
  
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie  
  
Oh father, please have mercy  
'Cause I just can't take it  
  
Stop pressurin' me  
Just stop pressurin' me  
Stop pressurin' me  
Make me wanna scream  
  
Break down:  
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw on the TV this evening  
I was disgusted by all the injustice  
All the injustice  
  
With such delusions don't it make you wanna scream  
You're bash abusin' victimize within the scheme  
  
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize  
  
Oh brother please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it  
  
Stop pressurin' me  
Just stop pressurin' me  
Stop pressurin' me  
Make me wanna scream
