Woke up late again this morning  
Cause I was late again last night  
In the mood that I was born in  
And my skin was feelin' tight  
I took a short cut to the city  
Had myself a drink or two  
I got over feeling shaky  
But I'm still not over you  
  
Chorus:  
God, I might as well forget you  
You ain't never comin' true  
Seems like ever since I met you  
I've been gettin' over you  
  
I don't crave no conversation  
I don't need no sympathy  
All I want is my old lady  
That old lady wantin' me  
So take me any way you want me  
I'll take you any way I can  
I don't want your sack of candy  
Just some sweetness now and then  
  
Chorus:  
I got to get myself together  
With someone who wants some too  
Maybe I can learn to love her  
While I'm a-gettin' over you
