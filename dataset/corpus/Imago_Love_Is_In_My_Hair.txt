I've known you for quite awhile.  
Never ashamed to tell you what's on my mind,  
Whether it's wrong or right.  
When I feel like salting the ocean  
You're fresh water for my eyes.  
  
You give me this  
You give me that  
And this kiss is getting wild  
And just maybe, just maybe.  
  
When I get to my room  
I'm still drowning from your stare  
How could I now sleep  
When love is in my hair?  
  
Set aside some time to be with you tomorrow  
Set aside some time to repeat what happened tonight.  
  
Whenever I carry jars of regret  
I stumble over and over again  
The slip breaks me  
And that kills your heart  
When you feel like falling apart  
I'd come running to catch you.  
  
You give me this  
You give me that  
And this kiss is getting wild  
And just maybe, just maybe.  
  
When I get to my room  
I'm still drowning from your stare  
How could I now sleep  
When love is in my hair?  
  
Set aside some time to be with you tomorrow  
Set aside some time to repeat what happened tonight.  
  
Oh you give me so much hope  
All the stars have agreed  
Let my dreams somersault  
Paint your rainbows here.
