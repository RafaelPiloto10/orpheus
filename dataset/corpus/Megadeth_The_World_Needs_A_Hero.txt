An Iron fist quietly sits inside the Velvet Glove  
Take control, untouchable just like God above  
I can't escape, wrapped in red tape, what will become of me?  
If I object, then I defect my country 'tis of thee  
  
The White House is calling  
Tell them I'll call them back  
Just tell them anything  
Yeah get them off my back  
  
The world needs a hero  
  
Not that I would ever lie but I have no choice  
Words I say heard today are not mine, just my voice  
  
NATO is on line 1  
They want to talk to me  
Tell them that I'm not in  
Tell them that I'm not free  
  
The world needs a hero  
  
Phantom rule, the hidden jewel who's really in control?  
On puppet strings, a nation swings undermined by moles  
  
The UN is on hold  
Tell them I'll call them back  
Yeah tell them anything  
Just get them off my back  
  
The world needs a hero  
  
Dave the White House is calling  
They want to talk to me  
Tell them that I can't be bought  
Tell them that I'm not free  
  
The world needs a hero
