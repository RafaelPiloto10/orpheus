I will I will live for a year or two  
Maybe just for a year  
I will die yes I will die  
I rest secure in that  
  
I am awful sure that this thing ain't no accident  
And I just can't believe that AIDS is just some act of God  
I will reach for you I will reach my hand  
  
No one will reach for me no one will touch my skin  
Yes I will accept I will accept my pain  
I don't deserve to die like this no one deserves to die like this  
  
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world  
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world  
Break the world  
  
I will not be denied, I will not be ignored  
I am not invisible anymore  
  
I will not be denied, I will not be ignored, I am real  
I won't go away, I am not invisible anymore  
  
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world  
I get so mad I just want to break the world  
Break the world, break the world
