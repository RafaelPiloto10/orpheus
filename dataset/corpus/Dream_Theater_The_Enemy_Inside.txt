Over and over again  
I relive the moment  
I'm bearing the burden within  
Open wounds hidden under my skin  
  
Pain is real as a cut that bleeds  
The face I see every time I try to sleep  
Staring at me crying  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I can't escape from the enemy inside  
  
I sever myself from the world  
And shut down completely  
All alone in my own living hell  
Overcome with irrational fear  
  
Under the weight of the world on my chest  
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath  
Tell me I'm not dying  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I can't escape from the enemy inside  
  
I'm a burden and a travesty  
I'm a prisoner of regret  
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams  
I am hanging on the edge  
  
Disaster lurks around the bend  
Paradise came to an end  
And no magic pill  
Can bring it back again  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I can't escape from the enemy inside
