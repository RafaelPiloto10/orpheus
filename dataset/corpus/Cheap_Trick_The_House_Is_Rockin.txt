Words and music by tom petersson and rick nielsen  
  
I know, you know something's wrong,  
Still, I gotta go home.  
He knows, she knows,  
Shut all the doors and lock all the windows.  
Heavy, heavy, heavy troubles,  
The house is rockin', still, I gotta go in.  
Can't find the words 'cause they're so damned tough, actin' like fools that
can't get enough.  
Troubles yeah, I can't explain what I can't see.  
Oh boy, oh boy, the house is rockin', the house is rockin'.  
Oh, boy, oh boy, non-stop, day and night, ev'ry day, ev'ry night.  
Oh boy, oh boy, the house is rockin', the house is rockin'.  
Oh boy, can't stop the fightin', no.  
  
He said, she said something's wrong,  
Still, they're livin' at home.  
We heard, we heard, sounded like the end of the world.  
Heavy, heavy, heavy troubles, the house is rockin',  
Still, I gotta go in.  
Can't find the words 'cause they're so damned tough, actin' like fools that
can't get enough.  
Troubles yeah, I can't explain what I can't see.  
  
Oh boy, oh boy, the house is rockin', the house is rockin'.  
Oh, boy, oh boy, non-stop, day and night, ev'ry day, ev'ry night.  
Oh boy, oh boy, the house is rockin', the house is rockin'.  
Oh boy, oh boy can't stop the fightin', no.  
  
I know, you know my world is in a spin,  
You wanna come on in?  
He said, she said it's bad for the children,  
He went and bought a gun.  
Heavy, heavy, heavy, problems, yeah.  
  
The house is rockin', still, I gotta go in.  
Oh boy, oh boy, the house is rockin', the house is rockin'.  
Oh, boy, oh boy, non-stop, day and night, ev'ry day, ev'ry night.  
Oh boy, oh boy, the house is rockin', the house is rockin'.  
Oh boy, oh boy can't stop the fightin', no.  
Oh boy, oh boy.  
Oh boy, oh boy.
