Everytime the bluebird sings  
My heart takes wings to the sky  
The bluebird greyside fly  
To my place in your eyes  
Cause after all, I did all I could  
And you did your best, just the same  
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame  
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending  
We'll be like bluebird do, the beautiful lie  
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie  
Everytime the bluebird sings  
My heart takes wings to the sky  
The bluebird greyside fly  
To my place in your eyes  
Cause after all, I did all I could  
And you did your best, just the same  
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame  
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending  
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie  
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
