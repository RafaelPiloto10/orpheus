I am here to testify  
That you're the only one I belong to  
I don't know where to start  
It turned into an art  
Not to show the world that it was you  
Who made me realize not to compromise  
The fact that you and I should need  
Know we're gonna get, gonna get get  
  
[Chorus]  
Bombastic Love  
So fantastic  
Where I'm completley yours and you are mine  
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie  
When we fall in love for the first time  
  
Don't know why I feel so insecure  
I never understood what it stood for  
I gotta make sure that blidness won't stop me again  
I can't sit and wait anymore  
You made me realize not to compromise  
The fact that you and I should need  
I know were gonna get  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be bombastic love  
Everything is gonna be alright  
When I'm yours and you are mine  
It's gonna be fantastic love  
When I wake up everything is still the same  
And you don't even know my name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know we're gonna get  
  
[Chorus]
