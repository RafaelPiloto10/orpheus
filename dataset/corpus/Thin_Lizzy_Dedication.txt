This is dedicated to the woman I love  
Wherever she stands - my dedication  
This is dedicated to the millions  
That are starving from hunger - in dedication  
  
Dedication  
Dedication  
I dedicate it, dedicate it  
Dedication  
  
This is dedicated to the front lines that are dying  
For dedication  
This is dedicated to child of mine wherever she stands  
I give a dedication  
  
Dedication  
Dedication  
I dedicate it, dedicate it  
Dedication  
  
This is dedicated for the children  
That are starving (? )  
I dedicate this to the millions  
I dedicate it to you  
  
Oh yeah  
A dedication  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Dedicated  
  
This is dedicated to the woman I love  
(I dedicate this song, to the woman I love)  
Wherever she stands, I give her dedication  
(wherever she stands)  
This is dedicated, to the millions, that are starving - in dedication  
(there are millions, they are starving from hunger, oh)  
  
Dedication (I dedicate it)  
Dedication (this song is for you)  
I dedicate it (dedicate it), dedicate it (dedicate it)  
Dedication (dedication)  
  
Dedication (to the woman I love)  
Dedication (to the child I knew)  
I dedicate it (dedicate it), dedicate it (dedicate it)  
Dedication (dedication)  
  
Dedication (I dedicate it)
