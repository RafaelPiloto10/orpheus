Well, once they had a dance they called the bunny-hop  
Now the cats are in a trance, all they wanna do is bop  
So bop, honey bop, well bop, a-honey bop  
Oh bop, honey bop, well don't stop, a-honey bop  
When the band begins to rock and it's rockin' to your blues  
If you think you blow your top  
Well, put on your rockin' shoes  
And bop, honey bop, well bop, a-honey bop  
Let's bop, honey bop, don't stop, a-honey bop  
  
When the night is up and gone, but you still wanna go  
Though you see light of dawn, baby tell the band to blow  
And bop, honey bop, well bop, a-honey bop  
Well bop, honey bop, don't stop, a-honey bop  
Well the waltz is for the square and the rhumba is too old  
Baby, we're just rockin' let it satisfy your soul  
So bop, honey bop, well bop, a-honey bop  
Oh bop, honey bop, well don't stop, a-honey bop  
  
Well, now you've heard the dance, they call the bunny-hop  
But the cats are in a trance, all they wanna do is bop  
So bop, honey bop, well bop, a-honey bop  
Well bop, honey bop, well don't stop, a-bop-bop-bop
