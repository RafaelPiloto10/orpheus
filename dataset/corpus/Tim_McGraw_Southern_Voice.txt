Hank Williams sang it  
Number three drove it  
Chuck Berry twanged it  
Will Farmer wrote it  
Aretha Franklin sold it  
Dolly Parton graced it  
Rosa Parks rode it  
Scarlett O chased it  
  
Smooth as the hickory wind  
That blows from Memphis  
Down the Apalachicola  
It's "Hi y'all, did ya eat?  
Well, come on in  
I'm sure glad to know ya."  
Don't let this old gold cross  
And this Allman Brothers t-shirt throw ya  
It's cicadas making noise  
With the southern voice  
  
Hank Aaron smacked it  
Michael Jordan dunked it  
Pocahontas tracked it  
Jack Daniels drunk it  
Tom Petty rocked it  
Dr. King paved it  
Bear Bryant won it  
Billy Graham saved it  
  
Smooth as the hickory wind  
That blows from Memphis  
Down the Apalachicola  
It's "Hi y'all, did ya eat?  
Well, come on in  
I'm sure glad to know ya."  
Don't let this old gold cross  
And this Crimson Tide t-shirt throw ya.  
It's cicadas making noise  
With the southern voice  
  
Jesus is my friend  
America is my home  
Sweet iced tea and Jerry Lee  
Daytona Beach  
That's what gets to me  
I can feel it in my bones  
  
Smooth as the hickory wind  
That blows from Memphis  
Down the Apalachicola  
It's "Hi y'all, did ya eat?  
Well, come on in child  
I'm sure glad to know ya."  
Don't let this old gold cross  
And this Charlie Daniels t-shirt throw ya.  
We're just boys making noise  
With the southern voice  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Southern voice  
I got a southern voice  
A southern voice
