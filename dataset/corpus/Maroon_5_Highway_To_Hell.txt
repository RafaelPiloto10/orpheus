Living easy, livin' free  
Season ticket, on a one - way ride  
Asking nothing, leave me be  
Taking everything in my stride  
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme  
Ain't nothing I would rather do  
Going down, party time  
My friends are gonna be there too  
  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
  
No stop signs, speedin' limit  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Like a wheel, gonna spin it  
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round  
Hey Satan! Paid my dues  
Playin' in a rockin' band  
Hey Mama! Look at me  
I'm on my way to the promise land  
  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
  
Don't stop me!  
  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
  
And I'm goin down... all the way!  
I'm on the highway to hell...
