Well I'm drifting and drifting,  
Like a ship out on the sea.  
Well I'm drifting and drifting,  
Like a ship out on the sea.  
Well I ain't got nobody  
In this world to care for me.  
  
If my baby would only take me back again  
If my baby would only take me back again.  
Well you know I ain't good for nothin' baby  
  
Well I haven't got no friends.  
  
I give you all of my money,  
Tell me what more can I do.  
I give you all my money,  
Tell me what more can I do.  
Well you just a good little girl  
But you just won't be true.  
  
Bye-bye baby, baby bye-bye bye-bye,  
It's gonna be too late baby  
I'll be so far away.
