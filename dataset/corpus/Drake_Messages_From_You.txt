I forgot about you last night  
For the first time in a long time I Didddd  
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on makin  
In amazin conversation with this girl named lorraine  
Who says she's from L. A.  
Who keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay  
Ooohhhh  
She could be good for me (yeahhh)  
This what you text me  
Tell me that you miss me  
I forget about Lorraine  
And in fact she's right here with me  
And she's starin at my face  
Something that could change  
Thought that all these feelings went away (yeahh)  
  
I hate gettin messages from youuuu (fromm youuu)  
It's like you know the perfect shit to say  
Thought that all these feelings went away
