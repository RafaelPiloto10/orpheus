Look at me, the answer is so clear  
Lying close by the fire place  
I wish that you could see yourself this way  
My love, with the firelight upon your face.  
  
Ain't it strange how love put things together?  
One like you, someone like me.  
But no one ever moved me like the way you do  
And held against you, love I am weak, oh yeah  
  
Before us now, the dream of love is playin'  
A butterfly risin' from the flame  
You and me don't need no chain  
Since this feeling came to us  
A touch of love, a lighter touch  
  
This touch of love, this lighter touch,  
Than hands of love through time  
Reaching up to have and to hold you  
But you know I'll always stay If I  
Am free to go. You know I'll take  
Your love into my soul. Be lighter  
Touch of love this lighter, lighter  
Lighter touch
