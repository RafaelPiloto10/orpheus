Stay  
Just a little bit longer  
Please please please please please  
Tell me that you're going to  
  
Daddy don't mind, do you  
Mama don't mind, no  
If we have another dance  
Just one more time.

Just a little bit longer,  
Please let me hear  
You say that you will  
Say you will  
  
Won't you place your sweet lips  
To mine  
Won't you say you love me  
All of the time

Just a little bit longer  
Please please please please please  
Tell me that you're going to  
Oh, come on stay, come on come on come on, stay  
Come on come on come on, stay  
Come on come on come on, stay
