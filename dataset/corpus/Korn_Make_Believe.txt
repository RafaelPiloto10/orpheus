I'm thinking of,  
Thanking all the fucked people  
Thanking all the shit I love,  
They are all the things I've made  
  
Straight from my heart,  
Begging all the same people  
Burning is the same evil  
Some how making me feel sane  
  
Waiting all this time  
I've got nothing to hold on  
But the faces of my life  
I can see before I'm gone  
  
Sometimes I feel it chasing me  
All the hate that's breaking free  
I realize I'm taking everything  
And the shit seems to follow  
  
This time I feel it taking me  
To a place I hate to be  
All along I sing to make believe  
And the shit seems to follow  
  
I'm thinking of,  
Making all the fucked people  
Making the bitches I love  
Make them die and go away  
  
Pain from the start  
All my dreams are ripped apart  
Thanking all the fucked people  
They are all the things I've saved  
  
Waiting all this time  
I've got nothing to hold on  
But the faces of my life  
I can see before I'm gone  
  
Sometimes I feel it chasing me  
All the hate that's breaking free  
I realize I'm taking everything  
And the shit seems to follow  
  
This time I feel it taking me  
To a place I hate to be  
All along I sing to make believe  
And the shit seems to follow  
  
Your Life (your life),  
I hate (I hate) it, oh god  
Can I replay (replay)?  
Stop and help me. (stop and help me)  
  
Sometimes I feel it chasing me  
All the hate that's breaking free  
I realize I'm taking everything  
And the shit seems to follow  
  
This time I feel it taking me  
To a place I hate to be  
All along I sing to make believe  
And the shit seems to follow  
  
The shit seems to follow (Shit seems to follow)  
The shit seems to follow  
The shit seems to follow
