Oh, I'm gonna tell you a story 'bout a little boy.  
Oh, a sad little boy.  
I'm talkin' 'bout little johnny hooker.  
  
Little johnny hooker was a sissy on the street all his life --  
All his natural born life.  
Until his daddy took him aside and said,  
"son, now here's your switchblade knife boy."  
  
He said "get out in the street boy,  
Cut yourself some meat boy.  
Get out on your own side of the road,  
And lighten my load."  
  
Johnny made a mistake and took his knife down to school one day.  
Hey, yeah, yeah.  
And, when the bell rang for lunch.  
Freddie miller went and got in johnny's way boy.  
He took his knife from his pocket, pushed a button on the side.  
When he seen the queen steel,  
You ought to seen the light in freddy's eyes.  
  
Oh, yeah ...  
  
Little johnny hooker learned his lesson from the knife now you see,  
(yes he did.)  
Because for what he done to fred he spent some time in a penitentiary.  
It was a day in the courtroom, exhibit letter "a."  
When the jury seen the knife they put little johnny's ass away.  
  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.
