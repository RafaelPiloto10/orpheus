Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time  
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time - so don't let go  
Oh well night after night I'm a little confused  
I can't seem to get it right still I might  
With a little assistance and a piece of your love  
Get closer to your heart  
Well at least it would be a start - so don't let go  
Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time  
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time - so don't let go  
Well I'll try - I mean I will attempt to negotiate  
This little incline -  
Whoops there's a hill and another spectacular chance  
For me to be -  
Once again with you and I know I'll make it through  
So don't let go  
Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time  
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time - so don't let go
