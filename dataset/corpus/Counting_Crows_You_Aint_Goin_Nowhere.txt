Clouds so swift  
Rain won't lift  
Gate won't close  
Railings froze  
Get your mind off wintertime  
You ain't going nowhere  
Oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
Oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
I don't care  
How many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
Pick up your money  
And pack up your tent  
You ain't going nowhere  
Oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Buy me a flute  
And a gun that shoots  
Tailgates and substitutes  
Strap yourself  
To a tree with roots  
'Cause you know you ain't going nowhere  
I said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Genghis Khan  
He could not keep  
All his kings  
Supplied with sleep  
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep  
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it  
And Everybody says  
Whoo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
Oh, no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
I said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Well everybody said oo-ee! Ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair!  
  
Oo-ee! Won't you ride me high  
Tomorrow's the day  
My bride's gonna come  
I said oh no, are we gonna fly  
Down into the easy chair!
