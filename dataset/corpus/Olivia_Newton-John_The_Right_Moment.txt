Spinning on another wheel  
Going round in slow motion  
Caught up in another dream  
Drifting on a blue ocean  
When you gonna reach out  
Only you can turn your world around  
When will you surrender  
And wake up to the real  
But you don't want to start just yet  
You watch the seasons come and go  
You remember and then you forget  
All along the way  
You can make a better life  
You're just waiting for the right moment  
You can find another way  
You're just waiting for the right moment  
When you gonna let go  
And forget about the life you knew  
When will you surrender  
And wake up to the real  
Now you know that it's all borrowed time  
Still you waste another day  
But you watch and you wait for a sign  
All along the way
