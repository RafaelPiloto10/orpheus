I want to take you baby  
I want to take you out  
I want to wine and dine you  
Oh I want to twist and twist and shout  
I want you hot in my arms  
So soft on my bed  
You get the key to my heart  
Oh when you wear that sweet dress  
  
But you're too physical physical to me  
You're just too physical physical no to me  
  
I want your rough house baby  
I want this right in your ear  
You let me feel your danger  
I let you make this feeling clear here  
I want the touch of your charms  
The heat of your breath  
I want to say all those things  
That would be better unsaid  
No  
  
But you're too physical physical to me  
You're just too physical oh  
You're too physical for me  
You're too physical to me  
You're really jus- just too- just  
Too really fuck no  
  
You're just too physical [x2]  
Too fucking physical  
No [x7]  
Oh you're too physical  
Just too physical  
Just too
