Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
Your girlfriend said so but I don't really know  
That don't mean we fucked around that night last week when you left town  
  
I was tweakin' by myself one night that's when I wrote this tune  
Didn't have no need for that bed in my hotel room  
Sometimes right now since I've left the pen  
I feel like I'm right back there again  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from  
  
Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
My girlfriend said so, she's a little ho  
That don't mean I fuck around, I like to keep that higher ground  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from  
Don't tease me, don't tease me, don't tease  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from
