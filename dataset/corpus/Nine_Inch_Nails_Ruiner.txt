You had all of them on your side didn't you?  
You believe in all your lies didn't you?  
The ruiner's got a lot to prove he's got nothing to lose and now he  
Made you believe  
The ruiner's your only friend well he's the living end to the cattle  
He deceives  
The raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he  
Sees  
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease  
How did you get so big?  
How did you get so strong?  
How did you get so hard?  
How did you get so long?  
You had to give them all a sign, didn't you?  
You had to covet what was mine, didn't you?  
The ruiner's a collector he's an infector serving his shit to his flies  
Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will  
Suddenly realize  
Maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go  
And maybe that fucked me up so much more than you'll ever know  
How did you get so big?  
How did you get so strong?  
How did you get so hard?  
How did you get so long?  
What you gave to me  
My perfect ring of scars  
You know I can see what you really are  
You didn't hurt me nothing can hurt me  
You didn't hurt me nothing can stop me now
