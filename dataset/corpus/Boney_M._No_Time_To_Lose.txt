No time to lose  
My man is coming in today  
No time to lose  
I know he must be on his way  
No time to lose  
I want to look just right for him  
No time to lose  
Tonight will be the night for him  
My man is big and strong  
And not the shyest one  
When he gets hold of me  
We're having lots of fun  
There's no denying  
He sends me flying  
He does so much for me  
Yessirre  
Yessirre  
Got the touch for me  
No time to lose  
My man is clear and free again  
No time to lose  
And so it's him and me again  
No time to lose  
I'm gonna do the dressing up  
No time to lose  
So he can do the messin' up  
He won't be knocking  
He'll come on rocking  
Though he'll be reall' wild  
He such a honey child  
There's no denyin'  
He sends me flyin'  
He does so much for me  
Yessirre  
Yessirre  
Got the touch for me  
No time to lose  
I got myself a winner now  
No time to lose  
No longer he's a sinner now  
No time to lose  
There'll be some heavy lovin' soon  
No time to lose  
It's almost like an honeymoon  
No time to lose...
