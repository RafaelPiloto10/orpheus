What would you sacrifice for reality?  
Is it important what we used to be?  
  
Looks like I got here first  
Offer a king and I'll invite you in  
Spend carnival money  
Because tomorrow won't be as sunny  
  
Praise you  
I can't change you  
When I try to  
  
Above it all  
We end up somewhere  
If we're equal  
We could go far  
Dim the lights  
We're everything  
The day we try to bend it  
(We fall) like any other star  
  
Would you save this moment for another day?  
If you're told maybe and that's all the say  
  
Cross the waters to the silent  
Focus on love  
A golden dove  
Wake up (to) a new day  
Lets climb to the top
