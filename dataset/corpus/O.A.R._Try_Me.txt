It's been such a long day  
Followed by long nights  
Sit here by my myself  
But it just don't feel alright  
You been talking to me  
Everyone talking at me like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Try me  
I'll let you live  
I'll let you breathe  
Try me  
I'll pick you up  
And make you believe  
  
You're surrounded and scared, ain't ya?  
Nobody's there for you  
Under it all  
They don't shine away, you do  
But you're tangled up in  
Everything wrong for you  
Come on back to me  
And I will make it be the one  
Everyone talking at ya  
Everyone coming at ya like  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
I know it's been such a long time  
And I still don't let you in  
I know it feels like a long time  
But you're never coming back again  
Are you ever coming back again?  
  
It's been such a long day  
Followed the long nights  
Sit here by myself  
And it just don't feel alright  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Try me (I'll make you believe)  
Try me  
Come on try me (I'll make you believe)  
Try me [Repeat: x 2]  
I'll let you live  
I'll let you breathe  
(Try me, yeah)  
I'll pick you up  
And make you believe
