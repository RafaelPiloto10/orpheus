Mm  
Stupid in love  
Oh  
Stupid in love  
Hm  
  
Let me tell you something  
Never have I ever been a size ten in my whole life  
I left the engine running  
I just came to see  
What you would do if I gave you a chance to make things right  
So made it, even though Katie told me that this will be nothing but  
A waste of time  
And she was right  
Um,  
Don't understand it but it's blood on your hands  
Is still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies  
And I just don't know why  
Oh  
  
This is stupid  
I'm not stupid  
Don't talk to me  
Like I'm stupid  
I still love you but  
I just can't do this  
I maybe dumb but  
I'm not stupid  
  
My new nickname is you idiot (such an idiot) um  
That's what my friends are calling me  
When they see me I lean'n to my phone  
They're telling me let go  
He is not the one  
I thought I saw your potential  
I guess that's what made me dumb  
  
He don't want it.  
Not like you want it  
Scheming and cheating  
Oh girl why do you waste your time  
You know he ain't right  
They're telling me this  
I don't wanna listen but you insist  
On repeatedly trying to tell me lies  
And I just don't know why  
  
This is stupid  
I'm not stupid  
Don't talk to me  
Like I'm stupid  
I still love you but  
I just can't do this  
I maybe dumb but  
I'm not stupid  
  
Trying to make this work  
But you act like a jerk  
Silly of me to keep holding on  
Oh  
But the dunst cap is off  
You don't know what you've lost  
And you won't realize till  
I'm gone, gone, gone  
That I was the one  
Which one of us is really dumb  
  
Oh  
No  
No, I'm not stupid in love  
  
This is stupid (no no no)  
I'm not stupid (no no no)  
Don't talk to me  
Like I'm stupid (like I'm stupid)  
I still love you but  
I just can't do this (I just can't do this but)  
I maybe dumb but  
I'm not stupid  
  
I'm maybe dumb but I'm not stupid in love
