Don't need a crystal ball for me to see clearly  
No astrology or Tarot cards  
Watching CNN and holding my breath  
To face the daily news scares me to death  
  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so fatalistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I don't believe a thing  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so nihlistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
For what tomorrow brings  
  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like being sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
  
Everybody's mind is badly infected  
Everybody feeds the parasite  
Everything is dark so why not accept it?  
Everything is far more black than white  
  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so fatalistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I don't believe a thing  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so pissed-off-istic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
Of what tomorrow brings  
  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like feeling sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so fatalistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I don't believe a thing  
I'm pessi-mystic  
I'm so nihlistic  
I'm pessi-mystic  
Of what tomorrow brings  
  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like being sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I can't hear a word you say  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
I like feeing sick this way  
So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
