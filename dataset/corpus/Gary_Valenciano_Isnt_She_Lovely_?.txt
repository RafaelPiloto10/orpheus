[ recorded by mr. Pure energy Gary V for kris aquino's album ]  
  
Isn't she lovely, isn't she wonderful?  
Isn't she precious, less than one minute old,  
I never thought through love you'll be  
Making love as lovely as she.  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.  
Isn't she pretty she's so pretty, truly the angel best,  
For I am so happy I'm so happy, we have been heaven blest,  
I can't believe what God has done,  
To you, He has given life to one,  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.  
Isn't she lovely she's so lovely, life and love are the same.  
Life is Aida Aida, the meaning of her name.  
Candies good have not been done.  
Without you she'll be the one.  
Oh so very lovely, isn't she pretty? Isn't she pretty?  
Isn't she lovely, yes, she is made from love.
