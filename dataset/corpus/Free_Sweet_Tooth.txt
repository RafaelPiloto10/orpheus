Paul rodgers  
  
It's like a soft caressing sea  
Or making love in harmony  
Or the centre of a starry galaxy  
It's like the richness that's inside  
The one I'm trying to describe  
Or the living water stretching far and wide  
Searching for a shadow in the morning sun  
Playing with your woman when there's work to be done  
People, won't you listen when I tell the truth  
I give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth yeah yeah  
It's like a sound that rests my soul  
Or like a part that's now a whole  
Or as something that is burning bright as gold  
I want her near me everyday  
Then I want to hear her say  
There is somthing here between us as we lay  
Searching for a shadow in the morning sun  
Playing with your woman when there's work to be done  
People, won't you listen when I tell the truth  
I give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth yeah yeah
