Oh, let's get 'em, boys  
Too many women, I've got too little time  
I keep on tryin'  
Man, if it kills me I know that I'll go  
Dead, stiff, and smilin'  
Oh, don't need no doctor puttin' me to bed  
Give me the nurse and I'll make sure that she's fed  
Don't need no doctor giving me pills  
I'm hot enough to give you chills  
Livin' life for love, I'm alive, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (I can't get enough)  
Get it right (right) I'm alive  
  
Take a look in the Book of Love, man it's understood  
Right to the letter  
One pretty girl makes you feel pretty good  
Two's even better  
Oh, I learned my lesson, my golden rule  
You know I made the teachers stay after school  
Don't look for reasons, don't waste my time  
I've got the goods to make you mine  
  
Livin' life for love, I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (I can't get enough)  
Get it right (right) I'm alive  
You know baby, you make my heart beat, alright  
  
Don't need no doctor  
Take a look at the Book of Love, man it's understood  
It ain't a crime to feel this good, no  
  
Livin' life for love, I'm alive, yeah, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (can't get enough)  
Get it right (right) I'm alive  
Sing it  
Livin' life, livin' life for love, I'm alive, I'm alive  
I can't get enough (can't get enough)  
Get it right I'm alive (I'm alive)  
Livin' life for love (livin' life for love)  
Livin' life for love (I'm alive)  
Livin' life for love, (yeah, can't get enough)  
Livin' life for love (I'm alive, whoo)  
Livin' life for love
