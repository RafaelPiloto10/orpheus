Love is a burning inside  
I never had this feeling before, no  
All I know is that it won't let me be myself  
Hey, is this really love  
Oh maybe that's the reason  
I feel so good when you're around  
(Feel so good when you're around)  
Why can't I remember  
The day I melted before your charms  
Oh was it way back in September  
When you held me in your arms  
Now that I see that you're the one for me  
It's no more a mystery  
Love has fallen down on me  
Ooh I'm in love with you  
Love has fallen on me  
Now I really see  
Love has fallen on me  
Oh what tender love you bring  
No, it's not a game  
Oh what tender love you bring  
No, it's not a game  
Hey what tender love you bring  
I fell in love with you  
Fell in love with you  
One day in September love came falling down on me  
One day in September love came tumbling down on me  
Ooh what tender love you bring  
Oh now Lord I can't, no no,  
And I can't believe my eyes  
No no one day in September,  
It came on down  
Oh fallin' down, love came falling all around  
I fell in love with you  
Fell in love with you
