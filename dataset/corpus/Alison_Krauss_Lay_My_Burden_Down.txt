Gonna lay my burden down  
Lay my body in the ground  
Cold clay against my skin  
But I don't care at all  
  
Can't seem to find my piece of mind  
So with the earth I'll lay entwined  
Six feet underground  
My feet are warm and dry  
  
When I get to the other side  
I'll put your picture way up high  
But I'm not coming back to you  
It's just too far  
  
If I was cast off on the sea  
Would you come and look for me  
Or would you just let me sink  
Beneath the waves so blue  
  
What if I had learned to fly  
Fly all night till day drew nigh  
Touch down upon a branch and  
Scan the crowd for you  
  
When I touch my feet on the land  
I'll kiss your lips and take you in  
But you know I'm not here to stay  
It's just too far  
  
Darling can't you hear me cry  
My bones are broke  
My tongue is tied  
The moon is swaying back and forth  
Against the navy sky  
Is all I can see  
My body is trembling on my knees  
Just have a little mercy on me  
Run away and hide  
  
When I sleep the angels sing  
But I cannot hear a thing  
Eyes close  
Dreaming of the better days gone by  
  
When I wake the trumpets play  
And I'm standing at the gates  
Fall down and joy  
I know my race has just been won  
  
When I was young my momma would say  
Well life is hard, but that's O.K.  
If you can make it through the day  
It's not that far  
No, it's not that far
