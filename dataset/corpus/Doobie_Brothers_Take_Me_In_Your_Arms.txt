I know you're leavin' me behind  
I'm seein' you darlin' for the very last time  
Show a little tenderness before you go  
Please let me feel your embrace once more  
  
Take me in your arms and rock me, rock me a little while  
We all must feel heartache sometimes  
Right now, right now i'm feelin' mine  
I've tried my best to be strong, but i'm not able  
I'm like a helpless child left in a cradle  
Before you leave me behind let me feel happy one more time  
  
Take me in your arms and rock me, rock me a little while  
I'm losin' you and my happiness  
My life is so dark i must confess  
I'll never, never see your smiling face no more  
I'll never, never hear your knock upon my door  
Before you leave me, leave me behind  
Let me feel happy one more time  
  
Take me in your arms and rock me, rock me a little while
