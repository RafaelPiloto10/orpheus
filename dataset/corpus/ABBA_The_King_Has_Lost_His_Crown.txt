I believe your new girl turned you down  
And they say she's pushin' you around  
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride  
Tell me my friend how many nights you've cried  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Was it hard to step down from your throne  
And to know tonight you're all alone  
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl  
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The word is all around  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown
