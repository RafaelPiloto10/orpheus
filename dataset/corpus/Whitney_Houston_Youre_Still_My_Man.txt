On the day that you left me  
You said you had no regrets  
There's a bond between us  
That hasn't been broken yet  
And the feelings between us  
Will never disappear  
How can you be far away  
When your spirit's here  
  
[Chorus]  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
We still belong together  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Our love will last forever  
  
And the seasons of our love  
Will always change I know  
Maybe that's the reason  
You felt we had to go  
But soon you'll be missing me  
Darling I know you well  
There's a magic we share together  
And no one can break that spell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll wait for you  
The thought that keeps me going each day  
Is I believe you still love me  
I love you more than words can say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're still my man  
Nothing's gonna change it  
Don't you know, you oughta know we belong together  
You're still my man  
And nothing can change it  
Oh baby oh darling you're in my heart forever  
'cause you're my man  
Without you  
Darling, our love at all  
  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Don't you know you oughta know we belong together  
Oh You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Oh baby oh darling you're in my heart forever  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
I'm yours, you know you're mine  
You're in my heart forever  
  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Don't you know you ought to know we belong together  
You're still my man
