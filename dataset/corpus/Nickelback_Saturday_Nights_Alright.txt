It's getting late I haven't seen my date  
So tell me when the boys get here  
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock  
Want to get a belly full of beer  
  
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of Winos  
And my old lady she don't care  
My sister's looking cute in her braces and boots  
A handful of grease in her hair  
  
Don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this town alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright alright alright  
  
They're packed pretty tight in here tonight  
I'm looking for a woman to treat me right  
I could use a little muscle to get what I need  
I'll drink a fifth of jack and scream out "She's with me!"  
  
A couple of the sound that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
I'm a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass
