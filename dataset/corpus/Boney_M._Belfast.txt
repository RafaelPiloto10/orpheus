Belfast  
Belfast  
Belfast  
Got to have a believin'  
Got to have a believin'  
Got to have a believin'  
All the people  
Cause the people are leavin'  
When the people believin'  
When the people believin'  
When the people believin'  
All the children cause the children  
Are leavin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Belfast  
Belfast  
When the country rings the leaving bell you're lost  
Belfast  
Belfast  
  
When the hate you have  
For one another's past  
You can try (You can try)  
You can try (You can try)  
You can try  
To tell the world the reason why  
Belfast  
Belfast  
Belfast  
It's the country that's changin'  
It's the country that's changin'  
It's the country that's changin'  
All the people  
Cause the people are leavin'  
It's the world that's deceivin'  
It's the world that's deceivin'  
It's the world that's deceivin'  
All the people  
Cause the people believin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the children believin'  
When the children believin'  
When the children believin'  
All the people  
Cause the people are leavin'  
When the people are leavin' (you)  
When the people are leavin'  
When the people are leavin'  
All the children  
Cause the children believin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Belfast  
Belfast  
Belfast
