City side walks, busy side walks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing  
People passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And in every corner you'll hear  
  
Silver Bells  
Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring a ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights  
Even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch  
See the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big seen  
And above all the bustle you'll hear  
  
Silver Bells  
Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring a ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Christmas day  
Silver bells  
Silver bells  
Silver bells
