When the hand of fate will slap you  
All has gone array no more bargains  
Death comes out to play  
With a loss of vision control  
All has gone away no more compromise  
Death comes out to play  
In the darkened boneyard  
Ain't no other way  
I will be your captain  
When death comes out to play  
When the hand of fate will drop you  
You have gone astray no more worries  
Death came out to play  
Dear departed he was so damn good  
That the angels knew his name  
He was a giving man a light in the dark  
He was sunshine in the rain  
Smokin', Here we go on one last ride  
Burnin', I will be your captain  
When you're alone and you're chilled to the bone  
The revolution knows your name  
When you're alone and you feel so at home  
Death comes out to play  
Dear departed he was so damn bad  
That the demons ruled his game  
He was a selfish man the devils spark  
The hatred and the pain  
Smokin', When he goes on one last ride  
Burnin', I will be his captain  
When you're alone and you're chilled to the bone  
The revolution knows your name  
When you're alone and you feel so at home  
Death comes out to play  
Dear departed he was so damn bad  
That the demons ruled his game  
He was a selfish man the devils spark  
The hatred and the pain  
Smokin', When he goes on one last ride  
Burnin', I will be his captain  
Walk through the valley naked  
Be not afraid  
Be not afraid  
The hand of fate has dropped you  
Be not afraid
