Fool, whatever you do you remind me  
Fool, wherever you go you won't find me  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
Fool, wherever you go you're a loser  
Such a fool! I want you to know you're a loser  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
Fool, fool  
I'm sure I should pass a law laying down  
Declare, you will never wear your face in a frown  
Obey, or be on your way!  
Get on the first stage out of this town  
There's me and my deputy to shake you down  
If you don't grin, we will take you in  
So spread some sunshine around  
Obey, or be on your way!  
Get on the first stage out of this town
