I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
Won't you forgive me baby  
I'm only human baby  
Won't you forgive me for that?  
Won't you forgive me baby  
I'm only human baby  
Won't you forgive me for that?  
  
Your love can be so strong  
It makes it hard to give some back  
So I try and I try and I give and I give  
And I get so darn excited I can't relax  
Making me the human that I am  
  
I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
When we search for love  
We must be lucky, baby  
And it's because there are many people in the world  
Who think love is not that necessary  
I had you and I blew it all  
  
I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
And now I know for sure  
I must be lucky baby  
You chose me out of all the people in the world  
And I think love is very necessary  
You've forgiven me after all  
?Cause I let you know  
  
I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
Just like you, my love  
Just like you, my baby  
Just like you, my love  
Just like you, my baby  
If you forgive, if you forgive me too
