May she wake in torment  
Never to find  
Any kind of comfort  
In death  
May her lies satanic  
That corrupt even now  
Bring her back to confront  
Me again  
  
These are words of hatred  
Words of contempt  
Only one who suffered  
At the hands and the heart  
Of a woman who stole  
Both his life and soul  
  
Be with me always  
Possess me and haunt me  
Take any form  
Or take none  
Be with me always  
In flesh or as a ghost  
And you'll learn as the ages run  
Learn what your sin has done  
  
Who is my protector?  
Whence comes my help?  
Who is there to calm me  
But she  
God shall be my witness  
That I pray she will know  
Not one moment of rest  
In the cold cold ground  
  
Be with me always  
Consume and invade me  
Take any shape or disguise  
Be with me always  
To share all my despair  
And to learn nothing justifies  
Reckless inhuman lies  
  
Here comes the night  
The abyss unrelenting  
Casting all reason aside  
And I see in myself  
All the things I see in you  
Hear the savage I am crying  
Be with me always...
