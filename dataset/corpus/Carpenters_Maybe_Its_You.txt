Maybe it's you  
Maybe it's me  
Maybe it's just the constant rhythm of the sea  
Maybe it's just that I've never been  
The kind who can pass a lucky penny by  
  
Maybe it's wise  
Maybe it's not  
Maybe it's you who brought the caring I'd forgot  
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way  
That you smile whenever I'm around  
  
Rising on the shore  
The ocean came  
Walks along the waves of velveteen  
His only thought  
Was love for me  
  
Couldn't we stay?  
Or must we go  
Couldn't we stay?  
And watch the splashing rock we throw  
Only a fool would want to leave this paradise  
That I find whenever you're around  
Only a fool  
  
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way  
That you smile whenever I'm around  
Rising on the shore  
The ocean's King  
Walks along the waves of velveteen  
His only thought  
Was love for me  
  
Couldn't we stay?  
Or must you go  
Couldn't we stay?  
And watch the splashing rocks we throw  
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise  
That I find whenever you're around  
Only a fool  
Only a fool
