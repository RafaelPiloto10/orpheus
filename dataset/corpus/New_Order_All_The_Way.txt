It doesn't take a genius  
To tell me what I am  
Or lecture me with poetry  
And tell me that I can  
I don't remember  
What happened yesterday  
But I don't give a damn about  
What all those people say  
  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
  
It don't take no Houdini  
To tell me what I am  
Parasites and literates  
They'd burn me if they can  
But I don't give a damn about  
What those people say  
They pick you up and kick you out  
They hurt you every day  
  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone
