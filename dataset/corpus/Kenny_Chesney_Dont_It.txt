[Verse:]  
13 in the thick of a cornfield  
I learned to fight, kick, roast, tied a knot shoe  
Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train  
My first chance I got out of Smallville  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
My first stop was a pawn shop  
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it  
I had a quick right hand, and an old band  
I thought good friends would make a good band  
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
So there I was, a long way from nowhere  
Frightened mind, spare time and a blank stare  
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang  
After all we didn't share a set of rings  
Besides, how bad could it be!  
She never found out I'd never come clean  
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?  
On-Time ballroom  
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch  
Nobody follows  
Everybody's got their own past  
Skeletons to stash, don't look back if you do laugh  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?
