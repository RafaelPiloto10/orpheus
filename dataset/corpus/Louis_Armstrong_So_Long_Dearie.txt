Dolly  
[Spoken]  
Well, Horace, it looks as if there's nothing more for me to say, but--  
[Sung]  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye.  
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye.  
Don't try to stop me Horace please...  
Wave your little hand and whisper  
So long dearie  
You ain't gonna see me anymore  
But when you discover that your life is dreary  
Don't you come a knockin' at my door  
For I'll be all dolled up  
And singin' that song  
That says you dog, I told you so  
So wave your little hand and whisper  
So long dearie  
Dearie, should have said so long  
So long ago  
  
Because you've treated me so rotten and rough  
I've had enough of feelin' low  
So wave your little hand and whisper  
So long dearie  
Dearie would have said so long  
So long ago  
  
For I can hear that choo choo callin' me on  
To a fancy new address  
Yes, I can hear that choo choo callin' me on  
On board that happiness express  
I'm gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette  
I'm go'n as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get  
  
[Spoken]  
And on those cold winter nights, Horace...  
You can snuggle up to your cash register.  
It's a bit lumpy but it rings!  
  
[Sung]  
Don't come a knockin'  
I'll be all dolled up  
And singin' that song  
That says you dog, I told you so  
So Horace, you will find your life a sad old story  
When you see your Dolly shuffle off to glory  
Oh I should have said so long...  
So Long ago!
