Yeah hell yeah now I can hear the gypsy wind a howlin'  
Ain't got time to lean against your wall  
I gotta hit the road and keep on movin'  
I'm gonna roll and smoke and boogie and ball now  
Been abused, got my shoes, paid my dues, teachin' blues  
Yeah I'm goin' ridin' to the gates of freedom  
Cruisin till the sun she falls  
I'm gonna follow my god into Eden  
While I roll and smoke and boogie and ball  
Light my fuse, get to choose, teachin' blues
