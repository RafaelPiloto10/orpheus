Don't go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Don't send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Haven't I seen you here before?  
Oh  
Watch the puppets dancing  
Yeah  
See the clowns fall down  
Hey  
Tie your tap shoes tightly  
Yeah  
Wear them into town  
See you crawling  
See you crawling  
Don't go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Don't send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Haven't I seen you here before?  
There ain't no heroes here  
No  
No, no more  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh  
Play the game so nicely  
Oh  
Check, it's your move now  
Yeah  
We're standing in this jungle  
Yeah  
With some things I have found  
See you crawling  
See you crawling  
Don't go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Don't send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Haven't I seen you here before?  
Have your heroes disappeared?  
See you crawling  
See you crawling  
So don't go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Don't send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them  
Haven't I seen you here before?  
No, there ain't no heroes here  
No, no  
Haven't I seen you here before?  
No, there ain't no heroes here  
Don't go looking for snakes  
You might find them  
Yeah, haven't I seen you here before?  
Have your heroes disappeared?  
Don't send your eyes to the sun  
You might blind them
