When I first saw you  
I never thought I would love you  
At all, or at least as I do now  
I don't know when it happened or how  
  
When we were best friends, all we did was hang out, laugh, and joke  
Never did I stutter, or choke  
Until just this year, I don't know why  
I became extremely shy  
I look at you and look away  
For I don't know what to say  
  
Now it's the last day of school  
Everyone thinks this day is so cool  
But not for me  
For it is today, that I see  
How dumb I'm being, acting  
While I'm hiding, last year we'd be talking  
The last day, last year,  
You said goodbye, and now we're here  
  
Will it ever be the same?  
Will we ever just sit and talk, it used to be that way  
Now I'm not sure it can come to be  
For I am no longer the old me  
  
I am shy, I am weak  
Seemed to have broken my good-girl streak  
The thing that keeps me going everyday  
Is that you look past all that and see me, the old way  
You see me, and I see you, what's the problem, then?  
I don't know, but I want to be the best friends we used to be
