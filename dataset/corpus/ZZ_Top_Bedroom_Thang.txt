I know you want to be my bedroom thing,  
But you're much too young.  
You're the finest thing I've ever seen.  
You just want to have fun.  
  
I need someone who can scratch my back.  
I need someone who can carry my pack.  
I need someone to be with me at night.  
You're gonna make me feel alright.  
  
Don't you bother me with petty lines,  
I know you ran away from home.  
This might come to you as some surprise,  
I wish you'd leave me alone.  
  
I need someone to scratch my back.  
I need someone to carry my pack.  
I need someone to be with me at night.  
You're gonna make me feel alright.
