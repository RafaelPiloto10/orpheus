Feeling like we're, ready to kick tonight  
No hesitating, my bodies aching  
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right  
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof  
Megaton, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're heading your way like dynamite  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
  
Shake down, rock 'em boys, crack that whip strap mean  
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been  
Stealing your hearts all across the land  
Hot blood doing good, we're going to load you with our brand  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're heading your way like dynamite  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
Yeah, Delivering the goods  
  
Have it your way  
Stealing your hearts  
  
Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is  
Bound to do most damage to your brain  
If you're looking for it mellow  
you're nothing more than yellow  
Gonna do it again and again  
We'll beat you to submission  
So you might as well surrender  
You gotta learn your lesson  
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart  
  
Faster, higher  
'Til it seems that we're gonna break  
Oh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take  
Leaving your heads  
Crushed out on the floor  
Begging for mercy  
Be careful or we'll do it some more  
  
You better watch out and hold on tight  
We're heading your way like dynamite  
Uh, Delivering the goods  
Uh, Delivering the goods
