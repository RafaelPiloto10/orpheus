Choo, choo train chuggin' down the track  
Gotta travel on, never comin' back  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Bye, bye love my baby's leavin' me  
Now lonely teardrops are all that I can see  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Gonna take a trip to lonesome town  
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel  
A fool such as I that never learns  
I cry a tear so well  
  
Choo, choo train chuggin' down the track  
Gotta travel on, never comin' back  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Gonna take a trip to lonesome town  
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel  
A fool such as I that never learns

Choo, choo train chuggin' down the track  
Gotta travel on, never comin' back  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Oh, oh got a one way ticket to the blues
