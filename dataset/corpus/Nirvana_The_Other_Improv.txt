It's an alliance...  
It's another lie... I'd say  
  
Fall in love tonight  
Even if my eyes  
Even though sometime  
I'm burning out tonight  
  
It's another thing that I'll write  
Feeling like I'll die by myself  
Why?  
  
It's mad enough tonight  
And for it's never cold  
  
It's not a right  
When I can, nevermind  
It's all mine...  
It's all mine...  
Inside I hide  
  
But I'd never mind...  
  
Then... I said...  
Minerals will make... The world  
If we did not have chemicals  
You would not be writing my...  
Death...  
Certificate  
  
Fighting is my friend  
My dog left me  
Yes I'm sad  
One more day, then I can climb inside, safe from you?  
  
Fighting isn't my friend  
When I will never have my friend  
Fighting silence as a friend  
I'm silent and I can't turn it around  
  
And she improvised  
Cause she was supervised  
And I was idolized  
I was idolized  
For those... For those... For those...  
I was aroused and fucked  
  
Finally...  
And I...  
Was in my trap  
And I...  
Another guy  
And a knife...  
  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
It's hard and boiled  
  
And sour, all again  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
It revolves, it revolves  
It revolves and around  
And over all  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
With the Ramones  
Come out and smile  
And I'll watch when  
  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your  
My milk is your  
My milk is your shit  
  
My milk is it  
Psst... Got to get all of it  
Cause I can't fight
