Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more no more no more no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
(Oh what'd you say)  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back  
No more no more no more no more  
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more  
Oh woman oh woman oh you treat me so mean  
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen  
I guess if you say so I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)  
Hit the road Jack...  
Now baby listen baby don't you treat me this a way  
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day  
Don't care if you do cause it's understood  
You ain't got no money and you ain't no good  
Well I guess if you say so I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)  
Hit the road Jack...
