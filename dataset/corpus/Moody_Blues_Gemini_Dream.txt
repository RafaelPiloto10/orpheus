Long time no see  
Short time for you and me  
So fine, so good  
We're on the road  
Like you knew we would  
  
First night, so long  
A state of mind  
What can go wrong  
We're here, the time is right  
To rock 'n' roll  
Right through the night  
  
Make it work out  
Make it work  
Make it work out  
Make it work out  
For each other tonight  
  
Stage fright, candle light  
You can't let go  
Tonight's the night  
Came back for you  
Glad to see  
That you came too  
  
There's a place a Gemini dream  
There's no escaping from the love we have seen  
So come with me, turn night today  
You gonna wake up  
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream  
  
Turned round to see  
Where we've been  
And what we believe  
In life, love  
Take a chance  
See it through  
You'll be glad  
That you came too  
  
There's a place a Gemini dream  
There's no escaping from the love we have seen  
So come with me, turn night to day  
You gonna wake up  
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream  
  
Long time no see  
The lights go up  
For you and me  
We're here  
The time is right  
To rock 'n' roll  
Right through the night  
  
Living it  
Believing it  
Wanting it  
Make it work out  
Make it work  
Make it work out  
Make it work out  
For each other tonight  
  
Long time no see  
Short time for you and me  
So fine so far so good  
We're on the road  
Like you knew we would
