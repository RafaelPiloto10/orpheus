Time hurries on, look and it's gone  
The changing of the autumn tide  
The hopes that live, the dreams that die  
If I could have you by my side, I'd give it all away  
You, you and I, we must hold on, we must try  
To reach beyond that far off cloud  
Along the road we're travellin' now  
If I could only show you how, I need you there with me  
Oh, running water, don't care what people say  
We live to love another day  
Oh, running water, don't throw your love away  
We live to love another day  
Time hurries on, turn around and it's gone  
If only we could hold that dream  
If only life was what it seemed  
I know my darling what you mean, I've seen it slip away  
Oh, running water, don't care what people say  
We live to love another day  
Oh, running water, don't throw your love away  
We live to love another day
