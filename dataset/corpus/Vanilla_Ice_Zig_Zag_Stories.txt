[Verse 1]  
I had a zig zag story just the other day  
I rolled a fat blunt and yo, it ripped this way  
I took a puff (uh-huh) and what did I see?  
Those motherfuckers still want to I-see-E  
To blaze up a sac of that green bombay  
And when I reach my peak, I explode like dante  
Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open, I'm soakin'  
In the music, I use it, And don't abuse it  
And true, It gets me high like the sky  
I will buy till the day that I die  
You ain't gotta ask me why  
I take tokes from the smoke, I can't deny  
Got a lifetime supply  
[Chorus]  
And I want to get you high  
Get you high all night  
'cause I want to get you high  
Get you high all night  
And I want to get you high  
Bang another joint  
Zig zag stories  
Bang another joint  
Zig zag stories  
[Verse 2]  
This is a zig zag story that I had last night  
A six-pack, a joint, And I was feeling all right  
Lit up tha chronic, And what did I see?  
This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me  
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second  
I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked  
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane  
Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything  
Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly  
You know I like to fly  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now  
Gotta get myself together, Cause some shit is goin' down  
Hit you people off with my new cd  
Hard to swallow, Like saying "fuck the industry!"  
I'm stompin' through the bayou with my black boots laced  
And takin' out you motherfuckers acting two-faced  
For the people out there gonna blaze 'till I die  
Blaze up the thai  
[Chorus]
