It's kinda hard to wear high heels, or slip on banana peels, how does she get
in and out of tubs  
I hope she doesn't get mad, I hope she thinks this song is good not bad  
'cause we think that she's totally rad, she's Nubs  
  
No fingers no toes she doesn't own elbows, no phalanges no knobby knees to
knock  
She doesn't need knuckles or hands to go see punk rock bands, she's always in
the stands, she's Nubs  
She can't pick up a phone, she can't get dressed alone, she's got no funny
bone, she's Nubs  
No shoes no feet but we sure do think she's neat, she's Nubs, she's Nubs,
she's Nubs  
  
I asked her if she wanted a drink, I asked her if she liked Toronto, I asked
her to go to the bar  
But all she said was no thanks, no and no  
  
It was time for her to leave, so I grabbed and shook her sleeve, and told her
I'd see her at the next club  
She got into a pack, some guy put her on his back, she said goodbye and kinda
waved her stub  
  
She's got beautiful eyes, and breasts regular size, but without calves and
thighs she's Nubs  
It's hard to give good head or get tied to a bed, when all you've got is a
body and head, she's Nubs  
  
She's Nubs, she's Nubs, she's Nubs, she's Nubs, she's Nubs, she's Nubs  
She may not walk the walk, she may not like to talk, but bopy does she know
how to rock  
She's Nubs
