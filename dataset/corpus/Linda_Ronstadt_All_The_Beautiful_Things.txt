The rain doesn't fall on me any more  
The sun doesn't feel as warm as before  
Stars seem far away and fading from sight  
All the beautiful things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now  
  
Close talks, long walks taken with friends  
Getting dirty playing with the neighborhood kids  
Waking up early to see the sun rise  
All the meaningful things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now  
  
Song birds, summer words in my ear  
The fingers of the wind brushing my hair  
The mold on the leaves as they die each year  
The magical things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now
