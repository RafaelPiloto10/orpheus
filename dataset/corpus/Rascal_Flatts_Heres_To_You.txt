They got three in the front and four in the back of a civic  
Camped out all night on the sidewalk just to get tickets  
With their hands on the fence in the back by the buses and the limousines  
Just to get a glance at a drummer or singer yeah anything  
And they come from miles around  
For that moment when the lights go out  
And they scream  
  
It's the girls in the front row singin'  
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them  
Its lighters in the air and you guys up there  
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do  
Here's to you  
  
There's a silver tongued blonde trying to sweet talk her way back stage  
There's a mom and a dad in the aisle not acting their age  
There a wet Corvette red lipstick print a on Coors Light cup  
And judging by the way she's dancing I'd say she's had enough  
  
The guitars come alive  
And you make us wanna stay all night  
And they scream  
  
It's the girls in the front row singin'  
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them  
Its lighters in the air and you guys up there  
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do  
Here's to you, here's to you
