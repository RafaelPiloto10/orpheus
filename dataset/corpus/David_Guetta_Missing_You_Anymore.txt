Have you Fuck up from the last time?  
You think you got everyone figured out  
We are leavin' in a glass house  
Cause everything is shadowing all around  
Now tell me what you mad about  
I'm tired of developing nonsense  
And if you were to leave me now  
I probably do nothing to stop it  
  
I won't be missing you anymore!  
Missing you anymore!  
Missing you anymore!  
Missing you anymore!  
Missing you anymore!  
Touch you little more!  
Not love you anymore!  
Is That what you really want?  
Is That what you really want?

Go-Go-Go on with your game girl
