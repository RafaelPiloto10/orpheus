Everybody seems to know when he's around  
He lifts me up and fades without a sound  
Mr. Sun won't you shine?  
Mr. Sun won't you shine?  
  
Why he's here I will never know  
He makes you know you feel  
Like somewhere to go  
  
Mr. Sun won't you shine?  
Mr. Sun just you shine  
  
Walking with a man called Sun  
I think my journey's just begun  
Do you think he'll mind?  
  
He lifts you up he shines  
And then he's gone  
But you know you need him  
More when he's gone  
  
Mr. Sun just shine  
Mr. Sun just shine  
  
Walking with a man called Sun  
I think my journey's just begun  
Do you think he'll mind?  
  
Shine...  
Shine...  
Shine...  
Shine...  
Let it shine...
