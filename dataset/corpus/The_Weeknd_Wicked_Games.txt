I left my girl back home  
I don't love her no more  
And she'll never fucking know that  
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at  
Let me see that ass  
Look at all this cash  
And I emptied out my cards to  
Now I'm fucking leaning on that  
  
Bring your love baby I could bring my shame  
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain  
I got my heart right here  
I got my scars right here  
Bring the cups baby I could bring the drink  
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame  
And that's my motherfucking words too  
Just let me motherfucking love you  
  
Listen ma I'll give you all I got  
Get me off of this  
I need confidence in myself yeah yeah yeah oh yeah oh  
Listen ma I'll give you all of me  
Give me all of it  
I need all of it to myself  
  
So tell me you love me  
Only for tonight  
Only for one night, even though you don't love me oh oh  
Just tell me you love me  
I'll give you what I need  
I'll give you all of me, even though you don't love me oh oh  
  
Let me see you dance  
I love to watch you dance  
Take you down another level  
And get you dancing with the devil  
Take a shot of this  
But I'm warning you  
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby  
So put down your perfume  
  
Bring your love baby I could bring my shame  
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain  
Oh I got my heart right here  
Oh I got my scars right here  
Bring the cups baby I could bring the drink  
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame  
And that's my motherfucking words too  
So let me motherfucking love you
