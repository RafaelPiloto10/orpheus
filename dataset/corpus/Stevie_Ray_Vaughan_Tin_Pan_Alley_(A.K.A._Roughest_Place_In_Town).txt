Went down to Tin Pan Alley  
See what was going on  
Things was too hot down there  
Couldn't stay very long  
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been  
All the people down there  
Livin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin  
  
I heard a woman scream  
Yeah and I peeped through the door  
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a  
Lord with a two-by-four  
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been  
All the people down there  
Livin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin  
  
I heard a pistol shoot  
Yeah and it was a .44  
Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't  
Shake, rattle, and roll  
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been  
All the people down there  
Killin' for their whiskye, wine, and gin  
  
I saw a cop standing  
With his hand on his gun  
He said "this is a raid, boy  
  
Nobody run"  
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been  
Yeah they took me away from Alley  
Lord they took me right back to the pen
