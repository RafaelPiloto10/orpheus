Sometimes I really want to be alone  
But that's one state I'm never in  
Because I know that I've got millions upon millions  
Of tiny, one-celled organisms living on my skin  
  
(Germs) I rub and scrub until my flesh is raw and bleeding  
(Germs) But they just come right back again  
(Germs) I can't even see'em,  
but I know they're up to something  
Hey, don't touch that - you don't know where it's been!  
  
They're all over me  
They're inside of me  
Can't get'em off a me  
  
I'm covered with... microscopic bacteria  
What do they want from me  
What'll they do to me?  
There's no escape for me  
I'm crawling with microscopic bacteria  
  
Now if I ever dare to go to sleep  
That's when they start their sneak attack  
In the morning I wake up in utter horror  
To find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque  
  
(Germs) Can't get those parasitic creatures off my face  
(Germs) And there's more comin' every day  
(Germs) I never said that they could camp out on my body  
I wish they'd pack their tiny little bags and move away  
  
They're all over me  
They're inside of me  
Can't get'em off a me  
I'm covered with... microscopic bacteria  
What do they want from me  
What'll they do to me?  
There's no escape for me  
I'm crawling with microscopic bacteria  
  
They're creepin' around my shorts  
They're under the bathroom sink  
They're ridin' inside my car  
They're swimmin' in every drink  
They're hidin' between my toes  
They're lurkin' in every kiss  
I got'em way up my nose  
In every orifice  
I'm gonna show them who's boss  
I'm gonna get even yet  
Just gimme some Lysol spray  
Just hand me a moist towelette  
Don't tell me I'm paranoid  
I know that they're after me  
Look under the microscope  
See??  
  
They're all over me  
They're inside of me  
Can't get'em off a me  
I'm covered with microscopic bacteria  
What do they want from me  
What'll they do to me?  
There's no escape for me  
I'm crawling with microscopic bacteria  
  
They're all over me  
I can feel'em all over me  
Over every part of me  
Microscopic bacteria  
I know they're watching me  
They're always watching me  
They're coming after me  
Microscopic bacteria  
Won't somebody help  
Please somebody help me  
You've got to believe me  
They're out to get me  
They want to control me  
They want to destroy me  
They're tryin' to kill me  
It kind of upsets me
