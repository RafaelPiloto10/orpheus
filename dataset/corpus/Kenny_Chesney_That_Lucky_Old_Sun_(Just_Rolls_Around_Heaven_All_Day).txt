Up in the morning  
Out on the job  
Work like the devil for my pay  
Lucky old sun  
Aint got nothing to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
Fuss with my woman  
Toil for my kids  
Sweat til I am wrinkled and grey  
But that lucky old sun  
Aint got nothin to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear lord above  
Can't you see I'm cryin  
Tears are in my eyes  
Send down a cloud with a silver lining  
Take me to paradise  
  
Show me that river  
Lead me across  
And take all my troubles away  
Like the lucky old sun  
I'll have nothin to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear lord above  
Can't you see I'm cryin  
Tears are in my eyes  
Send down a cloud with a silver lining  
Take me to paradise  
  
Show me that river  
Lead me across  
And take all my troubles away  
Like the lucky old sun  
I'll have nothin to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
But roll around heaven all day...
