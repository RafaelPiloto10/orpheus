(i'm not cheating)  
  
Oooh, oooh  
Everything is dinky doo  
Everything you do  
You, the king of la-di-da  
Pretty very out far  
Never oversits, he understands  
Like the back of the hand  
He should sing in a band, oh yeah  
  
Oooh, oooh  
People think he's loopey loo  
And when they look at his shoes  
He's a rocking sausage roll  
He gets it in the goal  
Healthy little 'brown affair'  
And when he washes his hair  
He'll get a round or a square  
Get them singing  
  
Oooh, oooh  
Everyone from oxford town  
Way down to the rio grande  
  
Knows his harbour quays  
His skin tight hands, without seggs  
His name is legs  
  
[talking]  
  
Oooh, oooh  
Coolies sweating in hong kong  
Run along to the mardi grass  
  
Risking asian flu to meet the man  
Who lays the eggs  
His name is legs  
  
He's a cure for whooping cough  
And if the going gets rough  
Get lined up, come sikh, come czar  
No matter who you are  
We could get along and slide a rule  
And if you don't play fools  
While larry plays pool  
You'll hear him singing  
  
Oooh, oooh  
[talking]  
Oooh, oooh
