Well I used to smile when I was a pup  
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup  
With the recipe for a lovely day  
Sticking out of my back pocket  
  
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight  
We used to fight like cats and dogs  
But we made it up in the ballroom  
  
[Chorus]  
Ballroom dancing made a man of me  
One, two, three, four  
I just plain adore your  
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV  
I got what I got from ballroom dancing  
Big b.d.  
  
Well I used to fly when I was a kid  
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit  
On a carpet ride to a foreign land  
At the time of Davy Crockett  
  
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight  
We used to fight like cats and dogs  
Till we made it up in the ballroom  
  
Ballroom dancing made a man of me  
One, two, three, four  
I just plain adore your  
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV  
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing  
Big b.d.  
  
Well went so fast and we all grew up  
Now the days that passed in the china cup  
Are the memories of another day  
And I wouldn't want to knock it  
  
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight  
We used to fight like cats and dogs  
But we made it up in the ballroom  
  
Ballroom dancing made a man of me  
One, two, three, four  
I just plain adore your  
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV  
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing  
Big b.d.
