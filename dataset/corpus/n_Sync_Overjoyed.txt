Over time, I've been building my castle of love, oh  
Just for two  
Though you never knew you were my reason  
I've gone much too far for you now to say  
That I've got to throw my castle away  
Over dreams  
Over dreams  
I have picked out a perfect come true  
Though you never knew it was of you  
I've been dreaming  
The sandman has come from too far away  
For you to say come back some other day  
And though you don't believe that they do  
They do come true  
For did my dreams  
Come true when I looked at you  
And maybe too, if you would believe  
You too might be  
Overjoyed, over loved, over me  
Overjoyed, over loved, over me  
And though the odds say improbable  
What do they know  
For in romance  
All true love needs is a chance  
And maybe with a chance you will find  
You too like I  
Overjoyed, over loved, over you  
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
