Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I will fear no evil -- for you are with me  
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me  
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies  
You annoint my head with oil, my cup overflows  
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life  
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever  
  
Niggaz in my faction don't like askin questions  
Strictly gun testin, coke measurin  
Givin pleasure in the Benz-ito  
Hittin fanny, spendin chips at Manny's  
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease  
MWA, may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours  
Four-four, and fifty-four draw  
as my pilot, steers my Leer, yes my dear  
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear  
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin  
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin  
So don't you get suspicious  
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious  
As I leave my competition, respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success escalator style  
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death  
controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh  
I spit phrases that'll thrill you  
You're nobody til somebody kills you  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
Uhh, uhh  
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino  
Ask Nino, he know  
Green with envy, the green tempts me  
to make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese  
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty  
live happily, ever after in laughter  
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster  
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead  
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do  
but tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed  
Incidents like this I take trips  
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)  
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour  
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore  
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin  
buy me lavender and fuschia Gators  
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters  
Rich bitch shit, drinkin Cristal  
til they piss the shit, uhh  
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches  
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me  
Reminesce on dead friends too  
You're nobody til somebody kills you  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
Uhh, uhh  
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)  
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit  
You ain't worth spit, just a memory  
Remember he, used to push the champagne Range (I remember that)  
Silly cat, all suede in the rain  
Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame  
before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane  
I can't recall his name (what was his name?) you mean that kid  
that nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?  
Gettin his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine  
A fuckin shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?  
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean?  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
