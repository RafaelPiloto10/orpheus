I see your face looking into the space,  
All tired and worried.  
Why does it have to be like this, you and I,  
I wanted us to be happy.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
I see your face with a trace of life,  
Being a wife and a woman.  
If I ever hurt you, please, remember,  
I wanted you to be happy.  
  
Is there anything I want more,  
More than your trust and understanding?  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
I wanna quit moving,  
I wanna quit running,  
I wanna relax and be tender.  
I wanna see us together again,  
Rocking away in our walnut chairs.  
  
Even with your warmth and closeness,  
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a curse.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
Even with our dreams and yearnings,  
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a thirst.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.
