I was getting used to you  
You went and changed your tune  
Now you've got me so confused  
I can't tell the salt from the wound  
Didn't they always used to say  
A man ain't supposed to cry  
I defy you to look me in the eye  
And tell me you're a friend of mine  
Poisonous lookalike  
You're not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her?  
Poisonous lookalike  
You're not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her?  
Now it seems to me you're acting strange  
You treat me like a criminal  
You keep telling me  
I'll have to change  
Baby, that would take a miracle  
Didn't they always used to say  
A man ain't supposed to cry  
I defy you to look me in the eye  
And tell me you're a friend of mine  
Poisonous lookalike  
You're not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her?  
Poisonous lookalike  
You're not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her?  
Poisonous lookalike  
Little Miss Gun-to-a-Knife fight  
Poisonous lookalike  
What're you trying to do?  
Poisonous lookalike  
Do you feel all right all right?  
Poisonous lookalike  
What's wrong with you?  
Poisonous lookalike  
You're not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her?  
Poisonous lookalike  
You're not my girl  
Poisonous lookalike  
What have you done with her?
