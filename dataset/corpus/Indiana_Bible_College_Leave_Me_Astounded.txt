Verse 1  
  
All my hands have made I'm laying down  
All that I hold dear, my many crowns  
I've tasted and seen of Your great love  
You satisfy me  
You satisfy me  
  
Chorus  
  
Spirit fall, open up heaven's door  
We're waiting with worship for more  
You're the only one that satisfies me  
  
Verse 2  
  
My constant request above all things  
Every hour I wake, be near me, oh God  
Though I've tasted and seen of Your great love  
Show me Your glory  
Show me Your glory  
  
Chorus  
  
Spirit fall, open up heaven's door  
We're waiting with worship for more  
You're the only one that satisfies me  
Lord we run into Your loving arms  
We're safe and secure in Your love  
You're the only one that satisfies me  
  
Bridge  
  
Leave me astounded, leave me amazed  
Show off Your glory, let heaven invade  
We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise  
For the almighty presence of God to invade

We're safe and secure in Your love  
You're the only one that satisfies me  
  
Bridge  
  
Leave me astounded, leave me amazed  
Show off Your glory, let heaven invade  
We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise
