Sheepdog, standing in the rain  
Bullfrog, doing it again  
Some kind of happiness is  
Measured out in miles  
What makes you think you're  
Something special when you smile  
  
Childlike no one understands  
Jackknife in your sweaty hands  
Some kind of innocence is  
Measured out in years  
You don't know what it's like  
To listen to your fears  
  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
If you're lonely, you can talk to me  
  
Big man (yeah) walking in the park  
Wigwam frightened of the dark  
Some kind of solitude is  
Measured out in you  
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue  
  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
If you're lonely, you can talk to me  
  
Hey Hey  
  
Roar  
  
Hey, Bulldog (Hey Bulldog)  
  
Woof  
  
Hey, Bulldog  
Hey, Bulldog  
Hey, Bulldog

Woah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ha ha ha ha

Quiet!  
Hey, Bulldog, Hey Bulldog
