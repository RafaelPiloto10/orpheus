Driven up and down in circles  
Skidding down a road of black ice  
Staring in and out storm windows  
Driven to a fool's paradise  
  
But it's my turn to drive  
  
Driven to the margin of error  
Driven to the edge of control  
Driven to the margin of terror  
Driven to the edge of a deep, dark hole  
  
Driven day and night in circles  
Spinning like a whirlwind of leaves  
Stealing in and out back alleys  
Driven to another den of thieves  
  
But it's my turn to drive  
  
Driven in --- Driven to the edge  
Driven out --- On the thin end of the wedge  
Driven off --- By things I've never seen  
Driven on --- By the road to somewhere I've never been  
  
It's my turn to drive  
  
The road unwinds towards me  
What was there is gone  
The road unwinds before me  
And I go riding on
