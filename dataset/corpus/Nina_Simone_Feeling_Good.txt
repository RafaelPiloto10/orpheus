Birds flying high you know how I feel  
Sun in the sky you know how I feel  
Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel.  
  
It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life for me yeah  
  
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me  
Ouh  
And I'm feeling good  
  
Fish in the sea you know how I feel  
River running free you know how I feel  
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel  
  
It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life  
For me  
And I'm feeling good  
  
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know  
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean  
Sleep in peace when day is done that's what I mean  
And this old world is a new world  
And a bold world for me  
  
Stars when you shine you know how I feel  
Scent of the pines you know how I feel  
Oh freedom is mine  
And I know how I feel  
  
It's a new dawn  
It's a new day  
It's a new life  
For me  
  
And I'm feeling good
