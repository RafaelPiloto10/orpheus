I know you're around when the sky and the ground start in ringing  
I know you're around by the thunder I hear in advance  
Your words and your words alone are the words that start my heart singing  
And yours is the only music that makes me dance  
  
You'll sleep and you'll rise in the light of two eyes that adore you  
Bore you it might, but you won't leave my sight or glance  
In every way, every day, I need less of myself and need more you, more you  
Yours is the only music that makes me dance  
  
In every way, every day I need less of myself, and need more you, more you  
Yours is the only music that makes me dance
