I'll survive you, I will survive you  
Well, it's too late, I know, to change the way we go  
From this day on I want to stay on  
Now that I've started learning  
And the tides started turning  
Well, it's here I want to stay  
  
[ Chorus: ]  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
I'm alive here, I can survive dear  
Though the weather might change  
From the wind to the rain  
Well, my heart remains the same  
  
[ Chorus: ]  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
Looked out on a sea of trouble  
And I tried to stall for awhile  
It's so hard to answer every question  
And it's hard to protect your heart anymore  
  
[ Chorus x3 ]  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival (I am alive)  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival (but I wonder)  
Where do we go from here  
  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival (I am alive)  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival (but I wonder)  
Where do we go from here  
  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival (I am alive)  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival (but I wonder)  
Where do we go from here
