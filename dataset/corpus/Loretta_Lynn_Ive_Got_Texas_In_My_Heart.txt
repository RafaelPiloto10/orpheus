I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces  
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather  
I crave the smell of good ole saddle leather I've got Texas in my heart  
I've got a lotta friends in Amarrilo I like Dallas Forth Worth Houston San
Antone  
Got a pinin' in my heart to be in Texas I've said I'll wind up makin' it my
home  
I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces  
The Lone Star State has won my heart doggone it  
And long horn steak with lots of ketchup on it I've got Texas in my heart  
[ banjo ]  
I love the western way they grab in Texas where that Lone Star hat is mighty
plain  
You can bet your boots and saddle I love Texas gonna hang and to go back there
again  
I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces  
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather  
I crave the smell of good old saddle leather I've got Texas in my heart  
(The eyes of Texas are upon you) I've got Texas in my heart
