Yeah miss you  
  
Tonight I feel so cold and lonely  
And baby you're so far away  
The space between us keeps on growing  
How I wish that you could hear me when I say  
  
No no no no no no no  
Wish you hear me saying  
No no no no no no no  
Oh I miss you oh I miss you  
Oh baby since you walked away  
Oh I miss you oh I miss you  
I miss you more and more each day  
  
Now tell me do you think about me  
'Cause I think about you all the time yeah  
Only miles just stand between us  
And I don't wanna stop until you die  
  
No no no no no no no  
Wish you can hear me saying  
  
No no no no no no no  
Oh I miss you oh I miss you  
Oh baby since you walked away  
Oh I miss you oh I miss you  
I miss you more and more each day  
  
(Spanish)  
  
No no no no no no no  
Wish you hear me saying  
No no no no no no no  
Oh I miss you oh I miss you  
Oh baby since you walked away  
Oh I miss you oh I miss you  
I miss you more and more each day  
  
[Repeat x3]  
I miss you more and more each day  
I miss you more and more each day  
I miss you more and more each day
