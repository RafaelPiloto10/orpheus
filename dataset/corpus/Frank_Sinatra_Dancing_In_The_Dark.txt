Dancin' in the dark 'til the tune ends  
We're dancin' in the dark and it soon ends  
We're waltzin' in the wonder of why we're here  
Time hurries by, we're here, and we're gone  
Lookin' for the light of a new love  
To brighten up the night, I have you love  
And we can face the music together  
Dancing in the dark  
What though love is old  
What though song is old  
Through them we can be young  
Hear this heart of mine  
Wailin' all the time  
Dear one, tell me that we're one  
Lookin' for the light of a new love  
To brighten up the night I have you love  
And we can face the music together  
Dancin' in the dark  
Dancin' in the dark  
Dancin' in the dark
