Ain't this what you came for  
Don't you wish you came, oh  
Girl what you're playing for  
Come on, let me kiss that  
Ooh, I know you miss that  
What's wrong, let me fix that  
Twist that  
  
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know  
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control  
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that  
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had  
  
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be  
The best you ever had  
  
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be  
The best you ever had  
  
I hit you with the best flow,  
Freestlying in the restroom  
Til you blowing cigarette smoke  
And now the bad's gone  
So what we gon' do now  
F-ck it, round two now  
Work it out, then we cool down  
Cool down  
  
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know  
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control  
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that  
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had  
  
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be  
The best you ever had  
  
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be  
The best you ever had  
  
[Ludacris rap verse]  
  
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know  
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control  
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that  
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had  
  
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be  
The best you ever had  
  
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be  
The best you ever had
