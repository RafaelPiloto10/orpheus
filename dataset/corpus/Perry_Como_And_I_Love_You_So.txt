And I love you so  
The people ask me how  
How I've lived till now  
I tell them I don't know  
  
I guess they understand  
How lonely life has been  
But life began again  
The day you took my hand  
  
And yes, I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me 'n' the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening get me down  
Now that you're around me  
  
And you love me, too  
Your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free  
I'm happy that you do  
  
The book of life is brief  
And once a page is read  
All but life is dead  
That is my belief  
  
And yes, I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening get me down  
Now that you're around me
