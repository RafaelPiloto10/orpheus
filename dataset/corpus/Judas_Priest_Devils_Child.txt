Hypnotize me  
Mesmerize me  
Feel my willpower slip  
Light my fire  
With cold desire  
Losing all my grip  
  
Eat my diamonds  
Drinking all my gin  
Feast your eyes on  
A whole lotta sin  
  
Oh no you're so damned wicked  
You got me by the throat  
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me  
You never let me go  
I believe you're the devil  
I believe you're the devil's child  
  
Took my dreams  
And now it's seems you're nothing but a liar  
Smash and grab at all I had  
Build my funeral pyre  
Stop pretendin'  
Got me growin' old  
Your tormentin's  
Fit to snap my soul  
  
Oh no you're so damned wicked  
You got me by the throat  
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me  
You never let me go  
I believe you're the devil  
I believe you're the devil's child  
  
You took my heart  
And left it blown to smithereens  
I gave my body as a slave  
You cut my flesh  
And drank my blood that poured in streams  
I'm left here broken and ashamed  
  
Goin' under  
Hear the thunder  
Death defying grace  
Your condition breeds ammunition  
Shoots me in the face  
Vicious talkin'  
Stabs me like a knife  
Scratched and bruised, so abused  
I'm a human sacrifice  
  
Oh no you're so damned wicked  
You got me by the throat  
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me  
You never let me go  
I believe you're the devil  
I believe you're the devil's child
