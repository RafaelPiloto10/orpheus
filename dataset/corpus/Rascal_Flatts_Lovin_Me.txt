Now there are days when I don't have a clue where to find me  
My shadow feels like a stranger lagging behind me  
I feel like a king of I can't get a break, bad timing  
But the reason, the questions and my second guessing  
Don't hang around to long  
  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
I can step right into the great unknown  
And always find my way back home  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
  
It's so crazy no matter how much you pour in  
You seem to find a way to fit a little bit more in  
You smile that smile and it feels like a brand new morning  
You're bound and determine and I don't deserve it  
But God knows where I'd be  
  
If you didn't keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
I can step right into the great unknown  
And always find my way back home  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
  
Life can take you, turn you, twist you right in two,  
Oh bring it on  
I've got you  
  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
(You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby)  
(You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby)  
I can step right into the great unknown  
And always find my way back home  
You keep lovin' me  
You keep lovin' me  
You keep lovin' me  
Oh baby
