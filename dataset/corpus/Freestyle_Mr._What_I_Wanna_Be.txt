I everyone has A friend of their own  
Someone that we can look up to  
Mine is like no one I'Ve ever known  
He'S not like me, he'S not like you  
Ii while you and I climb the ladder high  
He looks into the horizon  
He asks me " boy, what are you tryin' to find? "  
Then I realize my journey'S just begun...  
Chorus I  
Everybody, say "Hello" to this friend of mine  
He'S standing here, right inside of me  
And everybody, he'S the one who'S always on my mind  
He'S somebody you don'T see...  
Iii knowing what'S good, and what is right from wrong  
He always seeks to find it  
The choice between coin and candy for the soul  
He needs nobody to remind him  
Iv he always packs his bag with honesty  
Specially to show to himself  
A tank-Full of courage and humility  
So he won'T get lost, tryin' to be somebody else  
Chorus ii  
Everybody, say " hello" to this friend of mine  
He'S standing here, right inside of me  
And everybody, he'S the one who'S always on my mind  
He'S somebody you don'T see...  
His name is mr. What- I - wanna - be  
His name is mr. What- I - wanna - be  
Bridge  
And the race goes on, and on, and on  
The race for truth in A world of lies  
Life is not just what we have known  
In A world full of blindness,  
Now I wanna see with both my eyes  
Repeat chorus ii  
Coda  
I am learning  
I am learning from someone  
Never stop learning  
Until he and I are one
