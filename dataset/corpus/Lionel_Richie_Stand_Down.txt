People are in confusion  
The world is full of fear  
I see conflict all around us  
Can anybody out there hear  
I hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
  
I see the poor and hungry  
I see the pain they bear  
Where is the hope they long for  
Does anybody out there care  
I hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
  
We all must find one reason  
We all must find one cause  
For everyone to come together  
And give this world a voice  
Can't you hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love
