For so long now, I'm racing on in the wind  
On this road, I'm moving on  
I feel her heat, the desert sun burning skin  
Never stopping, always on the run  
Ooh, forever all I want is you here by my side  
But I can't wait too long, no  
Holding me is like taming the seven seas  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
I want restless gypsy, all I need  
Is to catch the wind, where my heart's in  
And I'm riding in the breeze  
Call me restless gypsy, to the end  
Riding free - is all I need  
My spirit's in the wind  
  
Move too fast no never hold me down  
Catch me if you really think you can  
Feel my touch, two lovers, cry that sound  
Never ever knowing who I am  
Ooh, I want you closer, baby, don't you take too long  
'Cause tomorrow I'll be gone, yeah  
And holding me is like holding the seven seas  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Easy rider on the highway  
Got the wind in my hair  
Come on, you can touch me where I lay  
Running free without a care  
  
Come on, restless gypsy, all I need  
Is to catch the wind, where my heart's in  
And I'm riding in the breeze  
Call me, restless gypsy, to the end  
Riding free - is all I need  
My spirit's in the wind
