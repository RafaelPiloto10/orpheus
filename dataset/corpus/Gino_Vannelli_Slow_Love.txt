I want some slow love  
The kind that lasts forever  
The kind of love that will be there in the morning  
I want some slow love  
The kind that leaves me never  
The kind of love that lasts a long long time  
Now don't mistake my coolness for a cold heart  
I want you more than you should know  
It's just these days I'm not inclined to move so fast  
Why don't you stay a while say a hundred years or so  
And make some slow love  
The kind that lasts forever  
The kind of love that will be there in the morning  
I want some slow love  
The kind that leaves me never  
The kind of love that lasts a long long time  
I'm not inclined to live a lifetime in one night  
Although I long to touch I yearn for much, much more  
A slow love  
The kind that lasts forever  
The kind of love that will be there in the morning  
I want some slow love  
The kind that leaves me never  
The kind of love I thought I'd never find  
The kind of love that lasts a long time
