In Havana every Cubana shakes her bandana to the La Conga.  
It's a new dance, something new to dance  
Wait till you dance to the La Conga.  
  
Wait till you hear the beat of the bonga.  
Just get that beat and you get the Conga.  
It delights you and it excites you and it invites you to do the La Conga.  
  
In Buenos Aires and London and Paris they Tango.  
In old Vienna their favorite has long been a waltz.  
In Wiakill in Madrid and Seville they Fandango.  
But in Havana all the maidens go 1, 2, 3, Boom,  
1, 2, 3, boom, 1, 2, 3, boom 1, 2, 3, boom.  
  
In Hava-vana every Cubana shakes her bandana to the La Conga.  
It's a new dance, something new to dance  
Wait till you dance to the La Conga.  
  
The La Cong...of the Bonga. ya da da get the Conga  
Do ya ralla do ya ralla ralla da do do do Conga.  
It delights you and it excites you and it invites you to do the La Conga.
