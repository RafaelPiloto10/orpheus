Have you been headwired?  
Were you satisfied?  
Did it free the feelings in your spine?  
Sleeping way inside all this time  
  
Will your meet your mind  
Where the night collides?  
Will you greet yourself  
When the sun arrives?  
  
I'll just stay behind  
I've met mine  
  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
  
Help you feed the wires  
When your head unwinds?  
And if our headlines become entwined  
You can have all mine  
I'll be fine  
  
There's a reason why  
Keeping me alive  
There's a cure in me  
That I wish were mine  
As long as I can fight, I'll survive  
  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
  
Stationed on the wire  
One day I'll let go  
Tell them all 'Hello'  
Tell them all 'Hello'  
  
The sun is on  
Arlandria  
  
Headwires
