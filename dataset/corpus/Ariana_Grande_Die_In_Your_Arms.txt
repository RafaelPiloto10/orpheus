Say you love me, as much as I love you, yeah  
Would you hurt me baby?  
Would you do this to me? Yeah  
Would you lie to me baby?  
Cause the truth hurts so much more  
  
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?  
Leave my heart still at the door  
  
Oh I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That will break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
Cause everytime you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Oh but it feels so right  
So baby, baby, please don't stop, boy  
  
Oh, baby, I know loving you aint easy  
But it sure is worth a try  
  
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool  
Cause I love too hard  
Are there any rules?  
  
If this is a lesson  
Baby teach me to behave  
Just tell me what I gotta do  
Just to stay right next to you  
  
Oh I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That will break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
Cause everytime you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Oh but it feels so right  
So baby, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl  
  
Basically I'm saying here  
I can't live without my baby  
Loving you is so damn easy for me  
  
Aint no need for contemplating  
Promise me you wont keep me waiting  
Tell me baby I'm all that you need  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
Cause everytime you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Oh but it feels so right  
So baby, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl  
  
If I could die
