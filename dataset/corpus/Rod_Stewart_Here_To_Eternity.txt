On a hot summer's night  
In the year of '75  
Jimmy Doyle took his child bride  
Amanda, for a drive  
She was only seventeen  
He just lived to see her smile  
Their commitment to each other  
Burned like a forest fire  
Otis on the radio singing Stand By Me  
  
As a trooper pulled them over  
And said Jimmy where you been  
Someone matching your description  
Has just robbed the liquor store  
Amanda said He's been with me  
But they weren't listening anymore  
Down at Precinct Number Five  
They questioned Jimmy through the night  
The sheriff said He's gotta stand trial  
Armed robbery is the charge  
Amanda said This cannot be  
Gonna stay right here until you set him free  
And I love him  
  
Here to eternity  
Forever  
Unto eternity  
Oh God gave me something  
I must hold on to  
Gonna hold on him  
No matter what you do  
The old courthouse was crowded  
As the judge reviewed the case  
In a year of re-election  
He was desperate to impress  
Innocent or guilty  
  
He saw an opportunity  
To send Jimmy down for life  
To the Penitentiary  
Disbelief and anger  
As they dragged him away  
In a cell below the courthouse  
They beat him like a slave  
But his use of martial arts  
Struck a blow for liberty  
Felled a guard with a fist of iron  
And killed him instantly  
All the press surrounded Amanda  
Coming down the courthouse steps  
Pleading for her young man's life  
And in a moment seen by millions  
She bowed her head and cried  
Show my man some mercy  
He's the father of my child  
I love him  
  
Here to eternity  
Forever  
Unto eternity  
Oh God gave me something  
I must hold on to  
Gonna hold on him  
No matter what you do  
I love him  
Here to eternity  
Jimmy Doyle appeared again  
In a second public trail  
For the murder of a prison guard  
They sentenced him to die  
But Amanda with her long red hair  
Made one last plea  
As the court fell into silence  
She cried out desperately  
This man of mine is innocent  
As one day I shall prove  
It's an open case of self defense  
All this circumstantial evidence  
You place before your court  
Has robbed me of my husband  
Forget I will not  
I love him  
  
Here to eternity  
Forever  
Unto eternity  
Oh goodbye my Jimmy  
'Til we meet again  
In a better world than this  
I swear I'll clear your name  
'Cause I love you  
Here to eternity
