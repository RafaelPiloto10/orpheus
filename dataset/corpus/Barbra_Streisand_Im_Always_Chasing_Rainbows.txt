I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
  
Some fellas look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
Some fellas make a winning sometime  
I never even make a game, believe me  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
And waiting to find a little bluebird in vain  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
And waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
