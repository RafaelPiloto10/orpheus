And another life  
Maybe we see everything  
In a different light  
Like an endless summer  
And in the years from now  
We'll all be living  
The same old certain dream  
That we imagined would be  
  
Somewhere high  
Somewhere high above the clouds  
We could live there safe and sound  
Far away from where we are  
Yeah we'll find our star  
But maybe that's another world  
  
In another life  
We would fall in love you see  
And the sun would shine  
For you and me yeah  
Chasing the storm from the sky  
Altogether love would come and save us  
And we would let it take us  
  
Somewhere high  
Somewhere high above the clouds  
We could live there safe and sound  
Far away from where we are  
Yeah we'll find our star  
But maybe that's another world  
  
Far away from where we are  
Yeah we'll find our star  
But maybe that's another world
