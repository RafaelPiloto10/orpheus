I'm an animal  
I'm the victim  
I'm the answer to your prayers  
I'm a witness  
I'm a witch hunt  
I'm the monster under stairs  
I'm the ghost that's in the mirror  
I'm everything that you fear  
I'm the rip tide  
I'm the soul shock  
I'm the voice that's in your head  
  
I've seen it all  
Still can't taste it  
Smashed to the wall  
Brought me to my knee  
I've done it all  
Fucked up wasted  
Still in my blood  
Now inside I'm seeing  
  
I'm the hunted  
I'm the predator  
I'm the answer to the riddle  
I'm the off beat  
I'm the head fuck  
I'm the way that's left of the middle  
I'm the player  
I'm denying  
I'm the one whose not addicted  
I'm the logic to the fuck up  
I'm the broken one who fixed it  
  
I've seen it all  
Still can't taste it  
Smashed to the wall  
Brought me to my knee  
I've done it all  
Fucked up wasted  
Still in my blood  
Now inside I'm seeing  
  
I'm just a child  
With a tear in it's eyes  
I am holding this gift  
That is broken  
What do I have left now?  
  
I've seen it all  
Still can't taste it  
Smashed to the wall  
Brought me to my knee  
I've done it all  
Fucked up wasted  
Still in my blood  
Now inside I'm seeing
