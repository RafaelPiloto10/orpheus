Do you know about a day  
That's not so very far away  
Everywhere there's orange and black  
And chills are running up your back.  
  
Jack-o-lanterns and ghosts and bats,  
Witches and goblins and big black cats  
Spooky spooks come out to play  
On the thirty-first, Halloween Day.  
  
Let's pick a costume we can wear  
And all the neighbors, we will scare  
When at their door we trick or treat  
And they will give us something sweet.  
  
Jack-o-lanterns and ghosts and bats,

Today is a super busy day at school, but in between trick-or-treating
throughout the building, visiting the "haunted hallway" complete with a
"graveyard", and celebrating at a huge party in the gym this afternoon, we'll
find some time to squeeze in music therapy.  
  
Though my feelings toward Halloween are lukewarm at best, I am trying my best
to get into the spirit for the sake of those who enjoy this spooktacular day.
Tonight, Zach (my husband) and I are going to attend a Halloween party dressed
as a certain singing duo... any guesses? (Hint: if only I had an autoharp, my
costume would be perfect.)
