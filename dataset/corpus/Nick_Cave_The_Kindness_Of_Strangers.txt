They found mary bellows cuffed to the bed  
With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head  
O poor mary bellows  
She'd grown up hungry, she'd grown up poor  
She left her home in arkansas  
O poor mary bellows  
She wanted to see the deep blue sea  
She travelled across tennessee  
O poor mary bellows  
She met a man along the way  
He introduced himself as richard slade  
O poor mary bellows  
Poor mary thought that she might die  
When she saw the ocean for the first time  
O poor mary bellows  
She checked into a cheap little place  
Richard slade carried in her old suitcase  
O poor mary bellows  
I'm a good girl, sir, she said to him  
I couldn't possibly permit you in  
O poor mary bellows  
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye  
And turned away without goodbye  
O poor mary bellows  
She sat on her bed and thought of home  
With the sea breeze whistling all alone  
O poor mary bellows  
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor  
And undid the latch on the front door  
O poor mary bellows  
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed  
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head  
O poor mary bellows  
So mothers keep your girls at home  
Don't let them journey all alone  
Tell them this world is full of danger  
And to shun the company of strangers  
O poor mary bellows  
O poor mary bellows
