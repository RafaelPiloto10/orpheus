When you tell me that you're leaving  
And that you've got to be alone  
Sometimes you seem to me like you're far away  
In some different danger zone  
I couldn't stop you if I wanted  
You found somebody else for sure  
What you don't know is I've found some love  
Like some revolving door  
Yeah  
Temptation's gonna come into our lives  
Gonna break up our happy home  
Temptation  
Me and you are going through it  
And we should know better  
To leave that thing alone  
You always seem to be distracted  
Just like your mind is somewhere else  
If you don't want to be alone with some strange guy  
You're gonna wind up on the shelf  
Yeah  
Temptation's gonna come into our lives  
Gonna break up our happy home  
Temptation  
Me and you are going through it  
And we should know better  
Yeah yeah  
To leave that thing alone  
Temptation's gonna go into our lives  
Gonna break up our happy home  
Temptation  
Me and you are going through it  
And we should know better  
Yeah yeah  
Temptation's gonna go into our lives  
Gonna break up our happy home  
Temptation  
Me and you are going through it  
And we should know better  
Yeah yeah  
Oh
