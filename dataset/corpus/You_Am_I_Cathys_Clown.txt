The weightlifter and a library tech you know  
Made a big decision in the magazine row  
I'll open my catalogue just enough to let you in  
And she'll drop beers like you drop vitamins  
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?  
Was you ever thinking that you'd be Cathy's clown now, she's around?  
The protein pills and the G-strings you left in her flat  
Are just enough to get your Dewey Decimal back  
You lift her to work, just before your daily workout begins  
And she'll stack up like you stack vitamins  
Did you ever never wanna let somebody down?  
Was you ever thinking that you'd be Cathy's clown, now she's around? Hey!
