Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Catherine the Great and brave Ulysses  
Playin' checkers out in the sun.  
Jesse James and young William Bonnie  
Have started a religion for everyone.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Well the drums they are loud down in rap town,  
But the Pope has been quiet for days.  
Well some gunmen robbed a bank in California  
And the cops blew them all away.  
If you don't like the picture don't turn it off.  
The only way to change it is to do it yourself.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Peace and love on the wings of a dove  
Has flown away.  
We're payin' the rent  
On the blood that's been spent,  
On a mortgage that's too high to be paid.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.
