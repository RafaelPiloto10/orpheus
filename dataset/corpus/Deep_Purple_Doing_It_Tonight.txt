I don't have a problem  
I'm not seeking her advice  
I'm saving that for later  
Yeh, it's something awful nice  
I had a shaky feeling  
When she floated into sight  
I imagine we'll be doing it tonight  
  
I'm ragged round the edges  
All these people in the room  
There's magic in the air  
I'm guessing she can feel it too  
Prospective recreation  
Helps me keep her in my sight  
I imagine we'll be doing it tonight  
  
That's why everybody's sitting around  
We can't think of nothing better to do  
There's no empty bottle  
They're all half full  
So we end up spinning a shoe  
  
We keep on going 'til poor old Lenny's  
Got drool hanging off of his chin  
He can't stop winning  
When the shoe stops spinning  
But he doesn't know where to begin  
  
She wasn't in the running  
She was never in the game  
I could see her in the distance  
But I could not lay my claim  
Let me tell you 'bout this cherry  
I never got a single bite  
Therefore I imagine we'll be doing it  
Tonight
