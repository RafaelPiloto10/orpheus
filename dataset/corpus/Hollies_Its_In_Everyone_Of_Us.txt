It's in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by  
  
It's in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by  
  
It's in everyone of us  
I just remembered  
It's like I've been sleepin' forty years  
I'm not awake as I can be  
But my seein's better  
I can see, through the tears  
I've been realisin' bad  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show  
But there is scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands  
You all know (you all know) what I know (what I know)  
And it's good  
That it's so  
  
It's in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by and  
  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by
