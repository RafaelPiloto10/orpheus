Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky  
And we'll stir the stars around and watch them fall away  
Into the Hudson Bay and plummet out of sight and sound  
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills  
Where I live in the Alpine heights  
Below the northern lights I spend my coldest nights alone awake  
And thinking of the weekend we were in love  
(The weekend we were in love)  
Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull  
A thousand miles from the tide  
Put photos on the walls of New York shopping malls  
Distract me so I stay inside  
I wish the rocket stayed over the promenade 'cause I would make a hook  
And I can fish them from the sky  
My darling she and I, we're hanging on so take us high  
To sing the world goodbye  
I am floating away lost in a silent ballet  
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you  
Awake to take in the view  
Late nights and early parades  
Still photos and noisy arcades  
My darling we're both on the wing  
Look down and keep on singing and we can go anywhere  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head  
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone  
I am floating away  
(Floating away)  
Lost in a silent ballet  
(Silent ballet)  
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you  
Awake to take in the view  
Late nights and early parades  
(Early parades)  
Still photos and noisy arcades  
(Noisy arcades)  
My darling we're both on the wing look down and keep on singing  
And we can go anywhere  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)
