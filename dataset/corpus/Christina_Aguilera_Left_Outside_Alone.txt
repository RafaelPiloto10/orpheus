All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been livin in a fantasy without meaning  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
  
I Don't Feel Safe Oohhh  
  
Left broken empty in despair  
Wanna breathe can't find air  
Thought you were sent from up above  
But you and me never had love  
So much more I have to say  
Help me find a way  
  
And I wonder if you know  
How it really feels  
To be left outside alone  
When it's cold out here  
Well maybe you should know  
Just how it feels  
To be left outside alone  
To be left outside alone  
  
I'll tell you  
All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been living in a fantasy without meaning  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
I need to pray  
  
Why do you play me like a game?  
Always someone else to blame  
Careless, helpless little man  
Someday you might understand  
There's not much more to say  
But I hope you find a way  
  
Still I wonder if you know  
How it really feels  
To be left outside alone  
When it's cold out here  
Well maybe you should know  
Just how it feels  
To be left outside alone  
To be left outside alone  
  
I'll tell you  
All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been living in a fantasy without meaning  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
I need to pray  
  
Oohhh ohhh Pray!  
  
Heavenly father please save me (heavenly fathers Save me!)  
  
Oohhh oohhhh ohh  
  
And I wonder if you know  
How it really feels  
To be left outside alone  
When it's cold out here  
Well maybe you should know  
Just how it feels  
To be left outside alone  
To be left outside alone  
  
Oohhhhh ohhhh  
  
All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been living in a fantasy without meaning Oh!  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
I need toooo praayy!
