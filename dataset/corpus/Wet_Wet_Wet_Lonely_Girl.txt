Hey lonely girl, what are you looking for  
You lost your thrill, and you can't hide it  
Knew it from the start  
Your world could fall apart  
Didn't wanna know,  
So love just came and went the other way  
Like the times we had before  
You don't want them anymore  
  
And think of the times we had before  
Now my worlds turned upside down  
Having the love to give and no-one seems to care  
  
I won't give you up  
I'll never give you up  
Even when it hurts inside, baby  
I won't give you up  
I'll never live it down  
Come back and stay  
  
Hey lonely girl, yeah, come be in my picture, alone  
Be my dark and heavy skies  
Be my love and be my life  
  
And think of the times we had before  
Now my worlds turned upside down  
Having the love to give and no-one seems to care  
  
I won't give you up  
I'll never give you up  
Even when it hurts inside, baby  
I won't give you up  
I'll never live it down  
Come back and stay  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
And think of the times we had before  
(now my world's turned upside down)  
  
Now my worlds turned upside down  
Having the love to give and no-one seems to care  
Now, now, now  
  
I won't give you up  
I'll never give you up  
Even when it hurts inside, baby  
I won't give you up  
I'll never live it down  
Come back and stay  
  
I won't give you up  
I'll never give you up  
Even when it hurts inside, baby  
I won't give you up  
I'll never live it down  
Come back and stay  
Yeah
