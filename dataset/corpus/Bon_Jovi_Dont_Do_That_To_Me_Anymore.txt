If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times  
You can't go on playing with people's minds  
But you lied thinking that you'd get by  
Breaking hearts one by one in a line  
Cause you're driving me crazy  
I just can't go on making love to a woman  
Who's been playing with me all along  
So don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
I can count the times you really made me a fool  
I guess what we've got was a different set of rules  
Well you cried, thinking that I'd breakdown  
But I'm not sure I need you hanging around  
Cause you're driving me crazy  
I just can't go on making love to a woman  
Who's been playing with me all along  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
You wont have me to kick around anymore  
I'm not a fool for you and that's for sure  
No reason left for you to try to pretend  
I told you before now I'll say it again  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore
