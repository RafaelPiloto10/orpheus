There's me then there's you  
And I could dance with the puck  
In a telephone booth  
You said, I don't give a fuck  
Besides enough about you  
And your, 'Evil's Banal'  
'Cause as soon as Joni says, "Blue"  
You're somewhere else, somewhere else  
There's me then there's you  
And I could not hear it yet  
From a telephone booth  
I do my hungover best  
And say, enough about you  
And your representative hell  
I jump in when you do  
Like there's nowhere else  
And then of course there's the dorsal fin  
Closing in that you cannot outswim  
It's not him that I gotta outswim you said  
Just you, you said, just you  
And there's the heart of the melt  
There's the narrowest flume  
There's the somewhere else  
When I'm with you  
There's nowhere else  
There's me then there's you  
There's me then there's you  
You could not say enough  
If there were several you's  
That would not be enough  
There's me then there's you  
You're a beautiful you  
A beautiful you, a beautiful you  
You could not say enough  
If there were several you's  
It would not be enough  
We're a beautiful two
