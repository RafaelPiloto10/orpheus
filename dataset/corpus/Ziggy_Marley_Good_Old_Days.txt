Irie days come on play  
Let the angels fly let the devils die  
Got to do what you can with the time at hand  
Ali boom mah yeah Ali boom mah yeah  
Don't worry your mind its just the test of time  
In five years these be the good old days  
  
No one knows what the future holds for everything has a season  
Its not a time for war its a time for peace  
Tomorrow knows tomorrow woes  
I remember when grandpa use to say grandson these be the good old days  
  
These be the good old days  
  
Now comes the moon with its starry lights  
And so begins the night life  
The tribal dance puts me in a trance  
As she pulls me in with her magic swing  
I asked of her what do we celebrate  
She said to me these be the good old days  
  
These be the good old days  
  
There is no future there is only now  
Let's cherish these moments that we now know  
  
These be the good old days
