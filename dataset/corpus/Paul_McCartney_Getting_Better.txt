It's getting better all the time  
I used to get mad at my school, the teachers that taught me weren't cool  
You're holding me down, turning me round  
I'm filling me up with your rules  
  
[Chorus]  
I've got to admit, it's getting better, A little better all the time  
(It can't get no worse)  
I have to admit, it's getting better  
It's getting better, since you've been mine  
  
Me used to be angry young man, Me hiding me head in the sand  
You gave me the word, I finally heard  
I'm doing the best that I can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Getting so much better all the time, it's getting better all the time  
Better, better, better, It's getting better all the time  
Better, better, better  
  
I use to be cruel to my woman  
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she love  
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene  
And I'm doing the best that I can  
  
[Chorus]
