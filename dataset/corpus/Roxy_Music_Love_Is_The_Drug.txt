T'ain't no big thing  
To wait for the bell to ring  
T'ain't no big thing  
The toll of the bell  
Aggravated, spare for days  
  
I troll downtown the red light place  
Jump up bubble up, what's in store  
Love is the drug and I need to score  
Showing out, showing out, hit and run  
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on  
Stitched up tight, can't shake free  
Love is the drug, got a hook on me  
  
Oh oh catch that buzz  
Love is the drug I'm thinking of  
Oh oh can't you see  
Love is the drug for me  
Late that night I park my car  
Stake my place in the singles bar  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Heart to heart as we hit the floor  
Lumber up, limbo down  
  
The locked embrace, the stumble round  
I say go, she say yes  
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest  
Oh oh catch that buzz  
Love is the drug I'm thinking of  
Oh oh can't you see  
Love is the drug, got a hook in me  
Oh oh catch that buzz  
Love is the drug I'm thinking of  
Oh oh can't you see  
Love is the drug for me
