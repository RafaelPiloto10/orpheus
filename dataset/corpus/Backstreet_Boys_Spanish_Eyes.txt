Here we are in the arms of one another  
And we still go on searching for each other  
Knowing that hate is wrong and love is  
right for us tonight  
  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
I know the reason why I am alive  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a place I've never been  
And it comes from deep within  
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize  
Knowing all I have to do  
Is reach out my hand to you  
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes  
  
Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers  
Who believe that we see no wall between us  
How can they be in my heart and in my mind,  
when all I could find  
  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
I know the reason why I am alive  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I loved you from a distance  
Thought I couldn't reach that far  
I can't believe how close that we are  
When I look into your Spanish eyes  
And the world is so beautiful tonight  
  
[Chorus]
