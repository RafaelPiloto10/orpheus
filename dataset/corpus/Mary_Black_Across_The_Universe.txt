Words are flying out like endless rain into a paper cup,  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe  
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,  
Possessing and caressing me.  
Jai guru de va om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,  
That call me on and on across the universe,  
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they  
Tumble blindly as they make their way  
Across the universe  
Jai guru de va om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Sounds of laughter shades of love are ringing  
Through my open ears [views] inciting and inviting me  
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a  
Million suns, it calls me on and on  
Across the universe  
Jai guru de va om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Jai - live forever  
Guru - teacher  
De va - heavenly one  
Om - the vibration of the universe
