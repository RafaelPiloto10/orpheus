Keeping walking these streets so long singin' the same old song  
He knows every crack on those dirty sidewalks of Broadway  
Where hustle's the name of the game  
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain  
There's been a load of compromising on the road to his horizon  
But he's gonna be where the lights are shining on him  
Like a Rhinestone Cowboy riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
Like a Rhinestone Cowboy getting cards and letter from people he don't even
know  
And offers coming over the phone  
  
He really don't mind the rain and a smile can hide all the pain  
But you're down when you're riding the train that's taking the long way  
And he dreams of the things he'll do  
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside his shoe  
There'll be a load of compromising  
Like a Rhinestone Cowboy
