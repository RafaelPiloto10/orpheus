Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
Surely you can take some comfort knowing that you're mine  
Just hold me tight, lay by my side  
And let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
  
I found my place in the world  
Could stare at your face for the rest of my days  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I can breathe  
Turn my insides out and smother me  
Warm and alive, I'm all over you  
Would you smother me?  
  
Let me be the one who never leaves you all alone  
I hold my breath and lose the feeling that I'm on my own  
Hold me too tight, stay by my side  
And let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
  
I found my place in the world  
Could stare at your face for the rest of my days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Smother me  
Smother me  
  
When I'm alone, time goes so slow  
I need you here with me  
And how my mistakes have made  
Your heart break  
Still I need you here with me  
So, baby, I'm... baby, I'm here  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Smother me  
Smother me  
  
Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time  
Let me be the one who calls you baby, the one who calls you baby
