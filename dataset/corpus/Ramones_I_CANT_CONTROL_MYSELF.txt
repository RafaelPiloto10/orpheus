I can't stand still cause you've got me goin'  
Your slacks are low and your hips are showin'  
I take you girl as you're standin' there  
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair  
Don't want you goin' round with no one else  
Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself  
  
Defenses down and you got me shakin'  
You got me so that my nerves are breakin'  
If you knew me like I know you girl  
Your knees would bend and your hair would curl  
You make me move yea like no one else  
Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself  
  
I've got this feeling that's inside of me  
It makes me think of how things used to be  
It makes me feel alright  
When I'm with you at night and we love  
And we love  
  
You thrill me so with this big temptation  
This kind of feelin' could move a nation  
And I'm okay when I'm here with you  
I do the things that you want me to  
I do these things for no one else 'cause when I'm with you I can't control
myself  
  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself  
I can't control myself, baby
