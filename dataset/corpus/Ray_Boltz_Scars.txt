Scars  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I heard Him call my name  
He said I've come to save you  
But I was so ashamed  
I turned to walk away  
He reached out His hand  
And said I have something to show you  
And what I saw changed my life that day  
  
I saw His scars  
No He didn't try to hide them  
He said, Come and look inside them  
They are a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
I knew it must be true  
I saw His scars  
  
I said Lord my scars are deep  
And I don't want You to see them  
So many of them were caused  
By things I chose to do  
He said, Look again  
At the ones that I am wearing  
Don't you know I chose these scars too?  
  
I saw His scars  
No He didn't try to hide them  
He said, Come and look inside them  
They are a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
I knew it must be true  
I saw His scars  
  
And one day in Heaven  
When we are on our knees  
We'll look up at Jesus  
And I believe we'll see  
We'll see His scars  
No, He will not try to hide them  
He'll say, Come and look inside them  
They're a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
And we'll know that it's true  
We'll see His scars  
We'll see His scars  
No He will not try to hide them  
He'll say, Come and look inside them  
They're a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
Oh we'll know that it's true  
Because He died for me and you  
Oh we'll know that it's true  
We'll see His scars
