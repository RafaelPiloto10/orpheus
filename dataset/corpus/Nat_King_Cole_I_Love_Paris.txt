Nat king cole  
(cole porter)  
("can-can")  
  
Every time I look down on this timeless town  
Whether blue or gray be her skies.  
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,  
More and more do I realize:  
  
I love paris in the springtime.  
I love paris in the fall.  
I love paris in the winter when it drizzles,  
I love paris in the summer when it sizzles.  
  
I love paris every moment,  
Every moment of the year.  
I love paris, why, oh why do I love paris?  
Because my love is near.
