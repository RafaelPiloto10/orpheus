Every day of the week with a different hoe (every day I want a different hoe)  
Getting paid that cash from zero (I came from zero)  
And my bands on full with blue C-notes  
  
Salute all my niggas from Lakewood to the motherfuckin Pinkstokes

And fd still watchin, Rolex the watches  
Money in the ceiling, money in the couch  
Countin up more than I can
