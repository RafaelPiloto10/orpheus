I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling , I was lost in your love  
  
There's been a diff'rence of opinion to the way I've been treating you  
But you know that I've tried to apologize,  
for all the bad times I've put you through  
On the chance that I could make you mine  
There's not a thing I would not do  
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love  
  
I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling , I was lost in your love  
  
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies  
Through endless skies I will go  
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know  
That when I get you here inside my arms  
I never ever ever will let you go  
And wrong or right I'll be with you and lost in your love  
  
I was lost in your love  
I was held by your heart  
And no secrets stood between us anymore  
I'm like a child learning pain  
I was held by your chains  
And my darling I was lost in your love
