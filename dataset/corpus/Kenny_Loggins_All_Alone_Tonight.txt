Day is done and night is calling  
From the window light is falling  
Shadows spinning on the walls  
And dancing in the light  
And 'round the door the kids are playing  
Like June bugs into the light  
And it seems like I'm looking at a mighty good time  
All alone tonight  
Hands a-clapping, voices singing  
Tambourines and guitars ringing  
Echoes through the willows  
Bringing music to the night  
And in the wind the whippoorwill's crying  
Cold and all alone  
And I am standing outside of a mighty good time  
All alone tonight  
Well, I can't recall when Louisiana music  
Ever sounded so sweet  
Just listen to the fiddle playing  
'Bonaparte's Retreat'  
Well, I just can't take no more  
I gotta make it through that door  
And dance until the break of day  
As long as there's still music playing  
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight  
Well, I just can't take no more  
I gotta make it through that door  
And dance until the break of day  
As long as there's still music playing  
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight
