Jimmy, my heart is full of love, only true love  
And its wisdom and visions are you  
(Baby baby, it's no returning)  
Jimmy, there's words unspoken, and unbroken  
Only you can ensure everlasting  
(Baby baby, this love is you)  
Jimmy, I would like to drive your car  
It don't matter how long, how far  
Jimmy, you can have my loving heart and key and all  
Jimmy, I would like to wear your ring  
All your love songs I sure will sing  
Jimmy, you can have my loving heart and key and all  
Jimmy, I don't need to tell you how good your love is  
You're really all I need  
Jimmy, my heart is full of love, only true love  
And its wisdom and visions are you  
(Baby baby, it's no returning)  
Jimmy, there's words unspoken, and unbroken  
Only you can ensure everlasting  
(Baby baby, this love is you)  
Jimmy, I would like to drive your car  
It don't matter how long, how far  
Jimmy, you can have my loving heart and key and all  
Jimmy, I would like to wear your ring  
All your love songs I sure will sing  
Jimmy, you can have my loving heart and key and all
