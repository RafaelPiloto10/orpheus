Jason: D.C. 930. How many people from Virginia in here tonight?  
Very cool, very cool. I grew up in Virginia.  
This is the closest Ive ever played to home, so  
This is very very groovy. Lets see what happens.  
  
Strange because I believe it is my future  
Staring back at me  
With eyes so light  
I never dreamed it could be  
Anything else than what they could see  
Oh, they are colors  
That collide and scope  
My heart belongs into  
Magnificent ever-changing patterns do  
Im wide awake at the wheel  
Its oh so crazy because I can see  
It could be my presence  
So pleasantly deprived  
Ive never seen the explained prophecies  
Or anything else it should be  
Oh they are troubled  
And disguised behind wise eyes and wise crackin smiles  
Hypnotized behind a panel  
On a thirty hour drive  
Im not at all what I seem  
But my intentions are practical inventions  
Forgot to mention Im insane by definition  
Were taking pictures on the paper  
No escape, the morning after I outride the wave  
  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Said, all in all, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely well succeed  
All in all, I said, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Ive developed a lovely distaste for your heart on my sleeve, yeah  
(scatting)  
  
We keep it simple  
Keep it clean  
Keep repeating the words as often as you need  
Oh, think, think  
Blinks like a turning signal me to  
Turn, turn away oh  
From anything good, people say  
Oh now, I will be selective, calm, cool and collective  
And listening to the voice and it's perspective  
Hoping that the choices, appropriately respected  
Are protecting me, are protecting me  
Hey, hey, protecting me, protecting me  
And I would like a little sugar in my coffee  
I would like a little dream  
And I'd prefer another smoke before the morning  
Or anything else in between  
  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Said, all in all, it's unlikely  
All in all, it's unlikely well succeed  
All in all, I said, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Ive developed a lovely distaste for your wide open spaces  
I sense a delay  
Oh, brushing my mind and scrubbing behind all the places I feel there's decay  
Of information  
Away, I say run, boy  
(scatting)  
  
Oh, oh we keep it  
So wicked and it's wild  
Your past, your former style  
Oh they can make believe in  
Knowing why you're leaving  
Youre just wanting to be on your own  
I said, you're wanting to be on your own  
Yeah, you wanted to be on your own  
I said, you're wanting to be on your own
