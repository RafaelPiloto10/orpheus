Flyin' me back to Memphis  
Gotta find my Daisy Jane  
Well the summer's gonne  
And I hope she's feelin' the same  
Well I left her just to roam the city  
Thinkin' it would easy the pain  
I'm a crazy man and I'm playin' my crazy game, game  
Does she really love me I think she does  
Like the star above me I know  
Because when the sky is bright  
Everything's all right  
  
Flyin' me back to Memphis  
Honey keep the oven warm  
All the clouds are clearin'  
And I think we're over the storm  
Well I been pickin' it up around me  
Daisy I think I'm sane  
Well I'm awful glad  
And I guess you're really to blame, blame  
Do you really love me  
I hope you do  
Like the stars above me how I love you  
When it's cold at night  
Everything's all right
