Hear me, speaking  
Asking why I even bother  
Tell me, how you  
Live from day to day  
  
Take your time and look around  
Is this utopia you've found  
  
Sick of all of this  
The suffering and we just carry on  
Isn't it time we care and lose the hate  
Understand our fears  
  
But we do all that we can  
Justify the means to an end  
Sorry you must excuse me  
I've painted my own Mona Lisa  
She's fixed everything  
Now I'm spoiled beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Blind faith we have in you  
Invisible  
Which direction do we choose  
Predictable  
  
Take the streets, the beaten path  
Our system works for whom I ask  
Yeah I have it all  
The bigger house  
An iron fence to keep you out  
  
When did we all let you down  
So come Messiah show us how how  
Our human spirit drowns  
Don't think you hear me now  
No sign of you around  
What is it you hope to see  
  
Blind faith we have in you  
Invisible  
Which direction do we choose  
Predictable  
Give us something we can use  
Desirable  
Cause you've done all you can do  
Regrettable  
  
And still life pushes on  
With or without you  
We've got to carry on  
Our will, will guide us to  
A place where we belong  
Know there lies the truth  
I am the believer who gives purpose on to you  
  
I don't think we let you down  
So come Messiah show us how how  
Throw us a pure lifeline  
I hope that you hear me  
Too proud to be around  
There's more to us than we see now  
  
Blind faith we have in you  
Invisible  
Which direction do we choose  
Predictable  
Self ignorance, abuse  
Desirable  
Cause you've done all you can do  
Incredible
