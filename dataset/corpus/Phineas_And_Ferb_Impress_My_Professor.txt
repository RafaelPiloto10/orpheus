Back in class, Evil 101...  
I always had so much fun...  
Though the one who advised me...  
Openly despised me...  
Still I always tried to be number one  
  
Well I wanted a mentor to share my world view  
But I got a tormentor, I was hated, it's true  
Now I have one more chance, and it could mean my advancement  
So there's only one thing I must do:  
  
I must impress my professor  
(He's got to be good)  
I must impress my professor  
(He's misunderstood)  
He needs validation for his evil creation  
  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Like any good evil scientist would  
  
I must impress my professor to be a success  
  
(He must impress his professor to be a success! )  
  
Or I will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey  
  
(Or he will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey)  
  
In the eyes of this person  
Whose opinion may worsen  
If my evil invention's not great  
  
I must impress my professor!  
(Impress his professor)  
I must impress my professor!  
(Impress his professor)  
I must impress my professor  
Before it's too late!
