Storms never last, do they, baby?  
Bad times, all pass with the wind  
Your hand in mine, steal the thunder  
You make the sun wanna shine  
  
I followed you down each and every road, babe  
I picked wild flower, sung you soft, sad song  
And every road we took, I know, your search was for the truth  
And this storm that's brewin' now won't last long  
  
Storms never last, do they, baby?  
Bad times, all pass with the wind  
Your hand in mine steal the thunder  
You make the sun wanna shine  
  
Storms never last, do they, baby?  
Bad times, all pass with the wind  
Your hand in mine steal the thunder  
You make the sun wanna shine  
You said you make the sun wanna shine
