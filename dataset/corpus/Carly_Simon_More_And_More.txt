I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than just a melody  
To let you know that I love you  
  
I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than just a song to sing  
To let you know that it's the real thing  
  
I want to make us be  
You and me  
In close harmony  
I want to make us be  
You and me  
In close harmony  
  
Serenades and symphonies  
Lullabyes and sweet melodies  
We'll make romantic rhapsodies  
Music, maestro, if you please  
  
I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than just a love affair  
Cause, darlin', you can find that anywhere  
  
lay your head upon my breast  
Fondle me with your tenderness  
We've got the key to happiness  
Close your eyes and I'll do the rest  
  
I want to give you more  
More and more  
More and more  
More than even life itself  
I wouldn't settle for nothing else
