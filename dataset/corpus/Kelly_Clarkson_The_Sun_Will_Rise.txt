I can see the wait there in your eyes  
I can feel the thought in your sigh  
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing flight  
One way down a dead end street  
Broken glass underneath your feet  
You think the day won't break the sunless night  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
When you've lost your lights  
The sun will rise  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright  
  
I've been in stuck in a storm before  
Felt the wind raging at my door  
Couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't find a way out  
Somehow my clouds disappeared  
Somehow I made it here  
Maybe just so you could hear me say  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise (the sun will rise)  
When you've lost your lights  
The sun will rise  
It'll be alright (it'll be alright)  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright  
  
Although you can't see it  
So hard to believe it  
Sometimes you just need a little faith (all you need is a little faith)  
There's an answer to your prayer  
And I swear that there'll come a day, yeah  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise (the sun will rise)  
The sun will rise (the sun will rise)  
The sun will rise  
Yeah  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
  
It'll be alright  
It'll be alright (yeah yeah)  
It'll be alright (yeah yeah)  
It'll be alright (yeah yeah)  
It'll be alright  
  
The sun will rise
