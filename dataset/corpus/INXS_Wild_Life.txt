Take one step  
Out the door  
Look around  
For a whole lot more  
  
Off in the distance  
Fire burn bright  
We make decisions  
That's what we do  
That's what we do  
  
Wild life  
Wild life  
When it's bad it ain't bad enough  
  
I'll be your one  
Your one and only  
Like animals  
Locked in the zoo  
  
Give me freedom  
Day and night  
No one to tell me  
What to do  
  
Off in the distance  
Fire burn bright  
We make decisions  
  
Wild life  
Wild life  
When it's bad it ain't bad enough  
  
I got to learn  
Some respect  
That's what I have  
I have for you  
  
Motivation  
It comes and goes  
But the questions  
They stay alive  
  
Wild life  
Wild life  
When it's bad it ain't bad enough
