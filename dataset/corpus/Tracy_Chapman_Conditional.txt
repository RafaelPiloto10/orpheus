It's conditional  
Not for free  
There are strings attached  
Tied to me  
I'll want something back  
If you agree  
To be in love with me  
  
Hold me hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your memory  
Perfect perfect in your gaze  
Far as my eye can see  
  
It's conditional  
Not for free  
There are strings attached  
Tied to me  
I'll want something back  
If you agree  
To be in love with me  
  
Try to try to try to forget  
To change the things about me  
You can not accept  
Any day that you have regret  
Just let it recede  
  
It's conditional  
Not for free  
There are strings attached  
Tied to me  
I'll want something back  
If you agree  
To be in love with me  
  
There are vows that must be made  
There are terms that can't expire  
There are words that must be said  
And there are qualifiers  
I'll love you but I'll count the ways  
The things that I admire  
And anyone who says they won't  
You can call a liar  
  
It's conditional  
Not for free  
There are strings attached  
Tied to me  
I'll want something back  
If you agree  
To be in love with me  
  
Stay with me stay with me  
Right or wrong  
Pledge your loyalty  
Have faith have faith  
That we do belong  
Together for eternity  
  
It's conditional  
Not for free  
There are strings attached  
Tied to me  
I'll want something back  
If you agree  
To be in love with me
