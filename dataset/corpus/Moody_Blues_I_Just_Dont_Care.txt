The indestructible has broken down,  
The undeniable is turned around  
And I don't care, my love,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
The unbelievable has all come true,  
I love the changes that you've put me through  
And I don't care, you see,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
  
I see the magic  
That we're making now  
And a veil is lifted  
From my eyes, somehow,  
And the most amazing thing  
That comes to light  
Is the world looks different  
To me overnight.  
  
My friends will tell you  
That I've lost my cool,  
The lovesick schoolboy  
Turning up for school  
But I don't care, you know,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.

'cause I don't care, you see,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
I love you
