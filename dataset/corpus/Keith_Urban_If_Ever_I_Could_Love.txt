I used to cry out in the middle of the night  
Baby hold me tight  
But there was no one beside me when I opened my eyes  
Now I turn the corner of those days and nights  
Something inside me changed and I think I might  
Be starting over  
I don't wanna run  
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
If ever thought I found somebody so true  
I wonder if you feel  
The same way that I do  
If ever I could love  
I think it could be with you  
  
You know I can't read your mind love  
But it seems to me  
That your heart and mine tonight are  
Defying gravity  
There's something so familiar  
And still so unknown  
The closer we get I swear it feels like coming home  
And I'm ready to be brave  
Oh yea and you look at me say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could love  
If ever I could be  
If ever I could love  
Oh yeah no way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was scared to love again  
Till the day that came  
When she walked out of my life  
I got hurt so bad  
I swear I'd never let another inside this heart of mine  
But you touch my hand and every plan that I had  
Disappeared like a fallen star  
There's a new beginning and I'm moving to the rhythm  
Of a beating braver heart  
A braver heart  
If ever I could love, oh oh  
If ever I could love, yea yea
