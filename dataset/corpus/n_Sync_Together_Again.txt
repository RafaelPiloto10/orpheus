How can I say that I love you  
When you're so far away  
So tell me why you had to go  
Was it me, I need to know  
  
What can I do to make you see  
That I'm here, here for you  
I really hope that you'll come home  
So we can be together again  
  
What can I do (What can I do)  
To make you see (To make you see)  
That I'm here (I'm here)  
Here for you (I'm here for you)  
I really hope (I really hope)  
That you'll come home (That you'll come home)  
So we can be (So we can be)  
Together again (Together again)  
  
Ooh...together again  
Ooh...together again
