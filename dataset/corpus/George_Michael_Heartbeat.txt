Another summer, another vacation is over  
A september morning with the sun and smell of the clover  
Down by the gates we sit and watch all our friends go by  
And pretend we don't hear the bell that rings through the  
Summer sky  
  
I was happy with the kisses she gave me  
It's just that happy was she made me  
Happy that was until I saw you  
  
Chorus:  
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you fail me now?  
You hurt me, desert me in my darkest hour  
Heartbeat, heartbeat, why do you keep me here?  
How could I help but admire her beauty  
Standing on the line between desire and duty  
Heartbeat, heartbeat, it will end in tears  
  
I need a lover that loves such a dangerous place to be  
Oh, if we were meant for each other then why don't you answer me  
Don't keep me waiting, you know that I long to be by your side  
  
I was happy with the kisses she gave me  
Now there's nothing on earth that can save me  
Why should I care I can have you?  
  
Chorus to fade
