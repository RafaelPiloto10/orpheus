It's just a look, and it makes the boys quiver.  
Yes, it's just the look, and now they remember.  
Had they forgotten ... what this all means?  
I think they want to forget,  
And they hope that this time.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I won't look, I've got other things to do now.  
I forgot what it was, I've got to get to work now.  
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!).  
It can happen to me too.  
(And it) didn't make any difference to us (But I)  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
With our love,  
With our love,  
With our love  
They hear the words, such as "You're really special"  
(And they) can't face the feeling.  
(And they) can't really tell  
I look out the window,  
(And I) I call that education.  
(And I) See all my friends standing out there  
(And I) I call that education (sophistication)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Had the forgotten...what this all means?  
Things come and go (and I see 'em)  
And I won't be neglected (not this time!)
