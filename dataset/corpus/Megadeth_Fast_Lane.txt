You don't know what I feel, I get behind the wheel  
A fuel in my soul  
I hyperventilate as I accelerate  
Till I've lost all control  
  
My speed becomes relentless  
And testing all my senses  
White line appearing faster  
Prompting death and disaster  
  
My supersonic machine  
Get out of my  
  
Fast lane, like a jet plane  
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane  
Addicted to the fast lane  
Rushing to my brain  
No time to explain, this is my domain  
Addicted to the fast lane  
  
I look into mirror, red lights are drawing nearer  
They think I've met my match  
But I shift into high gear, soon they just disappear  
You can't jail what you can't catch  
  
My speed becomes relentless  
And testing all my senses  
White line appearing faster  
Prompting death and d-d-disaster  
  
I hear the engines screaming  
I'm burning up the  
  
Fast lane, like a jet plane  
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane  
Addicted to the fast lane  
Rushing to my brain  
No time to explain, this is my domain  
Fast lane  
  
Fast lane, like a jet plane  
Like a freight train, this is my domain  
D-d-domain
