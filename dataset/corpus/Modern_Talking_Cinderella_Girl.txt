Oh I saw her near ocean avenue  
Wears a t-shirt and her eyes are blue  
She told me that  
She's living in the heart of L.A. City now, mmm  
We went straight to a night cafe  
Took popcorn, coffee, and I heard her say  
She told me that  
She's living in the heart of L.A. City now, mmm  
  
Cinderella girl - you're in my mind  
A girl like you - is so hard to find  
Cinderella girl - I'll miss you so  
Oh I'll never let you go, oh no  
  
It was late at night, in that night cafe  
She's eating ice cream, when I heard her say  
Please pick me up  
Tomorrow in the heart of L.A. City now, mmm  
At four o'clock, she took a cap  
I saw her waving, never saw her back  
She told me that  
She's living in the heart of L.A. City now, mmm
