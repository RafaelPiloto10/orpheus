Are You Ready  
  
Are you ready? You can trust me all the way.  
Are you ready? Well, then let me hear you say  
That you're ready, and the world will know it's right.  
Yes, you're ready, and I know it's out of sight.  
  
Now you're ready, well, then what you waitin' for?  
If you're ready, you just open up your door  
'Cause I'm ready, for everything you got.  
Yes, I'm ready, come and get it while it's hot.
