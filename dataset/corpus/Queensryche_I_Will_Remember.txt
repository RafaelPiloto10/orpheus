There's a cold wind out tonight  
The chill of distant eyes  
An orbit survey finds... your mind  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight...  
  
There's a thought that fills your mind  
A vision of time  
When knowledge was confined  
And then we wonder how machines  
Can steal each other's dreams  
From points that are unseen... It's real  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight  
  
Oh can't you see the light  
Of the knowing star  
  
When you gaze at the evening sky  
And you're reaching out with your mind  
You might see the nation's eyes  
Don't hide... It's you  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight
