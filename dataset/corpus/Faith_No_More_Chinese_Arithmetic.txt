Candle light, it burns in every hole of your eyes  
It's beautiful, how much you'll never realize  
So hush my love, there's something I'm to tell you now  
Your time has come, around again my sleepless one  
Your friend was young, hung and plastered  
He never knew his own disaster  
I think it's good, in fact it was faster  
Cause it was you that he was after  
Hold me now, as if you'll never let me go  
Unhand me now, as if you've always known my name  
His love was king, his love was master  
He needed more, he needed always  
He searched in vein for love and shelter  
In every soul, in every hallway  
So you thought she'd be sweeter than your girlfriend Peter  
Well give it a second chance cause you've yet to meet her  
We got the same ideas, we got the same old fears  
They're different colors sometimes, but, hey, who cares?  
Just years that tears our lives apart  
Just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk  
He couldn't do it-push!-you told him twice  
Well, I do man but it just don't jive  
Tried so hard to control my behavior  
I tried so hard, so hard to believe you  
But now I live only to deceive you  
So KICK and SCREAM!!!
