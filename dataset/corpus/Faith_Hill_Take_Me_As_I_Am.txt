Baby, don't turn out the light  
I want to see you look at me  
Whisper only truth tonight  
Not just promises and empty fantasies  
  
I don't need a bed of roses  
'Cause roses wither away  
All I really need is honesty  
From someone with a strong heart  
A gentle hand  
Who'll take me as I am  
  
Baby, I need for you to know  
Just exactly how I feel  
Fiery passions come and go  
I'd trade a million pretty words  
For one touch that is real  
  
I don't need a bed of roses  
'Cause roses wither away  
All I really need is honesty  
From someone with a strong heart  
A gentle hand  
Who'll take me as I am  
  
From someone with a strong heart  
A gentle hand  
Who'll take me as I am
