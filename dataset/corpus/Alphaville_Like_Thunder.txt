If I was a flag I'd have no nation  
Just the colours and the wind  
And if I was a church I'd have no treasure  
Except the prayers and the hyms  
And if I was a seagull I'd just rise up  
And carry my soul across the sea  
Drifting beyond the horizon  
Lost by the ground to be free  
If I was a life-boat I'd be waiting all my life  
For another stormy day  
And if I was a dolphin I'd be playing all the time  
Just playing my life away  
And if I was a kite I'd just be laughing  
And dragging you up to the sky  
Setting you down on a white cloud  
While a seagull's floating by  
And the silence roars like thunder
