There's a reason for the life that you live  
And there's pleasin' that I know you can give  
And I been crayin' the love you been sayin'  
So baby won't you give it to me  
  
You're tellin' me no, no, no  
You don't want to let your love go  
I'm tellin' you yes, yes, yes  
You really oughta be gettin' some happiness  
  
I made a motion and it's out on the floor  
And it's a notion that I'd love to explore  
Cause I been tastin' the love you been wastin'  
So baby won't you give it to me  
  
You're a lady  
And I'm here in the palm of your hand  
Such a lady  
How much more do you think I can stand?
