What Child is this  
Who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping?  
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet,  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
  
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,  
Come Peasant, King to own Him  
The King of Kings salvation brings,  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.  
  
Oh, raise, raise a song on high,  
His mother sings her lullaby.  
Joy, oh joy for Christ is born,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing  
  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe,  
The Son,  
Of Mary.  
  
What Child  
Is this  
Who laid  
To rest  
On Mary's lap  
On Mary's lap  
He is sleeping  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe,  
The Son,  
Of Mary  
  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
The Son of Mary
