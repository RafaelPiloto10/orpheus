Singing carols, stringing popcorn  
Making footprints in the snow  
Memories, Christmas memories  
They're the sweetest ones I know  
Cookies baking in the kitchen  
Cards and ribbons everywhere  
Frosty, Christmas memories  
Float like snowflakes in the air  
And oh, the joy of waking Christmas mornings  
The family round the tree  
We had a way of making Christmas morning  
As merry as can be  
I close my eyes and see shining faces  
Of all the children who now have children of their own  
Funny, but comes December  
And I remember every Christmas I've known
