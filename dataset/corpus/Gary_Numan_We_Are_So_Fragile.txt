We are so fragile  
Advertising lies  
That are whiter than yours  
We are so fragile  
They could give us a war  
Just to keep us amused  
  
We are so fragile  
I could stay here inside  
And say 'It's all been done'  
We are so fragile  
Just pretend I never tried  
I'll leave up to you  
  
We are still so young  
And it must be wrong  
But I'll do it all the same  
We are really so shy  
There's nothing I can do  
Except believe in you  
  
We could always go home  
But everyone says  
This is the place to be  
We are so unnatural  
But you wouldn't understand  
You only deal with men
