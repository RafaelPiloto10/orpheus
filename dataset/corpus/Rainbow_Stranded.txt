Dog night I'm so alone  
A million miles out on my own  
No one to talk no one to care  
Searching for someone they could be anywhere  
Magic and madness it's so very strange  
Soemtimes I think it's all pre-arranged  
That same old feeling hits me again  
Just the beginning but its feels like the end  
Oh feel like I'm stranded out here  
Oh I think I might disappear  
No don't leave me stranded out here  
Oh it's just the loneliness I fear  
  
Lonely window fading star  
You never felt so near yet so far  
Tried to forget you the best that I could  
Don't try to find me it won't do any good  
I'm caught in a dream so hard to locate  
I'm just a captive of my own fate  
No turning back no not tonight  
You're moving on way out of sight  
Oh feel like I'm stranded out here  
Oh I think I might disappear  
No don't leave me stranded out here  
Oh it's just the loneliness I fear  
Stranded (8 times)  
Oh I feel like I'm stranded out here  
Same as before  
Stranded...
