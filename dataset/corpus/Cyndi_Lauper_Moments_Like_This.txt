Moments like this don't last long  
I lock them safe away  
What good is it to say  
I'll get along  
Just like before  
And I won't care  
I won't care anymore  
You called my name  
The music played  
And I'm not sure of myself anymore  
  
I'm not so sure  
  
Say you gotta know just what you're doin'  
And don't you say that I could just be an illusion  
And that's ok its alright baby you the feel  
Love oh baby  
  
After this night is through  
After I'm wondering it it's you  
  
Oh  
  
I'll get along  
Just like before  
And I don't care  
I won't care anymore  
You called my name  
The music played  
And I'm not sure of myself anymore  
I'm not so sure  
  
Say you gotta know just what you're doin'  
Don't you say that I could just be an illusion  
And that's ok its alright maybe I'm the fool  
Love oh baby  
  
After this night is through  
After I'm wondering it it's you  
  
I'll get along  
Just like before  
Just like before
