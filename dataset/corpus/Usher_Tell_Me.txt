[Intro]  
I just wanna  
I just wanna take my time, my time, my time with you  
Oooh, oooh  
  
[Verse 1]  
We're here alone while the thunder is roaring  
And the windows are blowing  
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight  
I put my hand on your chest  
I can feel your heart  
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine  
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes  
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said  
I need you so much  
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh  
Oooh, oooh  
(I need you)  
[Bridge]  
I want to hold you till I can't feel again  
Until your soul lets me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is  
  
[Verse 2]  
We're going to a whole 'nother level  
When we do it, it's so true  
And it's so much more than sexual tonight  
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected  
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for  
It gets better and better with time  
This is deeper than love  
The more of you I have the more of you I want  
Oooh, oooh  
(Oh, I need you, baby)  
Oooh, oooh  
(Woah)  
  
[Bridge]  
I want to hold you till I can't feel again  
Until your soul lets me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve the love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Oooh, oooh  
Hey, hey  
Oh baby, can we go deeper?  
Deeper than the surface  
Further than that  
  
[Bridge]  
I want to hold you till I can't feel again  
Until your soul lets me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve the love  
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah  
  
[Verse 3]  
Woman and man, fight so hard  
But when the two become one, we work out our problems  
And we fix i, whenever we get body to body  
Body to body, body to body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
When you so wet and I'm so hard  
And when the two become one, it's like oh my God  
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body  
Leave our body, leave our body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
  
[Bridge]  
Until your soul lets me in  
I want to  
  
[Verse 4]  
Woman and man, fight so hard  
But when the two become one, we work out our problems  
And we fix it, whenever we get body to body  
Body to body, body to body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
When you so wet and I'm so hard  
And when the two become one, it's like oh my God  
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body  
Leave our body, leave our body  
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)  
(I want you)  
  
[Outro]  
Until your soul lets me in  
(Uh, still here)  
Oooh, ooh  
(I feel you there baby, I feel ?)  
Say you'll never leave me, say you'll never go  
I love you so much
