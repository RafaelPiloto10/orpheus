Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Hot to trot, she's a bit insane  
Little bit a pleasure  
With a little bit a pain  
I got to be smokin'  
So I know without a doubt  
Where there's smoke there's fire  
So I gotta boot it out  
Say oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Homely child with a hang down lip  
Starved for love and companionship  
Little by little, catchin' up to me  
She's more of a woman  
Then I thought she'd be to me...yeah  
Hungry girl, she's the skinniest thing  
She's sayin' the word, I'm losin' sting ?  
She's on fire  
She hung my head in a guillotine  
She's my flame, she's a wettin' my dream  
She's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire
