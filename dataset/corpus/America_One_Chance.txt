(Gerry Beckley)  
  
One chance  
For a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together  
  
You soon will start running baby,  
I know you will.  
Though I've seen it coming lately,  
I love you still.  
How long must I keep on trying  
To change your mind?  
How long till there's no denying  
We're out of time?  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
Where are you goin' baby?  
Where have you been?  
I don't even know you lately,  
Let me back in.  
I guess I'll just keep on waiting,  
It's all I can do.  
Feels like the future's fadin' into the blue.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
One chance  
For a true love  
If a heart breaks  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,
