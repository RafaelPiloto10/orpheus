I don't want nobody  
If I can't have you  
Oh, I can't love nobody  
Unless I'm loving you  
  
The way you hug me  
The way you squeeze me  
The way you kiss me  
  
If I can't have you  
  
I can't talk to nobody  
Unless I'm talking to you  
I don't wanna hold nobody  
Unless I'm holding you  
  
I can't be kissing nobody  
Unless I'm kissing you  
I just don't  
I just don't  
I just don't want to be bothered with nobody  
Unless I'm bothered with you  
  
The way you hug me  
The way you squeeze me  
The way you kiss me  
  
If I can't have you
