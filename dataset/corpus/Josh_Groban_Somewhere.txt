Charlotte:  
There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
Josh:  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together and time to spare  
Time to learn time to care  
Some day  
Somewhere  
  
Charlotte:  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
  
Both:  
Somewhere  
  
Josh:  
There's a place for us  
  
Charlotte:  
A time and place for us  
  
Both:  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow  
Some day  
Somewhere
