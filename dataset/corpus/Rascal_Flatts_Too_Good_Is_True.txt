I guess it's cause and effect  
Your heart and mine  
The way that we connect  
Keeps blowing my mind  
There you go again, it never ends  
What you do to me  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have seen the light of day  
Love is finally going my way  
Is it too good to be true  
Give me one more kiss, one more touch  
Baby, I just can't get enough of you  
This time too good is true  
  
All of a sudden  
I'm not who I used to be  
I had my heart locked  
But you held the key  
And you find a way, everday  
To show me even more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some people say we're too good to be true  
But they don't get to be loved by you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh this time, too good is true  
Yes it is, yeah
