Sweet emotion  
Sweet emotion  
  
You talk about things that nobody cares  
You're wearing out things that nobody wears  
You're calling my name but I gotta make clear  
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
When some sweet hog mama with a face like a gent  
Said my get up and go must've got up and went  
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar  
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Sweet emotion  
Sweet emotion  
  
When I pulled into town in a police car  
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far  
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied  
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died  
Yes it did  
  
You stand in the front just a shakin' your ass  
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass  
Your telling me things I can sure understand  
'Cause a month on the road an' I'll be eating from your hand
