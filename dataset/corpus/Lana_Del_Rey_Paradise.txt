Ooh, ooh. (What?)  
Ooh, ooh. (That's dope)  
Ooh, ooh. (What?)  
Ooh, ooh.  
  
Love you like I never loved anyone,  
Keep me burning hot like the red, red sun.  
Want you like I never wanted anyone,  
You give it to me fast like free and fun.  
  
Every time with you,  
It feels like I'm in summer,  
I don't know why.  
Maybe cause you're so cool and keep it down on the real, like sugar, sugar  
Fly.  
  
Boy you're sweet like sugar cane,  
Make me feel alive again.  
  
I'm going down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.  
(Rock you like a real bad baby)  
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice.  
(You up and make you crazy)  
  
Shot, hot, give me what you got,  
You can buy my hot supersonic pop.  
Goin' down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.  
  
Want you like I've never wanted anyone,  
Got a face like God and a bod' like John.  
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone,  
Cause you keep it really rough like oh my God.  
  
Every time with you I can tell it's forever,  
I don't know how.  
And even if it's not, you know I couldn't stop,  
You make my heart go pow.  
  
Coming down like pouring,  
Make me feel alive again.  
  
I'm going down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.  
(Rock you like a real bad baby)  
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice.  
(You up and make you crazy)  
  
Shot, hot, give me what you got,  
You can buy my hot supersonic pop.  
Goin' down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.  
  
Ooh, ooh. Dope!  
Ooh, ooh. That's sick!  
Ooh, ooh. Dope!  
Ooh, ooh. That's sick!  
  
I'm going down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.  
(Rock you like a real bad baby)  
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice.  
(You up and make you crazy)  
  
Shot, hot, give me what you got,  
You can buy my hot supersonic pop.  
Goin' down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.
