What'aya say girl, we do somethin' crazy  
Quit puttin' it off, you know what I'm sayin'  
Ain't like it ain't gonna happen, forever's a given  
It's already written  
Who we kiddin' baby, come on  
  
The stars can't line up any straighter  
Let's do it now and think about it later  
  
Why wait another minute  
For somethin' we should'a done yesterday?  
I know a little church  
With a preacher who could hook us up right away  
Love don't need a reason  
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today  
So why wait  
  
Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble  
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle  
Girl it just so happens, that ring that you wanted  
Well guess what I bought it  
It's in my pocket baby, come on  
  
Let's get it done, let's get it on your left hand  
This is me, girl, poppin' the question  
  
Why wait another minute  
For somethin' we should'a done yesterday?  
I know a little church  
With a preacher who could hook us up right away  
Love don't need a reason  
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today  
So why wait  
  
Let's do something crazy  
'Cause crazy's what you make me  
  
Why wait another minute  
Wait another minute come on (come on)  
Well I know a little church  
With a preacher who could hook us up right away  
Love don't need a reason  
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today  
So why wait  
Why wait  
  
What'aya say girl we do somethin' crazy
