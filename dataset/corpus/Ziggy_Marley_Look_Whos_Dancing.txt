Oh look who's dancing

Well, first the dance floor  
Was like a forbidden land  
Where people would never dare to go  
But now everyone's doing it  
I said it's a dance galore  
  
Look who's dancing

Some are jumping off the floor  
And look at old Granny "be "  
She got the, she caught the, she knows the groove for sure

Do the ska, the rock steady, the ridim and blues  
And if you catch them, then you do the della move  
It nuh mek nuh sense to sit down, when you know you can goove  
Any type of danve you do, you neither win or lose  
  
And if your choice is reggae, you don't need nuh dancing shoes  
Suh listen to the message, and you know you won't lose  
Look who come, come dancing pow we dancing floor again  
Some a dem a enemy, some a dem a friend  
  
Some a dem a mother and father, some a dem a children  
Some a dem a loafer who a follow the trend  
And some a dem a just dey ya as we good brethen
