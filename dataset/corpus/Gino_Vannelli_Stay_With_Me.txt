Hey woman walking on a wire  
I know your back is to the wall  
What lies in water lies in fire  
It's all in how you take the fall  
Why don't you stay with me  
Oh, lay with me  
Don't turn the lights on me  
Tonight on me  
(stay with me)  
The streets are cold in new york city  
Why don't we break the ice  
Now just like a fool I'll be feeling guilty  
So just this once I won't think twice  
Why don't you stay with me  
Oh, lay with me  
The only crime I see  
Is killing time with me  
(stay with me)  
And oh, what a feeling  
When I'm with you  
You play with fire  
What am I supposed to do  
Hey woman life's too short to straddle  
You're either right or wrong  
So come on gamble  
Just don't keep me hanging on  
Why don't you stay with me  
Oh lay with me  
The only crime I see  
Is killing time with me
