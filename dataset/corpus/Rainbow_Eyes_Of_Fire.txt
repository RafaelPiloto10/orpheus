Hungry and wild she was born to the night  
A demon, a daughter of madness  
One look from her eyes could burn you alive  
Drown you in oceans of sadness  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide from her eyes of fire  
  
Face in the mirror we meet eye to eye  
Passions of eternal fire  
Desperately wanting and out of control  
Dancing on winds of desire  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide from her eyes of fire  
  
Curtain of darkness, screams of delight  
Taunts me with her sirens calling  
I got to be strong but I can't hang on  
Into the flames I am falling  
Oh even the deadly shades of night  
Won't let me hide (no, no, no, no)  
From her eyes of fire  
  
She keeps burning  
She keeps burning me, burning me, burning  
Me, burning me down  
Eyes of fire  
Oh no
