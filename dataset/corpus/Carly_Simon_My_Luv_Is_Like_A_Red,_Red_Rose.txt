My love is like a red, red rose  
That's newly strung in June  
My love is like a melody  
That's sweetly played in tune  
  
As far art thou, my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still, my dear  
Til all the seas gang dry  
Til all the seas gang dry  
  
Till all the seas gang dry, my dear  
And the rocks melt with the sun  
I will love thee still, my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
  
And fare thee well, my only love  
And fare thee well a while  
And I will come again, my love  
Though it were ten thousand miles  
Though it were ten thousand miles
