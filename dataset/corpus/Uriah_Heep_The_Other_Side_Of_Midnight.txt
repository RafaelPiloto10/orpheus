Late at night I'll be knocking  
On your door  
Late tonight I'll be calling  
You can be sure  
I'll be waiting  
Standin' in the shadows once again  
Sneakin', creepin'  
Howling like a tom cat once again  
  
Oh, there'll be nowhere  
You can hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
  
You know I don't love you  
But I love what you can do  
Some more of that hot persuasion  
This time it's ? just like you  
  
Oh, there'll be nowhere  
You can hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
I'll be knockin'  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be callin'  
The other side of midnight  
Knock, knockin'  
The other side of midnight  
  
I'm gonna take you  
I'm gonna make you  
At midnight, at midnight  
  
Late at night  
I'll be knock knock knockin'  
On your door  
I said late tonight I'll be callin'  
You can be sure  
I'm gonna take you  
Oh, it's gonna hurt so good  
I'm gonna make you do  
What a bad girl should  
  
Oh, there'll be nowhere to hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be knockin'  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be callin'  
The other side of midnight  
On the other side  
I'll be waitin', I'll be callin'  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be knock knock  
Knockin' at midnight
