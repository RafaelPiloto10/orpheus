Give me a ride on your roller coaster  
Give me a thrill, I can't help feelin' bored  
Give me a dime to call my baby closer  
'cause I'm alone, I'm feelin' bored  
I can't help thinking I'm ignored  
  
I've been away far too long to recall  
Just what it's like to be among my friends  
Give me a pill to ease my nervous tension  
'cause I can't hardly see the end  
I long to be among my friends  
  
I've been on the road for too long, I don't know  
I'm walking around and I don't know where to go.  
Well I'm half-crazed and I don't know who to be  
Won't you please! Help me please!  
Won't you please! I long to be at ease!  
  
Give me a ride on your magic carpet  
Take me away from this mediocrity  
What must I do to get me feeling better  
I guess it all boils down to me  
Responsibility's on me
