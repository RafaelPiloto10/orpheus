I can't help thinkin' as those ships sail away  
What sirens beckon and call  
How long at sea this time how long between  
The ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge they move to far off lands  
Maybe Australia or North African sands  
Complete the mission, supply and demand  
To ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
When they'll be casting off anchor as they sail away  
Into the morning light  
Rising and falling through the blue and gray  
To ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
I'll take the chance this time to change my world (change my world)  
And break those ties that bind (ties that bind)  
Far from those people passing through my life  
Like ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge I'll move to far off lands (far off lands)  
Maybe Australia or North African sands (North African sands)  
Complete my mission, hope you understand  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call ...
