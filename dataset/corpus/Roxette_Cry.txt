Living here without you is not an easy way of life.  
I spend my time without you, I try to make it all worthwhile.  
Standing in a rainfall coming down from the sky.  
Why should I cry over you?  
Why should I cry cry cry over you?  
I keep on thinking about you.  
I've got no private pride to hide.  
I've built my world around you like a call without reply.  
My love has lost direction, she's got the sun in her eyes.  
Why should I cry...  
Hearing your footsteps, loud on my stairs (a-walking...)--living without you.  
Feeling the sweet sweet smell of love in the air (I can feel it...)--living  
without you.  
Kissing the face that I see everywhere but I'm living without you, living  
without.  
Why should I cry cry cry over you?  
Oh, hearing your footsteps, loud on my stairs (a-walking...)--living without  
you.  
Kissing the face that I see everywhere but  
I'm living without you, I'm living without.  
Cry cry cry over you? Why should I cry...
