Oh Eve, where is Adam?  
I see you've been kept  
Out of the garden  
And I said  
Oh, Eve, where is Adam?  
Now you've been kept  
Out of the garden  
I have wandered from shore to shore  
Don't you find that there's no more  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Don't you wish  
Love alone  
Don't you wish  
Love  
Don't you wish  
Love alone  
Don't you wish  
Love  
Don't you wish love alone  
Could save the world from disaster  
Is only love, inner confusion  
Is it just one more illusion  
And I said  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Well, if you want to have great love  
You've got to have great anger  
Well, if you want to have great love  
You've got to have great anger  
When I see innocent folks shot down  
Should I just shake my head and frown  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Girl if you want to hit the target square  
You've gotta look out (for it not happening there)?  
Or else it'll be just one more time  
The correction creates another crime  
Girl if you want to hit the target square  
You better not have right angles  
Oh, just keep one more time  
For the correction creates another crime  
  
Oh, Eve, you tell Adam  
Next time he asks you  
You say baby it's cold outside  
What's the password  
To come inside  
You say  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom haywah  
  
Oh Eve go tell Adam  
We've got to build a new garden  
Oh Eve go tell Adam  
We've got to build a new garden  
Got to get working on a building  
A decent home for all of god's children  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Well if music  
Could only bring peace  
I'd only be a musician  
Well if music  
Could only bring peace  
I'd only be a musician  
Well if songs could do more than  
Dull this pain  
And all melodies bravely changed well  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Four thousand languages in this world  
Doesn't mean the same thing  
To every boy and girl  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
(save the world from disaster  
Well if only love....  
...well I sad...  
...just one more illusion...  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah)
