High tide  
In the cool of the mist  
Walking in the shadows of the trade ships  
I'll be your baby  
I will not be your man  
I will not be around when you call  
Oh Daddy  
I'll be Daddy's little girl  
Black water  
The warm summer rain  
Washes your tears in to the big snake  
Into the ocean  
And your skin is so white under harbour light  
Should you fall I'll be your baby  
Say I'll be daddy's little girl  
Oh Daddy  
I'm all alone now  
Hush little baby  
Don't you cry  
I will sing you a lullaby  
It's high tide  
In the still of your room  
And the big snake's a crawling  
Through the smoke and perfume  
To be your baby  
I will not be your man  
I will be around when you fall  
I'll be your baby  
I'll be Daddy's little girl  
Say it be my Daddy  
I'll be Daddy's little girl  
Oh Daddy  
We're all alone now  
Won't you be my Daddy  
We're all alone now...
