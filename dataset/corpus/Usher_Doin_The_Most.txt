This is just to show my appreciation  
For all of your love  
For all of these years  
  
[Chorus]  
Your doin' the most (yeah, yeah)  
I wanna learn (oh yeah, yeah)  
To understand (oh baby, baby yeah)  
And I like it babe (and I like babe)  
Listen  
  
You there for me  
Everytime  
You make sure that I'm  
Alright  
  
Down for me  
With so much love  
No matter what  
I can't believe you deal with me  
  
Even when I put you down  
How can you keep giving?  
When I disappoint you  
You don't deserve it  
  
But why do you take it?  
'Cause you say I'm worth it  
  
[Chorus]  
Your doin' the most (show me baby)  
I wanna learn (teach me suga)  
To understand  
How to love and please you (yeah)  
Like you do every time I need you (oh, oh yeah)  
  
Your doin' the most (you're doin' the most)  
I wanna learn (I wanna learn)  
To understand  
I sampled a taste of your forever  
And I like it babe (and I like it babe)  
  
It been a minute since we spent some time  
I was in the wrong state of mind  
Hope I can fix it  
With dinner by candlelight  
  
A dozen roses  
Hershey kisses for the ground you walk on  
If I never told you  
I'm so proud to say your mine  
  
My time and attention  
I'm willing to give it  
I don't wanna lose you  
I couldn't take it  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah your doin' the most (your doin' the most)  
I wanna learn (teach me suga)  
To understand  
How to love and please you (yeah)  
Like you do every time I need ya (oh, oh baby)  
  
You doin' the most (doin' the most, yeah)  
I wanna learn (I wanna learn)  
To understand  
Say I sampled a taste of your forever  
And I like it babe (Ooo girl I like it)  
I like it babe  
  
[Bridge]  
I used to have my dimes  
Love was just a game to me  
But now I know why love's so amazing  
Because it changed me  
  
You never gave up  
And now I know  
True love's not taken  
Thank God you're who you are  
  
'Cause you gave love  
From your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Your doin' the most (your doin' the most)  
I wanna learn (I wanna learn yeah)  
To understand  
Like you do everytime I need you  
  
You doin' the most (show me baby)  
I wanna learn (I wanna learn)  
To understand  
Sampled a taste of your forever  
And I like it babe (Ooo girl I like it babe)  
I like it babe  
  
All the times we fussed and fight  
Wanna make you feel good tonight  
This is your day suga  
Smile for me babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Your doin' the most (uh oh, your doing the most)  
I wanna learn (girl I really want to understand)  
To understand  
Sampled a taste of your forever  
And I like it babe (Ooh girl I like it)
