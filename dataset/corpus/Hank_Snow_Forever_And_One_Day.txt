How long will my teardrops be falling for you  
Forever and one day, forever and two  
How long will my arms ache to hold only you  
Forever and one day, forever and two  
  
Loving you with all my heart  
Believing you loved me  
But an imitation love was  
All you gave to me  
How long will my sweet dreams never come true  
Forever and one day, forever and two  
  
Loving you with all my heart  
Believing you loved me  
But an imitation love was  
All you gave to me  
How long will my sweet dreams never come true  
Forever and one day, forever and two  
  
Loving you with all my heart  
Believing you loved me  
But an imitation love was  
All you gave to me  
How long will my sweet dreams never come true  
Forever and one day, forever and two  
(Forever and one day, forever and two)
