Stay, please stay with me tonight  
And all the stars up in my Heaven  
They're shinin' bright  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it, if you stay  
Oh, I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby, baby  
I know it hurts but it hurts me more and more  
I hear your heartbeat, baby louder than before  
And when I cry, I cry for you  
'Cause I know you are the only  
And when I die, I die for you  
'Cause I know your heart is lonely  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
I will catch you, if you fall  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it from my heart  
I will try, oh if you call  
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight  
Oh, I'm so lonely  
Don't leave me girl and all the feelings right  
Oh, you're the only  
I know it hurts you  
You are walking out my dreams  
You've set my heart on fire  
And now you're gone it seems  
My dying heart, it cries for you  
'Cause I know you are my only  
Don't break apart, can't let you go  
'Cause I know my heart is lonely  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it from my heart  
I will try, oh if you call  
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight  
Oh, I'm so lonely  
Don't leave me girl and all the feelings right  
Oh, you're the only  
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight  
Oh, I'm so lonely
