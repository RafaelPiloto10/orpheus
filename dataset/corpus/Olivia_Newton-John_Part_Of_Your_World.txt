Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?  
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl,  
The girl who has everything?  
Look at this trove, treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Lookin' around here you'd think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty  
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore  
You want thingamabobs?  
I got twenty  
But who cares?  
No big deal  
I want more  
  
I want to be where the people are  
I want to see  
want to see 'em dancing  
Walking around on those  
Whadd'ya call 'em? oh- feet  
Flipping your fins you don't get too far  
Legs are required for jumping, dancing  
Strolling along down a  
What's that word again? Street  
  
Up where they walk  
Up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wandering free  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give  
If I could live  
Out of these waters?  
What would I pay  
To spend a day  
Warm on the sand?  
Betcha on land  
They understand  
That they don't reprimand their daughters  
Bright young women  
Sick of swimming  
Ready to stand  
  
And ready to know what the people know  
Ask 'em my questions  
And get some answers  
What's a fire and why does it  
What's the word? burn?  
  
When's it my turn?  
Wouldn't I love  
Love to explore that shore above?  
Out of the sea  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world
