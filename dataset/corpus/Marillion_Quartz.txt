I can imagine nothing more tedious  
Than trying to have fun with you again  
Maybe it's just something in my mind  
But I hate feeling like I'm trying all the time  
It's a kind of lie  
When we pretend that we're still friends  
  
I'm sure you're not exactly short of people to  
hang out and laugh at your jokes  
Tell you you look great  
You wouldn't want me around  
Making it all feel "forced "  
And "put down"  
  
And every time I smile to wonder if I'm laughin' at you  
And with every little grin you don't want to be wonderin'  
Just exactly what it is I'm taking pleasure in  
  
Although I always said  
We were basically the same and all one  
All one  
It's so easy to persuade myself  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
  
I guess that irony  
Will surely be  
The death of me  
  
And every time I smile d'you wonder if I'm laughin' at you?  
And with every little grin you don't want to be wonderin'..  
  
Although I always said  
We were basically the same and all one  
All one  
It's so easy to persuade myself  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
  
You're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled  
You're only happy when you wind me up and I know  
You're so reliable it isn't true  
And it's so easy for me to break down  
If I could jump a ride between the skin and silicon then  
We could join hands and understand. Hallelujah!  
But I listen  
to the ticking  
I guess we're worlds apart  
It's so hard  
So hard  
  
I know there's no going back  
And you know there's no going back  
  
You're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled  
You're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled  
You're never happy  
  
I need maintenance  
I need patience  
I'm not foolproof  
I'm not waterproof  
I'm not shockproof  
Bombproof  
Bulletproof  
Fireproof  
Leakproof  
Childproof  
Stainproof  
Pressureproof  
  
I know I told myself  
We're all basically the same and all one all one  
why'know sometimes I just can't help myself  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
  
I know I never get the balance right  
And turn up half an hour late night after night  
And being totally dependable is so very commendable  
Although you're never wrong  
One of these days.. you're just gonna stop.
