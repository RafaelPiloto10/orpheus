Gonna catch a freight train as far as I can Lord,  
I don't care which way it goes  
Gonna climb a mountain, the highest mountain Lord  
Jump off ain't nobody gonna know.  
  
Can't you see, oh can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me  
Can't you see, can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me?  
  
Gonna buy a ticket go as far as I can Lord  
I ain't never coming back  
Take me a southbound all the way down Lord  
Till the train run out of track.  
  
Can't you see, oh can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me  
Can't you see, can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me?  
  
Can't you see, oh can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me  
Can't you see, can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me?
