We hear you crying  
So bitterly  
Trying to get people to help you ye ye  
But nobody will  
Your son was brutalizing people everytime.  
But you said nothing  
Now it's the time to pay the price  
It's time to pay ye ye ye ye  
  
[Chorus:]  
You gonna reap just what you sow (x4)  
  
Coming back home  
With stolen things  
Instead of telling him  
How wrong he was  
You told him how clever he was  
People coming out of burning houses  
It's your son Driving stolen cars every time  
It's your son,  
But you said nothing  
But now he's turning against you  
  
[Chorus:]  
You gonna reap just what you sow (x3)  
  
Everybody knows  
No jail can keep him  
'Cause you rubbing shoulders with the law  
But now it's time to pay the price wo... woh  
Chorus till fade
