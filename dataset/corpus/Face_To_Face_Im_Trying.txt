Four year old at play  
Shot and killed today  
Never even had a chance  
Seventeen and high  
Threw away his life  
Has a gun to feel like he's a man  
Can't have it any other way  
  
Laying in the street  
Asking for a drink  
Doesn't have a place to live  
Pregnant at thirteen  
Still can hear the screams  
Something that she never will forget  
Can't have it any other way  
  
I'm trying to open my mind  
  
So you can keep your faith  
And I'll just walk away  
There's no reason for me to stay  
  
I'm trying to open my mind  
I'm trying to make up my mind
