I'm running away  
I've got to get home  
I'm lost in a crowd  
But I'm still on my own  
I'm looking ahead  
So I'm staying behind  
I'm not being cruel  
I'm just being kind  
I close my eyes  
It's no surprise  
I'm always there  
Can't count the times  
I've tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
I'm trying to lay low  
But I keep getting high  
My feet on the ground  
Got my head in the sky  
My eye on the future  
That's stuck in the past  
I find I can't lose  
When I aim to come last  
  
I realize  
It's no surprise  
That nothing's clear  
That black is white  
That day is night  
And there is here  
  
I'm right on the ball  
But I'm missing the mark  
I burn in the sun  
I'm scared of the dark  
Got an ivory tower  
With a bird's eye view  
Got plenty of time  
But nothing to do  
  
The best disguise  
It's no surprise  
Is disappear  
Can't count the times  
I've tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
I'm running away  
I've got to get home  
I'm lost in a crowd  
But I'm still on my own  
I'm looking ahead  
So I'm staying behind  
I'm not being cruel  
I'm just being kind  
  
I realize  
It's no surprise  
That nothing's clear  
That black is white  
That day is night  
And there is here  
  
The best disguise  
It's no surprise  
Is disappear  
Can't count the times  
I've tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
I close my eyes  
It's no surprise  
I'm always there  
Can't count the times  
I've tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
I realize  
It's no surprise  
That nothing's clear  
That black is white  
That day is night  
And there is here  
  
The best disguise  
It's no surprise  
Is disappear  
Can't count the times  
I've tried to hide  
And found nowhere
