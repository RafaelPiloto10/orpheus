Ain't got no trouble in my life  
No foolish dream to make me cry  
I'm never frightened or worried  
You know I always get by  
I heat up  
I cool down  
Something gets in my way I go around it  
Don't let life get me down  
Gonna take it the way that I found it  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
  
You say that life is a circle  
But that ain't the way that I found it  
Oh... gonna move in a straight line  
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground  
I heat up  
I cool down  
I got words in my head so I sing them  
Don't let life get me down  
I can't hold onto the blues, so I play them  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me
