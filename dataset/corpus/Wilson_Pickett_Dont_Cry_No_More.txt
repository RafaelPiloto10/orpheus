One, two, one, two, three, four  
  
Lord, have mercy  
Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears  
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears  
I know, I know, know that you love me real  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Don't cry, don't cry, I'm begging you  
Don't cry no more, baby, I'm begging you  
Every tear you shed will tell me that your love is true  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Lord, have mercy  
Cry me the river, cry me a sea  
Now I believe without a doubt  
You really, really, really love me  
  
I don't want you to cry  
I don't want you to cry  
Dry your eyes, dry your eyes  
  
I'll be your water, when you're thirsty  
I'll be your [Incomprehensible], when you're fallin' on down  
  
Oh, baby, dry your eyes, lean on me  
I'll stick by you, I'll stick by you  
I'll be your bread, in a starry land
