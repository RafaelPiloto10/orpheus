[Chorus]  
I can show you the paws my balls  
The Taj Mahals to the strip in M.I.A.  
I can show the waterfalls in Spain and Prague  
To the beach in St. Tropes  
I can show you the world girl the world girl  
But ain't nothing else like L.A.  
I can show you the world girl the world girl  
But ain't nothing else like L.A.  
Nothing like L.A.  
  
When they come to L.A. they got the wrong impression  
When they come to L.A. they gotta learn they lesson  
When they come to west coast it's such an obsession  
When they come to play it out I'm just an exception  
When it comes to girl I need your affection  
Every time you walk by you get my inspection  
All you gotta do now is make your selection  
And it won't be hard to win this election  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I done been around the world I ain't impress  
I can't wait till we hit L.A.X  
Yea Tokyo is cool and yea I feel the UK  
But can't nothing can fuck with California  
Especially L.A. and I'm feeling the bay  
But ain't nothing like rolling down P.C.H.  
Top down west bound it's all good  
You don't go Hollywood when you're from Hollywood  
Let's go to the hood and fuck with the haters  
Then head to the Staples Center and hang with the Lakers  
Number six is cool but number twenty four is the champ  
And even D Wade and Chris Bosh know that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The B.E.T. awards and even the Grammy's  
They always pick L.A. over Miami  
I love Miami I ain't dissing Miami  
But where would you rather get robbed for your Grammy?  
Ain't nothing like Sunset Boulevard  
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard  
We got it all what you thought not at all  
If you sick of this shit than take a Tylenol  
It's just me and my woman verses all of y'all  
And we taking a bow for our curtain call  
The angels are lost they don't wanna be found  
If God is looking for 'em I can show him around  
  
[Chorus]
