Angel face  
We've just met  
Just how lucky can one boy get  
There's a light in your eye  
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy  
With a girl like you  
Tell your mom tell your pa  
And tell your favourite old wishing star  
We're in love, just by chance  
I asked you would like to dance  
Fancy dancing with a girl like you  
Funny how love can come to a lonely heart  
I'm a boy, you're a girl I guess that's a pretty start  
Here I am, there you are  
Together baby we should go far  
A girl like you, a boy like me  
Two hearts together like they ought to be  
Can't believe  
I've got a girl like
