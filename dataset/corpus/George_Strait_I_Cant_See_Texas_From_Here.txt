come and go as I please.  
From down here, up North and inbetween,  
But baby it's a shame 'cause I always feel the same  
When I can't see Texas from here.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't see Texas from here.  
No matter how I try, it makes me want to cry.  
So if you see me lookin' down,  
I'm tryin' not to show this frown  
'Cause I can't see Texas from here.  
  
I can't say I don't like Tennessee.  
The people here have all been good to me.  
So please don't take offense if I start to get intense  
Just 'cause I can't see Texas from here.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
'Cause I can't see Texas, I can't see Texas,  
I can't see Texas from here.
