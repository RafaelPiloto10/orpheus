Highway run, into the midnight sun  
Wheels go round and round  
You're on my mind  
Restless hearts, sleep alone tonight  
Sending all my love along the wire  
  
They say that the road  
Ain't no place to start a family  
Right down the line it's been you and me  
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be  
Oh boy, you stand by me  
I'm forever yours  
Faithfully  
  
Circus life, under the big top world  
We all need the clowns to make us smile  
Oh, through space and time  
Through space and time  
Always another show  
Wonderin' where I am, lost without you  
  
And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair  
Two strangers learn to fall in love again  
I get the joy of rediscovering you  
Oh girl, you stand by me  
I'm forever yours  
Faithfully  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Faithfully  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Faithfully  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
I'm still yours  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I'm still yours  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I'm still yours  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Faithfully
