A man once said love is all you need  
And if not right he was close indeed  
It won't pay the rent  
Won't buy your shoes  
But it's time well spent if it keeps away the blues  
It won't turn the tide or stop the rain  
And deep down inside there might be a little pain  
But you still go through it  
'Cause it gets you through the night  
'Cause when you get down to it love is all right  
  
Love is all right  
Love is all right  
Oh, love is all right  
  
When your girl walks out you just want her back  
You got to have her now and that's a fact Jack  
'Cause as big and bad and mean as you are  
You can't watch you're woman in another man's car  
You want to keep that girl in you're passenger seat  
You want to find her groove, want to keep her beat  
So if you have to do it, you're ready to fight  
'Cause when you get down to it love is all right
