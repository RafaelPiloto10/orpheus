I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride  
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide  
It's sooner than I thought but you called me out  
I've lost control and there's no doubt  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
[Chorus]  
Out of the fire and into the fire again  
You make me want to forget  
And start all over  
Here it comes straight out of my mind or worse  
Another chance to get burned  
And start all over  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
Fantastic and romantic all a big surprise  
You've got the warning hesitation pushed aside  
It's sooner than i want but you caught my heart  
I guess I'm ready now to start  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
It's so easy  
You disrupt me  
Can't complain  
  
It's so easy  
I'm gonna start all over  
  
[Chorus: x2]
