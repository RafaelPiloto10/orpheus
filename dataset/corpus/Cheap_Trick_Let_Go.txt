I took your photographs, I threw them all away  
I put your calls on hold 'cause I got nothin' to say  
Hangin' on to you, that was my first mistake  
Yeah, yeah  
  
But some things you can never let go  
Some things you can never let go  
  
You took the credit cards, you took the bank account  
You took my sanity. you've got me all drawn out  
I'd give it all away to get you off my mind  
Yeah, yeah  
  
But some things you can never let go  
Some things you should never let 'em show  
Some things you can never let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go of my heart  
  
I took your photographs, I threw them all aside  
Forget your so called friends, I kissed 'em all goodbye  
If I walk away, would you be satisfied?  
Yeah, yeah  
  
But some things you can never let go  
Some things you should never let show  
Some things you can never let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go of my heart  
  
Some things you can never let go  
Some things you can never let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go  
  
Let go, let go  
Don't keep draggin' it out  
Let go, let go  
You're no good for me now  
How much more can I take?  
I can't spend my whole life in the dark  
Now you gotta let go  
Gotta let go  
Gotta let go  
Gotta let go of my heart
