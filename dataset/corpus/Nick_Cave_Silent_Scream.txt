White dress, torture in discuise, pointing flashlight right into my eyes,  
sharp pain every single night-, every day I fight a hopeless fight  
I look, over thirty years, I've wished that I was dead  
somebody help me out, because I'm tied down to my bed.  
  
I'm looking for someone to release me  
I'm waiting for an angel from my dreams  
I'm talking to all of you around me  
I'm asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
  
Dear god, gave me such a life  
full of pain, its sharp just like a knife  
I can think, but I cannot tell,  
Wots life to you, to me is hell  
I hear the storm outside-first drop just hit the roof  
id die to see the rain, but I can not, can not move.  
  
I'm looking for someone to release me  
I'm waiting for an angel from my dreams  
I'm talking to all of you around me  
I'm asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
  
If living is my cross, so let me die, or crucify me now,  
but tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
  
(musical interlude)  
  
Time stayes still, only I can feel when the darkness will apear  
everyday, I've wished away, oh please, please take away my pain,  
  
I'm looking for someone to release me  
I'm waiting for an angel from my dreams  
I'm talking to all of you around me  
I'm asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
Yea yea yea yea,
