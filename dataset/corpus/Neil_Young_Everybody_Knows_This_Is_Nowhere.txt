I think I'd like to go  
Back home  
And take it easy  
There's a woman that  
I'd like to get to know  
Living there  
  
Everybody seems to wonder  
What it's like down here  
I gotta get away  
From this day-to-day  
Running around,  
Everybody knows  
This is nowhere.  
  
Everybody, everybody knows  
Everybody knows.  
  
Every time I think about  
Back home  
It's cool and breezy  
I wish that I could be there  
Right now  
Just passing time.  
  
Everybody seems to wonder  
What it's like down here  
I gotta get away  
From this day-to-day  
Running around,  
Everybody knows  
This is nowhere.  
  
Everybody, everybody knows  
Everybody knows.
