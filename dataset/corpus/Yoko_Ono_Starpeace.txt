"Calling earth! calling earth!"  
"Eh...who? "  
"Are you listening? are you listening? "  
"Is this a long distance call? "  
"Mommy? "  
"Oh, good, you're on, too, sean, stay on, something's wrong with this"  
"Don't be afraid! don't be afraid!"  
"You sound familiar, you sound like...sound like me actually."  
"That's because we conditioned our vibrations to yours."  
"Aha! are you getting that, Sean? "  
"You will not blow up earth! you will not blow up earth!"  
"Oh, that's good to know."  
"You are wisdom, you are love."  
  
Human civilization is in a state of hibernation,  
We'll grow to know the planets full distribution.  
The world as our reflection will regain it's circulation,  
Our life span will meet our life plan of starpeace.  
  
Human civilization is in a state of isolation,  
We'll learn to reach out for terrestrial communications.  
We'll make our first migration from earth to other constellations,  
Our life span will meet out life plane of starpeace.  
  
Love is our energy source, wisdom is our power source.  
Health is our nature resource,  
Growth is our future resource.  
  
Join the state of the universe,  
United state of peace.  
Join the state of the universe,  
United state of peace.
