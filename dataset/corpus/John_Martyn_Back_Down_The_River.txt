I know that we're gonna be together, you and me  
For more than a rhyme or two, your time belongs to me  
Rowing back down my river, chasing my tail to the sea  
Rowing back down my river, trying my best to be me  
Watching your crazy ways and all the lazy days  
Digging you more and more the more I see your face  
Rowing back down my river, trying my best to be free  
Rowing back down my river, chasing my tail to the sea  
Watching the simple things to help me grow along  
Loving the note she bring to help me sing my song  
Rowing back down my river, trying my best to be me  
Rowing back down my river, singing my songs to the sea  
I know that we're gonna be together, you and me  
For more than a time or two, your rhymes belongs to me
