Farewell old friend  
Leave me now be gone  
My soul is weak  
My mind is never strong  
Watch my hands at night  
And see the way they're shaking  
See the endless road  
See the way it's taking  
And it's still the same old night  
And it still just don't seem right  
And this darkness blinds my eyes  
Writing down my life  
On endless scraps of paper  
Years of hanging round  
A life of wasted labor  
And it's still the same old night  
And somehow it don't feel right  
And this darkness blinds my eyes  
Goodnight old friend  
I'll see you once again  
The dawn will come  
And haunt me once again  
Watch my life unfold  
And see the shape it's taking  
Watch my fingers write  
And see the way they're shaking  
And it's still the same old night  
And somehow it don't feel right  
And this darkness blinds my eyes  
Goodnight old friend  
I'll see you once again  
The dawn will come  
And haunt us once again  
And it's still the same old night  
And it's still the same old night  
And it's still the same old night  
Ah, it's still the same old night
