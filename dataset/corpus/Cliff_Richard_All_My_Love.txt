All my love  
Came to nothin' at all my love  
When I woke up to find  
You were no longer mine  
All my love  
Throw away after all this time  
Now there's no place for me  
In the future you see  
I don't understand you  
I've done all I can do  
Tell me how could I give you more  
More than all my love  
All my love  
Came to nothin' at all my love  
When I woke up to find  
You were no longer mine  
All my love  
Throw away after all this time  
Now there's no place for me  
In the future you see  
I don't understand you  
I've done all I can do  
Tell me how could I give you more  
More than all my love  
All my love  
Came to nothin' at all my love  
When I woke up to find  
You were no longer mine  
All my love  
Throw away after all this time  
Now there's no place for me  
In the future you see  
All my love  
Came to nothin' at all my love
