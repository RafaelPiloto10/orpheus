(Traditional)  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet
head  
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay the little Lord Jesus asleep on
the hay  
  
[ vibes ]  
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes but little Lord Jesus no crying he makes  
I love our Lord Jesus look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh  
  
[ vibes ]  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed...
