Do you remember  
Every morning  
We would dress  
And we'd be still yawning,  
In the street  
Where people meet  
We would wander around  
In the northern heat.  
  
All these days are gone  
My Baby, now I'm all alone  
I wish I had you near me  
Baby, I wish I had you here  
  
In the summer  
Days were lazy  
And sometimes the heat  
Would drive us all crazy  
Singing songs all night long  
Till the light through' the window  
Said another day had come  
  
All these days are gone  
Baby, now I'm all alone  
I wish I had you near me  
I wish I had you here.  
  
Baby, do you remember  
Every morning  
We would dress  
And we'd be still yawning,  
In the street  
Where people meet  
We would wander around  
In the northern heat.  
  
Baby, oh these days are gone  
And I'm all alone  
I still remember  
The good old days we spent together  
Baby I can't forget  
You know me  
I can't forget  
The good old days we spent together.
