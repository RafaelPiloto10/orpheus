The little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
We got married in a little white church  
I had a big red rose on my shirt  
You had some flowers but you gave them away  
And the little green flower was bloomin' that day  
It's that little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
Remember the night that I came home drunk  
Stopped in the driveway got you a bunch  
You got mad said they shouldn't be picked  
They were there next morning when I woke up sick  
It's that little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
It's been a long time since I gave you that ring  
You often said I didn't know a bloomin' thing  
But happy anniversary and look what I got  
Some little green flowers with the yellow on top
