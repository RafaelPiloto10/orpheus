Hey, doesn't it still look easy as it did to you  
Hey, wasn't it true, after all  
I couldn't help myself, girl  
And I can't blame you  
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall  
  
Living on old illusions, and some make believe  
That mattered to me, most of all  
Closing my eyes to changes I've refused to see  
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall  
  
Somewhere in your future, on the far side of your world  
You might read my writing on the wall  
And think of the easy dreamer who believed in you  
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall.  
  
If someday you wake up in a world that's turned on you  
And nobody answers when you call  
Hey, think of the easy dreamer who believes in you  
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall  
  
Think of the crazy dreamer who believes in you  
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall.
