What a dying world re-defines, the reasons we strive to exist  
Refrain control and we're bound to learn the meaning of moments like this  
'Cause in the peaceful lull, the quiet  
Seduced by the promise of bliss, we soon forget that nothing's happened yet  
We're living for moments like this  
  
So hold me, whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn who we are  
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this  
  
From the dim light in the greyness, the aim of the soul tends to miss  
Then the clouds catch fire and the oceans pitch  
We're made for the moments like this  
  
So hold me, whisper gently that there's nothing to fear  
You'll always be near, to remind me, to stand behind me  
Although life can be rough we can never give up  
  
It's in our power to face the storm with all its fury and madness  
The flash of thunder will be harnessed with the longing and sadness  
The clouds will grey.  
  
Hold me. Whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn how we are  
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this  
Hold me. Whisper gently that there's nothing to fear,  
You'll always be near, to remind me, stand behind me  
Although life can be rough we can never give up.
