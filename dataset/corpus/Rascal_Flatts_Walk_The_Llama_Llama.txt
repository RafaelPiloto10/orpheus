Walk The llama llama  
Walk The llama llama  
Take in the panorama  
Walk The llama llama - llama llama  
Don't have to be a drama  
Walk The llama llama - llama llama  
No one could be calmer  
Walk The llama llama  
Walk The llama llama  
Double L. A. M. A  
  
Fluff up your fur  
Stick out your chest  
Walk The llama llama  
Now your looking your best  
Keep out the wind  
Keep out the snow  
Wool by llama from head to toe  
  
Walk The llama llama - llama llama  
Take in the panorama  
Walk The llama llama  
Walk The llama llama  
Double L. A. M. A  
  
Cool in the summer  
Warm in the cold  
A perfect fashion statement  
For the young and the old  
A cloak for the priest  
A hat for the farmer  
You could be looking at the emperor's pajamas  
  
That's way the llama walks so proud  
That's way the llama holds his head up in the crowd  
All of us applaud his generosity  
He's more than just a passing curiosity  
He covers up our pride  
And all those things we have to hide  
In any civilized society  
  
Walk The llama llama
