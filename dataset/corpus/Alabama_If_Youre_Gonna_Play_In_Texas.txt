If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
That lead guitar is hot,  
But not for "lousiana man".  
So rosin up that bow for "faded love"  
And let's all dance.  
If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
  
I remember down in houston  
We were puttin' on a show  
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled,  
"cotton-eyed joe"!  
He said, "we love what you're doin'.  
Boys don't get us wrong,  
There's just somethin' missin' in your song.  
  
Chorus  
  
So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight.  
Them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case.  
You say y'all all wanna two-step. You say ya wanna doe-si-doe.  
Well, here's a fiddlin' song before we go.  
  
Chorus  
Repeat and fade
