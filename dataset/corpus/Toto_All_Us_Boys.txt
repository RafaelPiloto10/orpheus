All us boys like to drink and smoke  
Pull off a joke  
Blow your minds and leave  
Hot tires behind  
  
All us boys like to fight and kick  
Carry a stick  
We're getting older  
And acting bolder  
  
[Chorus]  
Mothers tell your daughters  
To stay away from rock and roll  
'Cause it may entice them  
And mesmerize them  
Even satisfy their soul  
  
I'm sure mama told you 'bout making love  
And the skies above  
With its fallen angels  
Diet pills  
Female thrills  
But mama never told you 'bout  
All us boys  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All us boys just want to play  
All us boys won't run away
