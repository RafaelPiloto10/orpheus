Left on an east-bound train  
Gone first thing this morning  
Why is what's best for you  
Always the worst thing for me  
  
When am I gonna learn  
Why, 'cause I'm tired of hating  
When will it be your turn  
Why, 'cause I'm tired of waiting  
  
No, I don't  
No, I don't  
No, I don't  
  
Well, no, I don't find faith in your false feelings  
Not fooled by your misleadings  
Won't buy this line you're selling  
Tired of this lie you're telling  
  
I won't  
But I don't  
But I won't do this anymore  
I won't  
I don't  
But I won't do this anymore, whoa  
Whoa-oh, oh  
  
She says I'm only telling half of it  
That's probably 'cause there's only half worth telling  
And every time I try to laugh it off  
That's when you turn around, wind up yelling  
  
When am I gonna learn  
Why, 'cause I'm tired of hating  
When will it be your turn  
Why, 'cause I'm tired of waiting  
  
No, I don't  
No, I don't  
No, I don't  
  
No, I don't find faith in your false feelings  
Not fooled by your misleadings  
Won't buy this line you're selling  
Tired of this lie you're telling  
  
I won't  
But I don't  
But I won't do this anymore  
I won't  
I don't  
But I won't do this anymore, whoa  
Whoa-oh, oh  
Yeah-ah, yeah  
  
She says I'm only telling half of it  
That's probably 'cause there's only half worth telling  
And every time I try to laugh it off  
That's when you turn around, wind up yelling
