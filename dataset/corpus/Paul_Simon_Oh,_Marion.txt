The boy's got brains  
He just don't use 'em that's all  
The boy's got brains  
He just refuse to use 'em and that's all  
He said "the more I got to thinkin  
The less I tend to laugh"  
The boy's got brains  
He just abstains  
The boy's got a heart  
But it beats on the opposite side  
It's a strange phenomenon  
The laws of nature defied  
He said "its a chance I had to take  
So I shifted my heart for it's safety sake"  
The boy's got a heart but it beats on  
His opposite side  
Oh, marion,  
I think I'm in trouble here  
I should have believed you  
When I heard you saying it  
The only time  
That love is an easy game  
Is when two other people  
Are playing it  
The boy's got a voice  
But the voice is his natural disguise  
Yes the boy's got a voice  
But his words don't connect to his eyes  
He says "oh, but when I sing  
I can hear the truth auditioning".  
The boy's got a voice  
But the voice is natural
