One night, one empty room  
One man getting over you  
One star, one lonely moon  
I make a wish I know will never come true  
  
You'll call my name  
And you'll beg me to hold you again  
But the truth remains  
And I'm only a fool who can't help but pretend  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all over, but I'm holding on  
I can't let go till the love is gone  
It's all over, but I keep holding on  
With a desperate heart  
My desperate heart  
  
Some nights I try in my mind  
To see myself loving someone new  
Still I know I'm wasting my time  
No one can ever take the place of you  
  
So I close my eyes  
I swear I feel you here by my side  
Bet it's all, it's only a lie  
That I need to believe for my heart to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All this time I've been drowning in hopeless illusion  
I've been keeping inside  
That someday you'll walk out of the shadows  
And back into my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't believe your love for me is gone
