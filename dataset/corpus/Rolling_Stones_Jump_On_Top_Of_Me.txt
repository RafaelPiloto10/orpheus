I've been working so hard, And feelin' no  
Pain  
Sure got pains in my head, My legs feel  
Limp  
Don't want to hear no noise, Don't want to  
Hear you cuss  
I need peace of mind, Don't you make no  
Fuss  
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of  
Me baby  
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice  
And slow  
Well there's too much talkin', 'bout this an'  
That  
And the window needs fixin', Better feed  
The cat  
We're fresh out of beer, Could you answer  
The phone  
Well you call this bisque, Well I'm leavin'  
Home  
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of  
Me baby  
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice  
And slow  
Alright  
Well jump on top of me baby, Jump on  
Top of me baby  
Get on top of me girl, Everybody lay down  
Low  
When we first met, We were both so  
Young  
We didn't give a damn, How the clock  
Would run  
The time is right, To make some fool of  
You  
'cause it's gettin' late, What would you like  
To do  
Jump on top of me baby, Get on top of me  
Baby  
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice  
And slow  
Alright  
Well  
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of  
Me baby  
Jump on top of me girl, And give it to me  
Nice and slow  
Alright  
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of  
Me baby  
Jump on top of me girl, Everybody lay  
Down low  
Alright  
Jump on top of me baby, Yeah top of me  
Baby  
On top of me girl, Everybody lay down  
Low  
I can't stand it, When the sun comes up  
Gonna need some comfort, 'Cause I can't  
Stand up  
Shut the blinds, I'm gonna shut the shades  
And tell the neighbors, We'll be gone for  
Days  
Jump on top of me baby, Jump on top of  
Me baby  
Jump on top of me girl, Give it to me nice  
And slow  
Alright
