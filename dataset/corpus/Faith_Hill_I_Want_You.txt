The eagle wants a canyon  
And a place where he can rest  
His wings a while.  
The drifter wants a freight train  
  
That will carry him another hundred miles.  
That lion's only looking for something'  
He can sink his teeth into.  
Oh and I want you.  
  
The devil wants a fella  
With a weakness he can wrap  
His arms around.  
The champion wants a challenger  
  
Who just might have the strength to  
Take him down.  
The river wants an ocean to run towards  
And pour its heart into.  
  
Oh and I want you.  
Oh and I want you.  
Oh, every time that I'm around you  
Oh, I'm on fire when we touch.  
  
Oh, when I hold you boy you know  
I can't get close enough.  
Yes I want you.  
I could cry and say I need you  
  
Tell you that I die when you're not here  
I could lie and say I love you  
Pour a little poison in your ear  
But all I'm gonna give you is  
  
Nothing but the bare and naked truth.  
Baby I want you.  
Baby I want you.
