Would you like to live in Houston  
Where the cowboys come to town  
Or maybe Pensacola  
Where the sun shines all year ?round  
Or even New York City  
Where the city never sleeps  
I'm offering you the option  
Before you get in too deep  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby, be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place, have a good life  
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else, do it  
But if you can't  
Baby, you can stay right here  
  
There's work up in Seattle  
If you don't mind the rain  
San Diego to Savannah  
They'd all be glad you came  
But life with me would always be  
A roller coaster ride  
You won't hurt my feelings  
Whatever you decide  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby, be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place, have a good life  
Don't worry ?bout me, I'm gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else, do it  
But if you can't  
Baby, you can stay right here  
  
This place might look real good right now  
But looking good don't last  
But if you choose it, anyhow  
I'll give you all I have (but)  
  
If you can do anything else
