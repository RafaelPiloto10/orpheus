Where my dreams are all too clear  
Darkness, darkness  
Filled with all the sounds of fear  
I hear voices (don't turn out the light)  
Calling faraway  
I see shadows (don't turn out the light)  
Moving, changing shape  
And the clock stops  
As darkness closes in  
I hesitate but it's too late  
I scream and scream again  
I hear colours black and red  
I see sounds that fill my head  
I'll never read those books again  
In darkness  
Where my dreams are all too clear  
Darkness, darkness  
Filled with all the sounds of fear  
I hear voices (don't turn out the light)  
Calling faraway  
I see shadows (don't turn out the light)  
Moving, changing shape  
Don't turn out the light (don't turn out the light)  
Or I'll go over the edge  
Don't turn out the light (don't turn out the light)  
Or I'll go over the edge  
In darkness  
Where my dreams are all too clear  
Darkness, darkness  
Filled with all the sounds of fear  
I hear voices (don't turn out the light)  
Calling faraway  
I see shadows (don't turn out the light)  
Moving, changing shape  
I hear voices (don't turn out the light)  
Calling faraway  
I see shadows (don't turn out the light)  
Moving, changing shape
