I'm drained but aching for more  
And the devil inside is reading  
The words of the saddest poem  
To be engraved on the stone of my grave  
  
I'd kill to share your pain  
(And carry the shame)  
And sell my soul for you just to say  
  
I dream what you're dreaming  
And feel what you're feeling  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
Nothing will be enough  
For the ones Who keep on stumbling  
In the garden of withering trust  
Without the courage to leave  
  
Oh I'd take my life for your kiss  
(Grant me my wish)  
And lose it all to take you across the abyss  
  
I dream what you're dreaming  
And feel what you're feeling  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
You dream what I'm Dreaming  
And See what I'm seeing  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the Face of God  
  
Labyrinth in a shape of a heart  
Love's secret architecture  
I find myself to be lost in the  
Arms of your fate  
  
I'd kill to share you pain  
(Please let me stay)  
And sell my soul for you just to say  
Love's name in vein  
Again and again  
  
I dream what you're dreaming  
And feel what you're feeling  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
You dream what I'm Dreaming  
And See what I'm seeing  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of  
(Face of)  
The face of  
(Face of)  
God  
  
(Face of)  
God
