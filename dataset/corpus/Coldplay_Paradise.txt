When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach  
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of  
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise  
Every time she closed her eyes  
  
When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth  
Life goes on, it gets so heavy  
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall  
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes  
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly  
  
And dream of para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)  
  
She'd dream of para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)  
  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
And so lying underneath those stormy skies  
She'd say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I know the sun must set to rise"  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
