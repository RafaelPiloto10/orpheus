Throw down the sword,  
The fight is done and over,  
Neither lost, neither won.  
To cast away the fury of the battle  
And turn my weary eyes for home.  
  
There were times when I stood at death's own door  
Only hoping for an answer.  
  
Throw down the sword,  
And leave the glory  
A story time can never change.  
To walk the road, the load I have to carry  
A journey's end, a wounded soul.  
  
There were times when I stood at death's own door  
Only searching for an answer.
