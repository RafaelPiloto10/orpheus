Another day, another small town  
A summer breeze  
The bougainvillea is still in bloom  
His room  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
The morning comes, they take their showers  
They go to work, they do their hours  
It's a routine  
They lean on.  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
His books are on the shelf (It doesn't matter what we do  
Craving curious finger it will never leave us  
His favorite after-shave time that used to pass  
Has now stopped)  
Lingers still....  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
The evening news, they hear them saying  
Tonight's the game, his team is playing  
They go to bed  
Instead.  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
Out in the quiet street  
One stray dog is crying  
And if their eyes don't meet  
All is well.
