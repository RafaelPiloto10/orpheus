Long time ago in Bethlehem,  
So the Holy Bible say,  
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,  
Was born on Christmas day,  
Hark, now hear the angels sing,  
A newborn King today,  
And man will live forevermore,  
Because of Christmas day.  
Trumpets sound and angels sing,  
Listen to what they say,  
That Man will live forevermore,  
Because of Christmas day.  
  
(Verse 1)  
While shepherds watched their flocks by night,  
They saw a bright new shining star,  
They heard a choir sing,  
The music seemed to come from afar,  
  
(Verse 2)  
Now, Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Come to bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
(Verse 3)  
By and by, they find a little nook,  
In a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark,  
Mary's litlle Boy was born!
