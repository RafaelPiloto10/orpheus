With fire to keep us warm  
And tools we made from rocks and bones  
A roof over your head  
And walls to keep you safe in bed  
  
There must be more than this  
So god was born and we in his  
Image of fear and love  
Looked down upon from up above  
  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe if we wanna see the world change  
  
We crossed the oceans wide  
Built cities to the sky (oh lord)  
Looked up and we were flying  
But will we not survive ourselves  
  
We gotta do much more than believe if wanna see the world change  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe, go on try it, go on try it  
We gotta do much more than believe if we wanna see the world change  
  
What will I say to baby?  
Let me show you a movie  
You know we landed a man on the moon?  
Now you could never believe it  
Yea we could do anything  
We flew to the stars and back  
Down to the ground hard  
  
Please wake up  
Please wake up  
Please wake up  
  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe, go on try it, go on try it  
We gotta do much more than believe if we really wanna change things  
We gotta do much more than believe, go on try it, go on try it  
We gotta do much more than believe if we wanna see the world change  
  
Oh, my little baby  
I'll show you this movie  
You know we landed a man on the moon?  
  
I know its hard to imagine  
But we could do anything  
Under the stars
