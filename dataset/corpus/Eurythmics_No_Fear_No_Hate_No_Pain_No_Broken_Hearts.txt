Well in the morning  
When our day begins  
And it feels like cold cold steel  
And when the sun comes up  
It's like a new commotion  
You say nobody told you  
It would feel like this  
  
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts  
  
You've got the killing gun  
Held in your hand  
It feels like cold cold steel  
And when the sun comes up  
It's like a new commotion  
You say shoot shoot shoot it up  
Shoot it up
