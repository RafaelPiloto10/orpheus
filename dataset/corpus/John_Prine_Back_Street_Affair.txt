You didn't know I wasn't free  
When you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart you learned to care  
It brought you shame and disgrace  
The world has tumbled in your face  
'Cause they call our love a back street affair  
  
They say I wrecked your home,  
You're a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow that we had to bear  
For the one I'm tied to  
Was the first to prove untrue  
Now they call our love a back street affair  
  
We have each other now,  
That's all that matters anyhow  
For the judgment of gossip's never fair  
We'll just be brave and strong  
Then someday they'll see they're wrong  
Let 'em call our love a back street affair  
  
We'll be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for then we'll share  
We'll climb a mountain high,  
Then the world will hear us cry  
That our love was not a back street affair  
No, our love was not a back street affair
