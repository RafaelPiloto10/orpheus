Little girl is smart as she can be, woe  
Little girl you've made a fool of me, woe.  
I believed her when she said she really loved me.  
The love was shining in my eyes so couldn't see the lies  
In her eyes.  
  
Little girl knows more than she pretends  
She knew I wanted to be more than friends.  
Every time she hurt me oh how sorry she was,  
Yesterday she went to far and now I'm through because I'm wise  
To all those lies.  
  
Friends said don't worry now she's sweet and she's kind  
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel all the time  
The little things that bothered me I let them go by  
And now it's too late to cry.  
  
Little girl it's time that we should part  
'Cause little girl now you've broke my heart.  
I couldn't help but hear what they had said about you  
Now I'm ashamed to tell them that I fell in love you.  
They'd laugh at me  
Please set me free.  
  
Friends said don't worry now she's sweet and she's kind  
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel all the time.  
The little things that bothered me I let them go by  
And now it's too late to cry.  
  
Little girl now I'm through with you  
'Cause you've got everything you wanted too.  
Despite all those things that they said you had done  
You had me believin' now that I was the one  
In your dreams, instead of your schemes.  
  
Little girl, little girl
