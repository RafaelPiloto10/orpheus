I've got the question  
I've had it for days  
You've got the answer, dear  
I'll put the question  
In one little phrase  
Say what I want to hear  
  
Who do you love I hope  
Who would you kiss I hope  
Who is it going to be  
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me  
  
Who do you want I hope  
Who do you need I hope  
Who is it going to be  
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me  
  
Is it the baker who gave you a cake  
I saw that look in his eye  
Is it the butcher who brought you a steak  
Say that it is and I'll die  
  
Who do you love I hope  
Who would you kiss I hope  
Who is it going to be  
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

I heard your question  
The answer you know  
Love is my middle name  
You asked a question  
That worried you so  
Mind if I do the same  
  
Who do you love I hope  
Who would you kiss I hope  
Who is it going to be  
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me  
  
Who do you want I hope  
Who do you need I hope  
Who is it going to be  
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me  
  
Is it the blondie who acted so shy  
I heard the things that she said  
Is it the redhead who gave you the eye  
Say that it is and your dead  
  
Who do you love I hope  
Who would you kiss I hope  
Who is it going to be  
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me
