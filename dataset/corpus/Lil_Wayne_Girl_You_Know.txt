[Lil Wayne]  
Uhh, she got that good good,  
She Michael Jackson Bad,  
I'm attracted to her,  
With her attractive ass,  
You get her the matching bags,  
I get her to pack them bags,  
Get straight in that taxi cab,  
Come straight to my bachelor pad,  
I hate to see her go,  
But I love to watch her leave,  
I keep her comin' back,  
Like she forgot her keys,  
And now we're murderers,  
Because we kill time,  
She saw doctor carter and now she feel fine,  
  
[Gudda Gudda]  
I like the way you walking if you walking my way,  
I'm that red bull now lets fly away,  
Lets buy a place,  
With all kinds of space,  
I'll let you be the judge,  
And and I'm the case,  
I'm gudda gudda,  
I putta other,  
I see me with her  
No stevie wonder,  
She don't even wonder,  
Cos she know she bad,  
And I got her n-gga, grocery bags,  
  
[Omarion - Chorus]  
Look, look at you (at you)  
Bad, yes you are,  
She roll with us,  
Look at how she walks,  
I like the way you talk,  
Damn you know it, damn you know it,  
And she know it and she know it,  
Your so, You know,  
Your so, you know,  
  
[Nicki Minaj]  
Ok I get it, let me think,  
I guess it's my turn,  
Maybe it's time to put this p-ssy on your sideburns,  
You say I'm bad, you probably right,  
He pressing me like button downs on a friday night,  
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike,  
Be on my low scrunch,  
Be on my egg and whites,  
You say Nicki don't stop you the bestest,  
And I just be coming off the top asbestos,  
  
[Drake]  
I love your sushi roll,  
Hotter than Wasabi,  
I race for your love,  
Shake and bake ricky bobby,  
I'm at the W but I can't meet you at the lobby,  
Girl I gotta watch my back cos I'm not just anybody,  
I see em stand in line just to get beside her,  
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest surprise her,  
Cos when we disappear, you need gps to find her,  
Oh that was you girl,  
I thought I recognised her,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tyga]  
She like tanning,  
I like staying in,  
She like romancing,  
I like rollin with friends,  
She said I'm caged in,  
I think her conscious is,  
She watching them dat oxygen,  
I'm watching espn,  
But when the shows ends she all in my skin,  
Lotions, no emotions, rollarcoasting like back forth,  
Hold it (hold it, hold it, hold it)  
She pose like it's for posters,  
And I poke like I'm supposed to,  
Take this photo if you for me,  
Don't you ever show this,  
I'm too loyal, and too focused  
To be losing and be hopeless,  
When I spoke this she rejoiced it,  
Tell your words, get me open,  
So I closed it, where your clothes is?  
I'm only lovin for the moment.  
  
[Jae Millz]  
She aint got a man, but she is not alone,  
Miss Independent, yeah she got her own,  
Hey gorgeous uh I mean flawless,  
Well that's what you are, how I see it,  
Is how I call it, yeh  
Look at how she walk,  
Who knew she know she bad  
Do your thing baby, I aint even mad,  
And I aint leaving fast,  
Imma stay a while,  
Hold your head chris,  
Imma take it down
