Georgia, you know that you've been on my mind  
Georgia, we both learned to compromise  
I'll be there for you  
When everybody's coming unglued  
I'll be there for you  
I won't say you have to choose  
I don't want to let you go  
And I don't want to lose you slowly  
I just want to let you know  
That it's only just a little back and forth lately  
Georgia, I'll be chasing you the rest of my life  
Georgia, welcome to the roller coaster ride  
When I come to you  
I know that you'll help get through  
I'll be there for you  
We both know we could never choose  
I don't want to let you go  
And I don't want to lose you slowly  
I just want to let you know  
That it's only just a little back and forth  
It's only just a little back and forth lately  
You carry it like a heavyweight champ  
It's hard to say I can't but I know I can't be right there standing  
I don't want to let you go  
And I don't want to lose you slowly  
I just want to let you know  
That it's only just a little back and forth lately  
I could never let go  
After all that you've been to me  
I just want to let you know  
That's it's only just a little back and forth  
It's only just a little back and forth lately  
A little back and forth lately  
A little back and forth
