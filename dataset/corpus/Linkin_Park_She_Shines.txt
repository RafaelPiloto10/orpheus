She shines like a flower  
In my head  
Everybody,  
Wants to pick her head  
  
[Chorus:]  
She said she loved me  
And lied to me  
She was by the river  
And lied to me  
  
She shines like a flower  
In my head  
Everybody,  
Wants her in their bed  
  
[Chorus:]  
She said she loved you  
And lied to you  
She was by the river  
And lied to you  
  
So eager  
So eager  
So eager  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So eager7x  
  
So eager 3x  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So eager 6x
