Isn't it strange? Feels like I'm lookin' in the mirror  
What would people say if only they knew that I was  
Part of some geneticist's plan  
Born to be a carbon copy man  
There in a petri dish late one night  
They took a donor's body cell and fertilized a human egg and so I say  
  
I think I'm a clone now  
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down  
  
Look at the way we go out walking close together  
I guess you could say I'm really beside myself  
I still remember how it began  
They produced a carbon copy man  
Born in a science lab late one night  
Without a mother or a father  
Just a test tube and a womb with a view  
  
I think I'm a clone now  
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down  
I think I'm a clone now  
And I can stay at home while I'm out of town  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every pair of genes is a hand-me-down  
  
Signing autographs for my fans  
Come and meet the carbon copy man  
Livin' in stereo, it's all right  
Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza, so I say  
  
I think I'm a clone now  
Another one of me's always hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down  
I think I'm a clone now  
I've been on Oprah Winfrey, I'm world renowned  
I think I'm a clone now  
And every pair of genes is a hand-me-down  
I think I'm a clone now  
Thats my genetic twin always hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down
