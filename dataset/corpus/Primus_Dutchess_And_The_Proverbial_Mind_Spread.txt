"burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind  
  
Swimming  
I see myself a-treadin' water  
I see no signs of any other people  
There's a heron up above me  
I lay back and spread my mind  
  
Dutchess  
She used to be a movie maker  
She used like to watch the boys watch her  
And she saved enough money  
To go to cal and spread her mind  
  
Billy  
Used to follow the dead with arnie  
And they made a hundred thousand dollars  
But ended up in federal prison  
Twenty years for spreading minds  
  
Burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind  
  
Burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind  
  
Burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind  
  
Burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind  
  
Burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind  
  
Burning  
I feel a burning in my stomach  
I wanna know if I'm a-gonna make it  
If I don't just spread my ashes  
If I do just spread your mind"
