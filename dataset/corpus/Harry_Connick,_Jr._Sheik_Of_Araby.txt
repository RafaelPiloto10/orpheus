Well, I'm the Sheik of Araby and your love, well, it belongs to me  
At night when you're asleep, into your tent I'll creep  
And the stars that shine above, they'll light our way to love  
You'll rule this land with me, I'm the Sheik of Araby, baby  
  
I'm a Sheik, not the freak but the Sheik of Araby  
And your love belongs to me  
At night when you're asleep, into baby, your tent I'll creep  
And the stars that shine above, they'll light our way to love  
You'll rule this land with me, I'm a Sheik, not the freak  
  
Oh, I'm the Sheik of Araby, and your love belongs to me  
At night when you're asleep, baby, into your tent I'll creep  
And the stars that shine above, they'll light our way to love  
You'll rule this land with me, I'm the Sheik of Araby
