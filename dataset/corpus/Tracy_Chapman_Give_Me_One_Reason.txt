Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Said I don't want leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
  
Baby I got your number and I know that you got mine  
But you know that I called you, I called too many times  
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime  
You got to call me  
  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Because I don't want leave you lonely

I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life  
I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life  
I just want someone to hold me and rock me through the night  
  
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need  
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need  
But I'm too old to go chasing you around  
Wasting my precious energy  
  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Give me one reason to stay here  
And I'll turn right back around  
Because I don't want leave you lonely  
You got to make me change my mind  
  
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one reason why  
Baby just give me one reason, Give me just one reason why I should stay  
Said I told you that I loved you  
And there ain't no more to say
