Hey, you, who are you talkin' to  
Hey, boy, haven't you heard the news  
No one can fight more than these boys  
No one can bite more than these boys  
  
Hey, hose, who do you want to know  
Hey, punk, get off my case and go  
No one can fix more than these boys  
No one can kick more than these boys  
  
The boys in the band  
  
You can back down  
Yours is no disgrace  
No slack clown  
It's time to close your face  
  
Hey, now, what have you got that's new  
Come on boy what are you trying to prove  
No one can take more than these boys  
'Cause no one can shake more than these boys  
  
The boys in the band  
  
You can break down  
Yours is no disgrace  
No slack clown  
It's time that you knew your place  
  
Come on break down  
'Cause yours is no disgrace  
No slack clown  
It's time to close your face
