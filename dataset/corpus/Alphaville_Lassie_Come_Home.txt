lonely boy  
gazing on the afternoon  
people drifting cross the surface of the twilight day  
there's a little yellow man  
standing by the railway station  
painting portraits on the brickwalls  
of billie holloway  
lovely lady smile,  
dance, my dear,  
i'm only operating on lassie come home  
this was authentic you, she spoke,  
this was authentic you who blew me cold  
she had no chance to realize,  
it hit her straight between the eyes,  
so i've been told  
in the park, she's giving out some photographs  
on which she's giving out some photos of what she hands around  
they videoed a ghost tonite,  
she said before i turned it off  
it rode an orange paper bike  
and left without a sound  
keep on riding, sir, open up the door  
and shout it out  
lassie come home, come home  
this was authentic you, she spoke,  
this was authentic you who blew, who blew me cold  
i had no chance to realize,  
it hit her straight between the eyes,  
so i've been told  
lonely girl  
dancing in a music hall  
lightning struck her silver starship  
and turned it into stone  
and now she's falling all the time  
into that void beyond her grey eyes  
somewhere a telephone is ringing  
but nobody's at home  
hello, junkie sweetheart  
listen now, this is your captain calling  
your captain is dead  
keep on riding, sir, open up the door  
and shout it out, shout it out,  
shout it out  
shout it out  
lassie come home  
this is your captain calling  
we're falling all the time  
all the time  
lassie come home
