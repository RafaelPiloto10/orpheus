Down in Larissa's lagoon  
She sits by the light of the moon  
She's hearing voices in her head  
She must be strong  
She must not give in to their song  
She's hearing voices in her head  
  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
Her guests, they sleep in separate rooms  
But her father comes to tuck her into bed  
She's lost her mind  
Got no control  
And there's nowhere else to go  
When her father comes to tuck her into bed  
  
[Chrous:]  
But Larissa woke up one morning singing,  
"Hallelujah, remember me for my passion,  
The paradise that I imagined, hallelujah."  
  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
The skies, they never look blue  
'Cause someone spiked the rain  
With a little extra juice  
She thinks she's being followed  
Any minute she'll be swallowed  
Someone spiked this rain  
With a little extra juice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah  
Down in Larissa's lagoon  
There is no force that's greater  
Looming deep within a very, very, very troubled girl  
She stays awake for hours  
Picking out the sweetest flowers  
To lay upon the grave of a very, very troubled girl  
  
[Chorus]
