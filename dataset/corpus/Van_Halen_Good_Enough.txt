U.S. prime, grade A stamped guaranteed  
Just grease it up and bring on the heat  
Throw it down and roll it over once or twice  
Then chow down  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's good enough, good enough to huh!  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
She's good enough to huh!  
  
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite  
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs  
I like to open up with a little six on the half shell  
Then it's three-six-nine times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey waitress you got any specials here tonight  
Me and the fellas might be interested in  
Rack a what  
Well I'll have some of that  
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world  
Cause I'm two days gone and I just can't see  
But I ain't no fool and honey I know a good thing  
And she's comin' she's comin'  
So come on, come on, come on cause she's  
Good, good, good enough  
Good, good, good enough  
Good, good, good enough  
Good, good, good enough ohhh!
