Hey, go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns go drifting by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Well, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
Hey, and your hair is turning gray  
Hey, lift your head and smile at trouble  
Hey, you'll find peace and rest some day  
  
Now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
My, don't you worry about tomorrow  
Just let tomorrow come and go  
'Cause tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Hey, safe from all that wind and snow  
  
Now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Hey, I know police they cause you trouble  
Hey, they cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You'll find no policemen there  
  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Hey, now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Well, that's a hobo's lullaby
