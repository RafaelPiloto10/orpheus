Verse 1:  
Don't Need Ya Name Girl  
Don't Need Your Number  
This Might Seem Strange But  
Can't Help But Wonder  
What It Would Feel Like  
Just To Be With You  
Don't Need To Move Fast  
Just Wanna Take You Through  
How You Hold Me  
And What You Told Me  
Girl You Don't Even Know Me  
Bae Whatcha Tryna Do  
Every Time I'm Looking In Your Eyes  
Got Me Thinking Boutcha  
Wanna Take You Home  
Where You Can Be Alone Tonight  
Tell Me What You Want  
I Wanna Find Out Whatcha Like  
  
Chorus:  
You Make Me Say Oooooooh  
  
Just Wanna Love Youuuuuu  
Don't Know What You Dooooo  
Just Looking At Youuu  
You Make Me Say Ooooooh  
Just Wanna Love Youuuuu  
Don't Know What You Dooooo  
Just Looking At Youuuuu  
  
Verse 2:  
I Love The Way You Move  
We're On The Right Track  
Don't Be A Stranger  
Girl Bring That ass Back

And I Aint Tryna Take His Place  
You Thinkin Bout Leavin With Me  
It's Written On Your Face
