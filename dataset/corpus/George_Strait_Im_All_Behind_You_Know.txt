Leavin' me behind is all behind you now  
It's plain to see that you're for good over me  
You've gotta whole new life ahead of you  
You did what you lived to do  
And I'm all behind you now  
  
And I'll be behind you always  
Should you every be a yesterday  
Though it tears me up  
To know deep down  
I'm all behind you know  
  
You're comin' back  
My way will come my way again  
I'll never be what I was with you and me  
And I don't know who or where your goin' to  
But you did what you lived to do  
And I'm all behind you now  
  
And I'll be behind you always  
Should you every be a yesterday  
Though it tears me up  
To know deep down  
I'm all behind you know  
  
Yeah it tears me up to know deep down  
I'm all behind you know
