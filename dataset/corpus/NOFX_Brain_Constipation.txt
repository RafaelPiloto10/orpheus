Somebody hear me, somebody listen to me  
Am I alone in this world  
Is there anyone listening?  
Appease me, can't find a reason to be  
Alienation, is taking over me  
  
I'm going away, can't go on any longer  
I really don't know why I just gotta die  
I never thought this was how it would end  
  
The body swinging  
I see it over and over again  
Vanian singing, can I ever listen to it again?  
A cry for attention was a cry I never heard  
  
With no one listening,  
There was nothing to be heard  
Nothing to be heard
