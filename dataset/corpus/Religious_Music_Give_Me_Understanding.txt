Give me understanding, Lord  
That I might follow  
Teach me from Your Word  
So that my heart be true.  
  
Guide me in the path of righteousness  
O Father!  
Turn my heart to You  
Turn my heart to You!  
  
Thy Word is very good  
Thy Word is very good  
O Lord! How I long for You!  
  
Thy Word is very good  
Thy Word is very good  
O Lord! How I long for You!  
  
O Lord! How I long for You, and Your Word!  
  
Turn my eyes from vanities  
Preserve my life, Lord  
Be with me so all may see  
Your love, and fear!  
  
Turn away my troubles  
Let my life be witness  
That my God is near  
That my God is here!
