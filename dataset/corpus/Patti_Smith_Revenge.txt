I feel upset.  
Let's do some celebrating.  
Come on honey, don't hesitate now.  
Needed you, you withdrew, I was so forsaken.  
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move.  
I believe I'll be taking my revenge.  
Sweet revenge.  
I thought you were some perfect read-out.  
Some d-digital delay had obscured  
And phased my view of the wicked hand you played.  
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out, run out, ah you better face it.  
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck  
I do know how to replace it with revenge.  
Oh, sweet revenge.  
I gave you a wristwatch, baby.  
You wouldn't even give me the time of day.  
You want to know what makes me tick.  
Now it's me that's got precious little to say.  
For the ghosts of our love have dried have died.  
There's no use faking it.  
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight.  
High time I was taking my revenge.  
Sweet revenge.  
Revenge. Revenge.  
all the gold and silver couldn't measure up my love for you. it's so
immaterial. I don't wait around for you. [ ] [ ] nobody gets anything. nobody
gets nothing. no [ ] don't leave me no space in your little boat you ain't
gonna need no you ain't gonna need no little boat you are living on my time my
dear.  
Revenge. Sweet revenge. Sweet sweet revenge. . .
