He was the kinda guy  
I liked the way he looked.  
He had a red silk tie,  
He had a forties suit.  
  
And I said, "You're the kind of person  
I've been longing to adore."  
"You're the kind of person  
I've been waiting for."  
  
He said, "The time is right to take a chance  
'Cause I'm looking for a brand new romance."  
"So come on baby let's go outside -  
I've got a car in the drive and we can take a ride."  
"So let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo."  
"Let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo."  
  
Well, we went driving for an hour or so  
Till we took the little Chevy down to Mexico.  
And I said, "Blue eyed boy, you know I love the way you look."  
  
"Why don't we find a preacher  
Who can get us hooked?"  
"You know the time is right to take a chance  
'Cause I'm looking for a brand new romance."  
And the great big moon  
Was a shinin' down  
He said "Forget about the preacher man,  
Let's do it on the ground!"  
  
"Let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo."  
"Let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo."
