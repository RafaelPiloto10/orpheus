When she walked into the room  
I felt her move me  
I saw her eyes  
They went right through me  
Just one look I was forever in blue  
  
In a spell of her embrace  
Just for a moment  
I was the one, caught in the moment  
I knew, yes, right then I knew  
  
Two hearts, reach for each other  
Once chance, she's like no other  
I'm lost, lost in the dream of you  
'Cause it's true oh  
I'm forever, forever in blue  
  
In a fantasy of my anticipation  
I knew there was no consolation  
I knew, oh I knew  
  
And on the night she told me that  
She had another  
I was broken by the truth  
I discovered, I knew oh I knew  
  
Two hearts, reach for each other  
Once chance, she's like no other  
I'm lost, lost in the dream of you  
'Cause it's true oh  
I'm forever, forever in blue... in blue  
  
Believe me girl, I tried not to call  
But here I am once again, yes once again  
Beside you, with my hands on the wall  
  
Two hearts, reach for each other  
Once chance, she's like no other  
I'm lost, lost in the dream of you  
Those two hearts, reach for each other  
Once chance, she's like no other  
I'm lost, lost in the dream of you  
'Cause it's true oh  
I'm forever, forever in blue
