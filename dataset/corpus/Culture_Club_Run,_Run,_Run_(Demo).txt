You'd better run  
  
I don't know anyone as cold as you, baby  
Except those fools that cuss me on the street  
They don't bring me down the way that you do  
Steal my heart and take away my sleep  
  
So you better run, run, run  
If you're getting ready for a life of crime  
You better run, run, run  
If you're thinking maybe you can waste my time  
  
You better run  
You better run  
You better run  
  
I don't know anyone as fine as you, boy  
Your lying eyes, your lips, your hands and feet, so sweet  
No one brings me down the way that you do  
Steal my heart and take away my sleep  
  
So you better run, run, run  
If you're getting ready for a life of crime  
You better run, run, run  
If you're thinking maybe you can waste my time  
  
You better run  
You better run  
You better run  
You better run  
  
I don't know anyone as cold as you, baby  
No one brings me down the way that you do  
Steal my heart and take away my sleep  
  
So you better run, run, run  
If you're getting ready for a life of crime  
You better run, run, run  
If you're thinking maybe you can waste my time  
You better run, run, run  
If you're getting ready for a life of crime  
  
You better run  
You better run  
You better run  
You better run  
You better run
