"I need you." is all that I can say  
But deep inside of me you know  
I want you more each day  
But time won't let me have the chance  
So, I've got to see you even at a glance  
  
I know it's hard for you to see  
Exactly how much you mean to me  
Since it's just a one way street  
And I'm the only who's on it  
No one knows the way but me  
  
"I love you..." can't you hear me?  
Oh, can't you please see through me  
Oh, babe I need your love so badly  
It's no lie so please believe me  
In my heart you'll see the real me  
You just gotta give me a chance  
  
Since I got that off my chest  
I need to let you know is  
I really did my best  
To keep this feeling inside  
But there's just no place to hide  
So, please be my love  
  
"I love you..." can't you hear me?  
Oh, can't you please see through me  
Oh, babe I need your love so badly  
It's no lie so please believe me  
In my heart you'll see the real me  
You just gotta give me a chance  
  
Give me a chance  
Give me a chance  
Give me a chance  
Give me a chance
