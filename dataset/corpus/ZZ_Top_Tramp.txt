Tramp  
You could call me that  
I don't wear continental clothes  
Stetson hats, sometimes  
?  
Momma would. Papa too.  
I love this child. It is all I know how to do  
  
Heh. Call me country  
Right from the words.  
I'll answer when you call me.  
'Cause baby, if that makes you feel good  
Hm.  
?  
Momma would. Papa too.  
I love this child. It is all I know how to do  
  
Ha. Now whatever you call me,  
Ha ha, I'll even go for that.  
'Cause I keep a big, fat bank roll in my pocket, baby  
And I'm personal friends with the dealer who owns all the dealerships of all
the Cadillacs.  
Ha ha!  
?  
Ow!  
Ma would. Papa too.  
I love this child. It is all I know how to do  
Come on child, let's play it  
?
