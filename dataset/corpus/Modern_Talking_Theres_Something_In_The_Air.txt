I know, I know, your love  
Is like the ocean  
I know, for sure, your head is in the clouds, my love  
Oh I know, your love, is like a sweet devotion  
Baby, baby tell me, tell me, what's love is all about  
  
There's something in the air  
Oh be...be...baby, your love is so unfair  
Oh be...be...baby  
There's something in the air, something in the air  
Baby but your love is crazy, baby I don't care  
There's something in the air tonight  
  
Baby but your love will make it always right  
Baby there's something in the air tonight  
Oh I can feel it  
I know we make a night, we will remember, oh no  
I know we turn the night, in million days, my love  
I know for sure it like summer in December  
Baby, baby, nobody knows, where is the perfect way
