When I fell for you there was no doubt about it  
You were the best thing in my life to come along  
You and me we said we would last forever  
Something so right you just had to make so wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday baby  
You're gonna miss my love  
Someday  
You're gonna miss my love  
  
You played around ' you didn't care about my feelings  
You messed around ' trying to play me like a fool  
How could you look in my face and tell me that you love me  
How could you treat me so cold ' how could you lie so cruel  
  
I'm trying to give you something  
Everybody's out here looking for  
You just couldn't see  
The good things that I had to give you  
Now it's time for me to help you out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm tried to give you something  
Everybody's out here looking for  
You just couldn't see a good thing  
That I had for you baby  
When I tried to give it to you, baby  
Now its time for me to help you out the door  
(Someday)  
Why did you have to do me wrong  
All you did was just string my heart along  
You're gonna miss my love  
You don't care about the pain I feel inside  
You lied, you lied  
(Someday)  
You lied to me baby  
You're gonna miss my love  
I can't believe, I can't conceive it  
(Someday)  
Gotta help you out the door, baby  
You're gonna miss my love
