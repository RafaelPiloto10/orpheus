Please to bend down for the one called the Greenman  
He wants to make you his bride  
Please to bend down for the one called the Greenman  
Forever to him you're tied  
  
And you know for a million years he has been your lover  
He'll be a million more  
And you know for a million years he has been your lover  
Down through the skin to the core  
  
Heed the Greenman  
Heed the Greenman  
  
Please to dance round for the one called the Greenman  
He wants to make you his child  
Please to dance round for the one called the Greenman  
Dressed in the fruits of the wild  
  
And you know for a million years he has been your father  
He'll be a million more  
And you know for a million years he has been your father  
Run to his arms at the door  
  
Lay your head, lay your head, lay your head, lay your head on the Greenman  
Lay your head, lay your head with mine  
Lay your head, lay your head, lay your head, lay your head on the Greenman  
Build a bed out of oak and pine  
  
See the Greenman blow his kiss from high church wall  
And unknowing church will amplify his call
