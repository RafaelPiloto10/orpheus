Violent indecision, surge of mass religion  
Let me out of prison  
I'm just killing time  
Every time I turn around  
I start to hear familiar sound  
Counting down as time stands still  
Yes I think it's time to kill  
  
Time to kill  
  
All the mental anguish  
Speaks a common language  
I have yet to lavish a chance to walk away  
Every time I turn around  
I start to hear a familiar sound  
Counting down as time stands still  
Yes I think it's time to kill  
  
Unknowing, unseeing  
Revelations unfold before your eyes  
Relenting, repenting.  
No time to think or compromise  
Time falling, time calling  
Into a void and seal the past  
You're waiting, annihilating,  
Making it real, making it last  
Worn out compromises  
Must be out of rises  
See through all the lies  
We don't walk away  
Every time we turn around  
Start to hear that familiar sound  
New beginnings time stands still  
Yes I think it's time to kill.
