I don't care if the sun don't shine  
But it better or people will wonder  
And I couldn't care less if it never stopped rainin'  
'Cept the kids are afraid of the thunder  
[Chorus:]  
Say sour grapes  
You can laugh and stare  
Say sour grapes  
But I don't care  
I couldn't care less if I didn't have a friend  
'Cept people would say I was crazy  
And I wouldn't work 'cause I don't need money  
But the same folks would say I was lazy  
[Chorus]  
I couldn't care less if she never come back  
I was gonna leave her anyway  
And all the good times that we shared  
Don't mean a thing to day  
[Chorus]
