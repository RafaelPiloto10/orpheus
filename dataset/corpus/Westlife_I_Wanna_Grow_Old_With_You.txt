Another day without your smile  
Another day just passes by  
But now I know how much it means  
For you to stay right here with me  
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger  
But it hurts so bad I can't take it any longer  
  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna die lying in your arms  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna be looking in your eyes  
I wanna be there for you, sharing in everything you do  
I wanna grow old with you  
  
A thousand miles between us now  
It causes me to wonder how  
Our love tonight remains so strong  
It makes our risk right all along  
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger  
But it hurt so bad I can't take it any longer  
  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna die lying in your arms  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna be looking in your eyes  
I wanna be there for you, sharing in everything you do  
I wanna grow old with you  
  
Things can come and go  
I know but  
Baby I believe  
Something's burning strong between us  
Makes it clear to me  
  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna die lying in your arms  
I wanna grow old with you  
I wanna be looking in your eyes  
I wanna be there for you, sharing in everything you do  
I wanna grow old with you
