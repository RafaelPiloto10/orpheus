Some say that love isn't fair  
But they don't know you and me  
And when they tell me that love doesn't last alone  
That's when I look at you  
And it's alright just let me lead you  
  
[Chorus:]:  
  
It's ok if you close your eyes  
I'll be standing by your side  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
Your my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end(yeah)  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
That I can...  
  
Time cannot tear us apart  
Were stronger than yesterday  
And though we've traveled so far  
You're still close to me  
Love changes everything  
And know that it's alright  
Just let me lead you (let me lead you)  
(Yeah)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's ok if you close your eyes  
I'll be standing by your side  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
Your my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end (yeah)  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
  
Through the peaks and the valleys  
Your not alone  
And when the world's upside down you know I'm there  
And anytime I feel afraid that's when I look at you  
  
With the best that I can  
I will love you(will love you) the very best I can  
The best that I can  
With every breath I take  
From this moment till the very end  
I'm gonna love(gonna love you) the best that I can  
The best that I can  
  
It's ok if you close your eyes  
I'll be standing by your side  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
You're my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end (yeah)  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
  
I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
