Leavin town, I found a flower that I could deserve. Someone moves and  
Someones bound to get their feelings hurt. I'm loving you, you're out of  
Range. Wanted you, you're out of range. As I walked out into the world I  
Felt a sudden chill. I was bleeding pretty good unto a daffodil. I'm loving  
You, you're out of range. Wanted you, you're out of range. I don't want too  
Much more than, to be reborn in, the mornin. Reborn so I can feel ya. The  
Bonds of blue reveal ya. I feel ya. I have your number and I've dailed it up  
A hundred times. Burried there, your voice is cracking up across state  
Lines. I'm loving you, you're out of range. Wanted you, you're out of range.  
Skies of extacy were breaking while I do believe, tears of god were falling  
Down upon my swollen cheeks. I'm loving you, you're out of range. Wanted you,  
You're out of range. I don't want too much more than, to be reborn in, the  
Mornin. Reborn so I can feel ya. The bonds of blue reveal ya. I feel ya.  
And I know it hurts when it's taken away, I tell ya that I could be livin  
Today with you, always thought you okay. Watlz by the rain and it's all  
Gonna change. I don't want too much more than, to be reborn in, the mornin.  
Reborn so I can feel ya. The bonds of blue reveal ya. I feel ya. No sir,  
Not too much more than, to be reborn in, the mornin. Reborn so I can feel  
Ya. The bonds of blue reveal ya. I feel ya.
