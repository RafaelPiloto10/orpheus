Beth I hear you calling  
But I can't come home right now  
Me and the boys are playing  
And we just can't find the sound  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
You say you feel so empty  
That our house just ain't our home  
I'm always somewhere else  
And you're always there alone  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
Beth I know you're lonely  
And I hope you'll be alright  
Cause me and the boys will be playing all night
