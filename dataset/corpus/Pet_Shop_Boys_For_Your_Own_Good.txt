For your own good  
Call me tonight  
Don't you think you should  
Call me tonight?  
Life isn't easy  
So why don't you stay  
With the lover you need  
And not the devil you pay?  
For your own good  
Call me tonight  
  
For your own good  
Call me tonight  
Don't you think I could  
Make a difference tonight?  
When you need a lover  
And it's so cold outside  
I could help you recover  
From pain that you hide  
Life isn't easy  
So why don't you stay  
With the lover you need  
And not the devil you pay?  
For your own good  
Call me tonight  
  
Come on, call me  
  
Call me tonight  
I'll make you feel good  
Come on, call me  
Come on, call me  
Call me tonight  
I'll make you feel good  
Want your body  
Want your body  
  
Come on, call me  
Come on, call me  
  
For your own good  
Call me tonight
