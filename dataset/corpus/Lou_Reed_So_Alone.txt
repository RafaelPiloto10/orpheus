She calls on the phone  
She says she doesn't want to be alone  
She says it's making her neurotic  
But please don't mistake it for being erotic  
  
So alone, so all alone  
She says let's go for a walk  
We'll have a drink and maybe we will talk  
And he thinks she has possibilities  
If she could just put away her rosary  
  
So alone, nobody wants to be alone  
But I just didn't know  
I swear to you, I just didn't know  
I would never make you sad  
If I had known I never would have  
Said those things to you  
You have to be crazy to say those things to you  
  
Let's face it I made a mistake  
Well you know, fools rush in where angels take a break  
I can't be smart all of the time  
And anyway I didn't know you were making time over him  
  
To tell you the truth, I forget all about him  
And you know, I don't think it's nice  
Asking one man about another man's vice  
I don't care if you pick my head  
As long as we end up in bed  
  
Alone, just the two of us alone  
I just didn't know  
I swear to God, I just didn't know  
Can't you understand that it's frightening  
When you hear women talking about castrating and hating men  
Who wants to know about how you hate men  
  
Well, you said now you wanted to dance  
So now we're going to dance  
You said that you weren't complete  
But we're going to put you on your feet  
You said that you were very vexed  
You told me to forget about sex  
You said you liked me for my mind  
Well, I really love your behind  
  
Oh, get up and boogie, oh baby, get up and dance  
Oh, get, get, get, get up and boogie, baby, oh, get up and dance  
Shake your booty, mama, oh, get up and dance  
  
Your points very clear  
You're not one to cry into your beer  
Why don't we go to my place  
Believe me, I'm very chaste  
And I'm so alone, ao all alone  
  
Sure all men are beasts  
Hey, look, I'll sit here quietly and I'll stare at my feet  
I don't blame you for taking umbrage  
With animals staring at your cleavage  
So alone, we're so all alone  
  
Hey, do you mind if I turn out the light  
Don't take offense, but why don't you spend the night  
I know your passions run very deep  
But at this point we both need sleep  
So alone, and who wants to be alone
