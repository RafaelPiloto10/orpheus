You always say you like my style.  
You say I'm tough and kind of wild.  
Am I too much for you to tame?  
I swear this time it's not a game.  
I've known a lot of girls.  
No, this I won't deny.  
I'll give our love,  
I'll give it more than a try.  
That was then, (that was then) this is now.  
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.  
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.  
That was then, this is now  
I've led a thousand lives it seems.  
And there's been a lot of broken dreams.  
My mind's just swept love aside.  
But you broke me down and put me wise.  
I've doubted all compassion,  
But you showed me the door.  
I can't doubt it,  
I don't doubt it no more.  
That was then, (that was then) this is now.  
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.  
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.  
That was then, this is now.  
I've known a lot of girls.  
No, this I won't deny.  
I'll give our love,  
I'll give it more than a try.  
That was then, (that was then) this is now.  
Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud.  
I never made (never made) this kind of vow.  
That was then, this is now.  
That was then, this is now.  
That was then, this is now.
