I slipped,  
Didn't mean to do it that way.  
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow?  
I've gone today  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
Come,  
Lets play it loud and let each other lose  
A win would cause an alarm  
Don't matter to me  
Don't matter to you  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
I could keep you all for myself  
I know  
You gotta be free  
So free yourself  
  
I could keep you all for myself  
I know  
You gotta be free  
So free yourself  
  
Self inflicted wound, your gift,  
Impeccable aim  
Can really clear a room  
All the bodies piled up in your way  
  
Oh yeah it hurts so bad  
Oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
I could keep you all for myself  
I know  
You gotta be free  
So free yourself  
  
I could keep you all for myself  
I know  
You gotta be free  
To kill yourself
