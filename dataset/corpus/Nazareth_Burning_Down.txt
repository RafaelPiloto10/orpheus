If it takes them so long  
So long to say yes  
Why don't they just say no?  
They don't need anyone to be put to the test  
Why don't they let us go  
  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
  
We needed a plan, we needed defenses  
We couldn't raise a smile  
As the world looked on, they raided our senses  
There can be no reconcile  
  
Burning down, burning down, burning down, burning down  
  
There was a time before life was taken for granted  
'Will never come again  
Our flower is dead, the seed is unplanted  
They put it all to flame  
  
Burning down, burning down, burning down, burning down  
  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
  
Burning down, burning down , burning down , burning down
