Just a perfect day  
Drink sangria in the park  
Then later when it gets dark  
We go home  
  
Just a perfect day  
Feed animals in the zoo  
Then later a movie too  
And then home  
  
Oh it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
Just a perfect day  
Problems all left alone  
Weekenders on our own  
It's such fun  
  
Just a perfect day  
You made me forget myself  
I thought I was someone else  
Someone good  
  
Oh it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow
