Do you remember me?  
I sat upon your knee.  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies.  
Well, I'm all grown up now,  
And still need help somehow.  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream.  
  
So here's my lifelong wish,  
My grown-up Christmas list,  
Not for myself, but for a world in need:  
  
No more lives torn apart,  
That wars would never start,  
And time would heal all hearts.  
And everyone would have a friend,  
And right would always win,  
And love would never end:  
This is my grown-up Christmas list.  
  
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath our tree.  
Well, heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a hurting human soul.  
  
No more lives torn apart,  
That wars would never start,  
And time would heal all hearts.  
Everyone would have a friend,  
And right would always win,  
And love would never end:  
This is my grown-up Christmas list,  
This is my only lifelong wish,  
This is my grown-up Christmas list!
