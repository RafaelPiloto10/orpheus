lies lies  
you're telling me that you'll be true  
  
lies lies  
that's all I ever get from you  
  
tears tears  
I shed a million tears for you  
  
tears tears  
and now you're loving someone new  
  
someday you're gonna be happy  
but I don't know when just now  
  
lies  
lies - breaking my heart  
  
you think that you're such a smart girl  
and I'll believe what you say  
but who do you think you are girl  
to lead me on this way?  
  
lies lies  
I can't believe a word you say  
  
lies lies  
I'm gonna make you sad someday  
  
someday you're gonna be lonely  
but you won't find me around  
  
lies  
lies - breaking my heart  
  
yeah  
  
someday you're gonna be lonely  
but you won't find me around  
  
lies  
lies - breaking my heart  
  
you think that you're such a smart girl  
and I'll believe what you say  
but who do you think you are girl  
to lead me on this way?  
  
lies lies  
I can't believe a word you say  
  
lies lies  
I'm gonna make you sad someday  
  
someday you're gonna be lonely  
but you won't find me around  
  
lies  
lies - breaking my heart  
  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart  
breaking my heart
