This world that I live in is empty and cold the loneliness cuts me and
tortures my soul  
I'm no child of destiny and no fortune's son  
I've just chased you so long now I'm too weak to run  
A new day is here but nothing is new alone in my room I tremble for you  
[ piano ]  
I know I'll return to the backstreets again to find what I need to prove I'm a
man  
And there I'll treat shame like an old friend from home  
That I can lean on till my misery is gone  
A new day is here and nothing is new I'm a picture of weakness as I tremble
for you
