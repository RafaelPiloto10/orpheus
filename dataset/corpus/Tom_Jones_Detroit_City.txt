Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
I dreamed about them cotton fields of home  
I dreamed about my mother, dear old pappy, sister and brother  
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waitin' for so long  
  
I want to go home  
I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home  
  
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think I'm just fine, yes they do  
But by day I make the cars and by night I make the bars  
If only they could read between the lines  
  
('Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City  
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time  
You know what I'm gonna do?  
I'm gonna take my foolish pride  
Get it on a southbound freight and let it ride  
I'm gonna go back to the loved ones  
The ones I left waiting so far behind)  
  
I want to go home, yeah  
I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home (Can't you hear me?)  
  
I want to go home  
Whoa, baby I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home (Somebody help me)  
  
I want to go home, yeah  
I want to go home, whoa oh  
Oh, how I want to go home  
  
[To Fade:]  
Hmm, I want to go home
