I remember the first time I held you all night long.  
Well we're still here now.  
But where have all the years gone?  
Holding you this way tonight.  
It's easy to see why.  
  
[Chorus]  
All this time.  
We held on to each other.  
We knew we had to be strong.  
All this time.  
Through the tears and the laughter.  
It's still forever after all this time.  
  
In the fast movin' world.  
Love is made and just thrown away.  
But we've always kept the promises that we made.  
Who would of thought you and me?  
Would still be here where we said we would be.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
