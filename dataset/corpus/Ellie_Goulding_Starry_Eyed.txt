Oh, oh, starry eyed (starry)  
Starry eyed  
  
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning  
Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone  
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one  
  
Next thing we're touching  
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning  
Ah  
  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh  
  
So we burst into colors, colors and carousels  
Fall head first like paper planes in playground games  
  
Next thing we're touching  
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning  
Ah  
  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh  
  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
Next thing we're touching  
  
Hit me with lightning  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes oh  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And everybody goes  
Oh, everybody's starry eyed  
And my body goes  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
Whoa oh oh ah ah  
(And my body goes)  
Whoa oh oh ah ah
