Once upon a once in a while  
It's hard to remember to smile  
Just like all of your toys  
Can't you see I don't want to play  
I don't need it  
Can't you say you want me to stay  
I'd believe it  
Just like all of your toys  
  
[Chorus]  
When all of your play things  
Someday disappear  
Girl, will you be happy  
With nothing but tears?  
With nothing but tears?  
  
Once upon a once in a while  
It's hard to remember to smile,  
Just like all of your toys  
Don't you ever feel kind of sad?  
Cause you're lonely  
Think about the love that we had  
Are you lonely?  
Just like all of your toys  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ah  
Just like all of your toys, I don't want to be  
Just like all of your toys, I don't need to be  
Just like all of your, just like all of your toys  
I should have known I'd be alone  
No, no, no I don't need it  
Oh, don't you have me believe it  
Just like all of your toys
