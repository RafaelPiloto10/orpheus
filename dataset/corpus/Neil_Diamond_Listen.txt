Listen  
You don't even know my name  
But I wear it just the same  
And you know I won't be long  
Will you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Play it here with my guitar  
Gonna make someone a star  
You can even sing along  
When you listen to my song  
  
Hang on  
Got a different kind of sound  
Moving up to higher ground  
Would you listen, listen, listen  
Would you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Do you hear the sound of change?  
Like a distant rolling train  
But it won't be distant long  
Would you listen to my song  
  
And I know  
Got a bumpy road ahead  
But the music makes my bed  
Would you listen, listen, listen  
Would you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Say friend,  
Do you know a place inside  
Where a boy could spend a night  
Well you know it won't be long  
When they listen to my song  
  
And I know  
Got a bumpy road ahead  
But the music makes my bed  
Would you listen, listen, listen  
Would you listen to my song  
  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Listen  
Listen  
Listen to my song
