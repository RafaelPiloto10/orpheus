Honestly somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming of  
Something I could never be  
It doesn't matter to me cause I will always be that pimp that I see in all  
Of my fantasies  
  
I don't know your fucking name, so what let's  
Screwing may be, the only way that I can truly be free  
From my fucked up reality  
So I dream and stroke it harder cause it's so fun to see  
My face staring back at me  
  
I don't know your fucking name, so what let's fuck  
All day I dream about sex  
All day I dream about fuckin'  
All day I dream about sex, yes  
All day I dream about sex, and  
All day I dream about sex, and  
All day I dream about sex, and  
All day I dream about sex, yes  
All day I dream about sex  
All day I dream about sex  
All day I dream about fuckin'  
All day I dream about sex  
All day I dream about fuckin'
