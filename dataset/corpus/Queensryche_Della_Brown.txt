You've got a cardboard house  
Live there all the time  
Keep your memories tied with string  
The face that many once adored  
Twenty years gone maybe more  
Somewhere you lost the dream  
Mama watched your every move,  
but now you're all alone  
  
She's been gone for awhile  
Daddy left some time ago,  
fading years pass too slow  
He's the only one, could make you smile  
Oh, you're still crying  
  
Big city bound  
Gonna make your mark  
Read your name in the lights  
All the ads and people say,  
beauty lets you get you way  
Tried your best to prove them right  
  
But living on the streets ain't bad,  
sad people make you glad  
Pardon me, could you spare some change  
-Oh, you're still crying-  
  
Street corner girl  
Watch the crowd go by  
Fill your tin can with life  
Summer days tend to slip away  
Like your men you couldn't make them stay  
Hard to choose, whiskey or a wife  
Sometimes you wonder where's the end  
Where you goin' where you been?  
Happiness seems so hard to win  
Most never care to find  
Della Brown sees it al the time  
Looking for that man  
to make her smile again
