Hey, don't I know you from somewhere  
Yeah, it was down in New Orleans  
In one of those back-street bars in the quarter  
Between Desire and Honalee  
You were dancin' with a friend of Michael's  
I remember how we met  
You were talkin' to ol' Jimmy  
And you lit my cigarette  
  
[Chorus:]  
How come you can't remember?  
This is me you're talkin' to  
From May through September  
It was all about me 'n you, baby  
It was all about me 'n you  
  
Well it looks like to me  
That you have conveniently forgotten everything  
This confusion that has surrounded you  
Is this your morality and not your brain  
You've got a birthmark below your navel  
You wear a size seven and a half shoe  
You got this Rolex watch that I suspect you cobbed  
From that doctor who said he loved you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well you told me that you lived in the wind  
Like a bird who never touched the ground  
And if you did you would surely die without making a sound  
"Live, let's live", that's all you kept sayin'  
And our summer was full of life  
We're gonna send them a postcard, and show 'em what it's like to be alive  
But I never wanted to leave your side  
No, I just couldn't believe that you'd lie  
No, I never wanted to say "good-bye" baby  
  
[Chorus:]
