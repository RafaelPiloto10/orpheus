Got a woman that loves me  
And I love her so  
But she's all dressed up now  
With nowhere to go.  
  
All our old hang-outs  
Are boarded up and closed  
Or bein' bought by somebody  
Nobody knows.  
  
But things ain't that bad  
We still got the kids  
We're goin' out to the movies  
Right after this.  
  
Goin' back to school  
Savin' up my tuition  
Gonna rewrite all the rules  
On the old blackboard.  
  
'Cause it seems things today  
There ain't no magic in 'em  
They don't cut the grade  
Like they used to.  
  
Depression blues  
Nowhere to go  
Bein' bought by somebody  
Nobody knows.  
  
Is there anybody out there  
With a voice loud and clear  
Gonna sing all the words  
We all want to hear.  
  
Depression blues  
Nowhere to go  
Bein' bought by somebody  
Nobody knows.
