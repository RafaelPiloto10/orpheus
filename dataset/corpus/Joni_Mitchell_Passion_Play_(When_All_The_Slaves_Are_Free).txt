Magdalene is trembling  
Like a washing on a line  
Trembling and gleaming  
Never before was a man so kind  
Never so redeeming  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Ecstasy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
I am up a sycamore  
Looking through the leaves  
A sinner of some position  
Who in the world can this heart healer be  
This magical physician  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Misery  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
Enter the multitudes  
The walking wounded  
They come to this diver of the heart  
Of the multitudes  
Thy kingdom come  
Thy will be done  
  
Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me  
From the middle of unrest  
They think is light is squandered  
But he sees a stray in the wilderness  
And i see how far I've wandered  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Apathy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
Enter the multitudes  
The walking wounded  
They come to this diver of the heart  
Of the multitudes  
Thy kingdom come  
Thy will be done  
  
Oh, all around the marketplace  
The buzzing of the flies  
The buzzing and the stinging  
Divinely barren  
And wickedly wise  
The killer nails are ringing  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Tragedy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)
