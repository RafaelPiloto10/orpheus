Hello fear  
Before you sit down there's something I need to explain  
Since you're here  
I think I should tell you since we last talked things have changed  
See I'm tired of being brokenhearted  
So I made a list and you're on it  
All my hopes and my dreams you took from me  
I want those back before you leave  
  
Hello fear  
I knew I would see you,  
You have a hard time letting go  
See these tears,  
Take a good look 'cause soon they won't fall anymore  
God's healing my hurtful places  
That seat that was yours now is taken  
I'm no longer afraid, see I'm better this way  
And one more thing before you leave  
  
[Chorus]  
Never again will I love you  
My heart it refuses to be your home  
No longer your prisoner  
Today I remember  
Apart from you is where I belong  
And never again will I trust you  
I'm tired of fighting it's been way too long  
No longer your prisoner  
Today I remember  
Who I was and now it's gone  
  
They're gone, hello fear  
Da da da da da, da da da da da da da  
  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
  
Hello grace  
It feels like forever, I thought my chance with you was gone  
See your face, it reminds me of mercy  
And please let me say I was wrong  
Never knew your touch was endless  
How you never run dry of forgiveness  
Didn't know how bad it was, was afraid just because  
Sorry fear, grace took your place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
Farewell, goodbye, so long  
  
Hello fear  
Before you sit down there's something I need to explain
