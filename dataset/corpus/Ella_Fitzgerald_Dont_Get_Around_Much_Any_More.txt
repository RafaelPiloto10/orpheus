Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darlin', I guess my mind's more at ease  
But, nevertheless, why bring back old memories?  
  
Been invited to dates  
Might have gone, but what for?  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get it around much anymore  
  
Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Been invited to clubs  
Could've gone, but what for?  
Awfully lonesome without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Yes, darlin', I guess my mind's more at ease  
But, nevertheless, why bring back old memories?  
  
Been invited to dates  
Might have gone, but what for?  
Awfully lonesome without you  
Don't get around much anymore
