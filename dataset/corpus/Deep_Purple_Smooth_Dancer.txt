Black suede, don't mean you're good for me  
Black suede, just brings your mystery  
I want to be inside of you  
But you're black and I don't know what to do  
  
You're a smooth dancer  
But it's alright  
'Cause I'm a freelancer  
And you can never break me though you try  
  
To make me think you're magical  
Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun  
Because it don't shine nightly  
Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free  
  
You'd better hang on tightly  
You want to rule the world,  
But you're acting like a girl  
Who's got a false pregnancy  
You've swollen up inside  
With nothing but your pride  
  
And yet you keep on dancing  
Black suede, don't waste your time on me  
Black suede, I sense your mockery  
I tried to go along with you  
  
But you're black and I know just what to do  
You're a smooth dancer  
But it's alright  
'Cause I'm a freelancer  
  
And you can never break me though you try  
To make me think you're magical  
I think you're crazy, your two-timing ways  
They don't bother me none  
  
You'd better do it right because one day or night  
I'm gonna walk to freedom  
You know I loved you once and I want to love again  
But you don't give nothing  
  
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize  
Baby, I ain't bluffing  
Black suede, don't waste your time on me  
Black suede, don't bring me misery  
  
I tried to be inside of you  
But you're black and now I know what to do  
You're a smooth dancer  
But it's alright  
  
'Cause I'm a freelancer  
And I can tell you're faking though you try  
To make me think you're magical  
Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun  
  
Because it don't shine nightly  
Don't you look at me because I'm gonna shake free  
You'd better hang on tightly  
You know I loved you once and I want to love again  
  
But you don't give nothing  
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize  
Baby, I ain't bluffing  
Baby, you can rock 'n' roll  
  
But you can never show your soul, smooth dancer
