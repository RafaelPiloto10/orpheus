Metal and men clash once more to the end  
Warriors above with the power to kill descend  
Militia of blood troops of hate march to die  
Soldiers of Hell veterans of death arise  
  
[Chorus]  
Prepare for attack  
Your body will burn  
Endless war  
There's no return  
Prepare for attack  
Death will arrive  
Your orders are clear  
No way to hide  
Fight till death  
  
Senseless death of all mankind overtakes  
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape  
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave  
There is no future no [fucking] world to [be] save[d].  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[To reign in Hell]  
  
Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man  
Reign of death what is the final command  
Scepters of hate are dropped upon the Earth  
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth  
  
[Chorus]  
[Fight till death [Repeat x 3]]
