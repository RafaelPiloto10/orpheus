Maybe you and I see life with two different visions  
And neither one of us is wrong or right  
Maybe we're too serious and don't want to listen  
I just want to make you laugh tonight  
We are like  
Day and night  
Night and day  
We are both so different in so many ways  
We are like  
Night and day  
Day and night  
And we go together just like black and white  
Seems you're always out one door when I'm in the other  
It's so hard to find some quiet time  
I wish that we could spend our lives alone with each other  
And never think about the world outside  
We are like day and night  
Night and day  
We are oh so different in so many ways  
We are like  
Night and day  
Day and night  
Still we know it's gonna be alright  
And if we never really get the picture right  
How many of us ever really win the fight?  
I never wanna lose your love or let the distance get the best of us  
'Cause time is moving fast enough.  
Maybe we don't always share a common opinion  
It's true that you and I don't think alike  
But when I look into your eyes and all is forgiven  
All I wanna do is hold you tight  
We are like day and night  
Night and day  
We are both so different in so many ways  
We are like  
Night and day  
Day and night  
Still we know it's gonna be alright  
We are like night and day  
Day and night  
And we go together just like black and white  
We are like, we are like, we are like day and night  
Night and day  
Day and night  
Night and day  
We are like, we are like, we are like day and night  
Night and day  
Night...  
Black and white.
