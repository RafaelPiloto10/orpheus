[Verse 1]  
Come and kiss me, baby  
We don't need no mistletoe  
We don't need no fireplace  
Boy, I'll keep you nice and warm  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?  
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy  
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play  
'Tis the season for some love giving  
So I think you should give your love to me  
Baby, let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas?  
  
[Verse 2]  
We don't need no presents, we don't need the kitchen  
We don't need them recipes  
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread  
I'm made with love  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?  
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy  
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play  
'Tis the season for some love giving  
So I think you should give your love to me  
Baby, let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas?
