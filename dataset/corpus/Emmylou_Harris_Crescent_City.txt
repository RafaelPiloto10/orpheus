Everybody's had a few  
Now they're talking about who knows who  
I'm going back to the crescent city  
Where everything's still the same  
This town has said what it has to say  
Now I'm after that back highway  
And the longest bridge I've ever crossed over Pontchartrain  
  
Tu les ton sans temps that's what we say  
We used to dance the night away  
Me and my sister me and my brother  
We used to walk down by the river  
  
Mama lives in mandeville  
I can hardly wait until  
I can hear my zydeco  
And laissez le bon ton roulet  
And take rides in open cars  
My brother knows where the best bars are  
Let's see how these blues'll do  
In the town where the good times stay  
  
Tu les ton sans temps that's what we say  
We used to dance the night away  
Me and my sister me and my brother  
We used to walk down by the river  
  
Tu les ton sans temps that's what we say  
We used to dance the night away  
Me and my sister me and my brother  
We used to walk down by the river
