Didn't notice I was gone  
'Cause you were tying up your arm  
Oh...  
And when I stand on my head  
  
You never react  
I can't get you to crack  
I can't get you to crack  
Not one fucking smile  
  
And when it comes right down to it  
I'm gonna run right back to him  
I want a peace mapped out  
'Cause I really love his stoneface, oh  
  
I really love his stoneface, oh  
I really love it  
A snaky goddess got my man, man  
That kind of love don't understand  
  
Him  
Oh, oh  
And when I swallow my gum  
You never react  
  
I can't get you to crack  
I can't get you to crack  
Not one fucking smile  
And when it comes right down to it  
  
I'm gonna run right back to him  
I want a peace mapped out  
'Cause I really love his stoneface, oh  
I really love his stoneface, oh  
  
I really love it  
Swallow hard, until you  
I'll be the one to thrill you  
I'll be the first to kill you  
  
And if you won't die, I will  
When I shortsheet the bed  
You never react  
I can't get you to crack  
  
I can't get you to crack  
I can't get you to crack  
I can't get you to crack  
I can't get you to crack  
  
Not one fucking smile  
And when it comes right down to it  
I'm gonna run right back to him  
I want a piece knocked out of him  
  
I really love his stoneface, oh  
I really love his stoneface, oh  
I really love it
