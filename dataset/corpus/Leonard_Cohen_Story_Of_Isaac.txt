The door it opened slowly,  
My father he came in,  
I was nine years old.  
And he stood so tall above me,  
His blue eyes they were shining  
And his voice was very cold.  
He said, "I've had a vision  
And you know I'm strong and holy,  
I must do what I've been told."  
So he started up the mountain,  
I was running, he was walking,  
And his axe was made of gold.  
  
Well, the trees they got much smaller,  
The lake a lady's mirror,  
We stopped to drink some wine.  
Then he threw the bottle over.  
Broke a minute later  
And he put his hand on mine.  
Thought I saw an eagle  
But it might have been a vulture,  
I never could decide.  
Then my father built an altar,  
He looked once behind his shoulder,  
He knew I would not hide.  
  
You who build these altars now  
To sacrifice these children,  
You must not do it anymore.  
A scheme is not a vision  
And you never have been tempted  
By a demon or a god.  
You who stand above them now,  
Your hatchets blunt and bloody,  
You were not there before,  
When I lay upon a mountain  
And my father's hand was trembling  
With the beauty of the word.  
  
And if you call me brother now,  
Forgive me if I inquire,  
"just according to whose plan?"  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will kill you if I must,  
I will help you if I can.  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will help you if I must,  
I will kill you if I can.  
And mercy on our uniform,  
Man of peace or man of war,  
The peacock spreads his fan.
