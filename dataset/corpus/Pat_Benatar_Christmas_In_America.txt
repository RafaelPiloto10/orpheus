It's Christmas in America  
There's carols in the air  
The snow falling on the ground  
There's holly everywhere  
The people they're all different too  
Their troubles put aside  
They smile a little brighter  
It seems at Christmas time  
It's Christmas in America  
Let the angels sing  
It's Christmas in America  
Let freedom ring  
Let peace resound throughout the world  
Especially on this day  
It's Christmas in America  
God bless the USA  
The kids get so excited  
Preparing for the day  
Their letters to Santa have all been sent  
The cookies have been baked  
The creche under the Christmas tree  
Awaits the baby child  
It seems to mean so much more this year  
Than it has in a while  
Coz It's Christmas in America  
Let the angels sing  
It's Christmas in America  
Let freedom ring  
Let peace resound throughout the world  
Especially on this day  
It's Christmas in America  
God bless the USA  
So keep your babies close tonight  
Hug your husband, kiss your wife  
Be thankful for this way of life,  
We're fortunate to share  
And not forget the ones we've lost  
Their memory lives on in our hearts  
They'll be forever in our thoughts  
And always in our prayers  
Unto this world a child is born  
His gift was meant for everyone  
The light of peace shines on and on  
And never fades away  
America, America indivisible we are  
One nation under God  
And that will never change  
Coz It's Christmas in America  
Let the angels sing  
It's Christmas in America  
Let freedom ring  
Let peace resound throughout the world  
Especially on this day  
It's Christmas in America  
God bless the USA  
It's Christmas in America  
God bless the USA
