Chorus:  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me, How could I have been so blind?  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you?  
  
You never looked as good to me as you look tonight  
Oh yeah  
It's like I've seen you for the first time  
Through a lovers eyes.  
Oh Could it be  
That I never knew its always been you that I've been looking for  
You were always right here by my side  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus:  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me, How could I have been so blind?  
You were here all the time  
Oh Yeah  
Could it be you?  
  
The girl I always have dreams about  
The one I just can't live without  
Is it so tell me now  
Could it be you  
Can you imagine what it's like to always live without love  
I need to have you in my life  
I think I know that now  
My open heart (open heart)  
Make you a part (make you apart)  
A part of this lovin I've been keepin (i've been keeping for)  
And I might just give it all to you  
Oh ho  
  
Chorus:  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me, How could I have been so blind?  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you?  
The girl I always have dreams about  
The one I just can't live without  
Is it so tell me now  
  
Every girl I meet  
Though they might be sweet  
They can't compare to you  
So I search no more what I'm looking for  
I know I found in you  
  
Chorus:  
Could it be you?  
I've been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you?  
  
The girl I always have dreams about  
The one I just can't live without
