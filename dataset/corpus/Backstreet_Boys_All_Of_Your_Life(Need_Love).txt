Hey  
Yeah, yeah  
I wanna know  
Can we spend this life together  
Be a shield from rain and weather  
Tell me can I  
Baby tell me can I be your man  
  
Let's be lovers (lovers)  
Girl, you promise to be faithful  
True and honest here forever  
I know you've been hurt  
But you really need to give us a chance  
  
[Chorus:]  
You need love  
Please don't change the way you are  
Soon you'll live within my heart  
You deserve it, you know it  
You've been searching for it all of your life  
You need love  
Don't be scared to try again  
You can rest upon a chance  
And I'll hold you, I'll save you  
You've been searching for it all of your life  
You need love (you need love)  
  
I need to know  
Can I be the one you trust  
Be your friend I'll give you all  
All of the things you dream of  
Tell me can I be your man  
  
Hole in your heart  
There's a wound I wanna heal  
If you're willing I'll be here  
Here to fix the broken  
Let me change the life you live  
  
[Chorus:]  
You need love  
Please don't change the way you are  
Soon you'll live within my heart  
You deserve it, you know it  
You've been searching for it all of your life  
You need love  
Don't be scared to try again  
You can rest upon a chance  
And I'll hold you, I'll save you  
You've been searching for it all of your life  
You need love (you need love)  
  
You've been searching for it  
All of your life  
Yeah  
  
You've been searching for it  
All of your life  
Ooh ooh  
  
You need love (you need love)  
Don't change the way you are  
You need love  
Searching for it all of your live
