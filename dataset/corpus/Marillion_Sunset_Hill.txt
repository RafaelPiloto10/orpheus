Everything to decide  
It's time I came up with some answers before I can carry on  
It's time I made my mind up before we can go along  
  
And I thought it was so simple  
And I knew that it could be so fine  
I know that the places that everything comes  
  
Rose beds scattered across the lawn  
Like the squares at Waterloo  
With the bayonets of thorns repelling  
Small children in search of lost tennis balls  
Seeing everything and giving their all  
  
I used to be scared of heights  
I used to get dizzy  
I never felt safe with my feet on the ground  
They said that up there the air would be clearer  
They said more space and more room to breathe  
  
Everything to the side  
I knew that something would happen  
It's better off than being alive  
I knew the standards decline  
I knew that we had to decide  
All the places that all we'd ever seen  
And the place that we thought about  
And the road that you travel has never been seen  
  
Rose beds scattered across the lawn  
Like the squares of Waterloo  
With the bayonets of thorns repelling  
Small children in search of lost tennis balls  
Giving everything and giving it all  
  
I used to think everything was coming up roses  
But I couldn't see the weeds that entangled my feet  
I couldn't see the trees  
'Cause my forest was burning  
I couldn't see the bridges the fire in my eyes  
They sold me the view from the hill  
They sold me the view from the hill  
  
They said that up there the air would be clearer  
They said more space and more room to breathe  
I used to be scared of heights  
I used to get dizzy  
They sold me the view from the hill
