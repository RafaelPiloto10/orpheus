God of restoration  
My hope is in the life You bring to me  
Healer of my wounds  
I thank You, O I thank You  
  
God of my salvation  
With saving love You came to rescue me  
Healer of my soul  
I thank You, O I thank You  
Today and every day...  
  
I am Yours, I am Yours  
Every breath that I breathe  
Every moment that's lived  
I am Yours, I am Yours  
You're the reason to breathe  
You're the reason to live  
And now everyone that You have saved  
Will come to be Your praise  
  
I am Yours  
  
Singing of a love now  
You taught this broken heart to sing again  
Everyday I'll sing, to thank You,  
O to thank You  
Singing of a life now  
You taught this wounded soul to live again.  
Everyday I'll live, to thank You,  
O to thank You  
And today and everyday...  
  
And if my food is to do Your will  
Then I'm hungry, still hungry  
There's so much more  
That I need to give  
To thank You, to thank You  
Today and every day
