How long, how long baby  
How long has it been  
How long you gonna keep me wondering  
How long before you see  
Stallin' me was wrong  
How long  
  
How long, how long you gonna keep  
Slappin' my hand away  
How long you gonna keep my love at bay  
How long before you're sure  
My love is strong  
How long  
  
How long, how long you gonna keep  
Tellin' me you like me fine  
How long until I'm gonna make you mine  
How long before wake up  
And find your good man gone  
How long
