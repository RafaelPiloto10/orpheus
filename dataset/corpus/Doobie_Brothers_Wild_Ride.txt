As the wind blows down the canyon,  
And the rain falls on the river,  
I can hear her song of wishes.  
I can feel her body shiver.  
Her boots are made of feathers,  
Flying as she runs  
Across this painted desert,  
With a suitcase full of guns.  
Wild, wild ride.  
And the world goes 'round and 'round.  
Wild, wild ride.  
You go crazy from the sound.  
  
Near the old abandoned drive-in,  
There's a brand new Motel 6.  
It's hard to make a livin',  
But you work to get your kicks.  
You don't know how you got here,  
But it comes as no surprise.  
When the rust gets in your engine,  
And the dust gets in your eyes.  
  
Wild, wild ride.  
And the world goes 'round and 'round.  
Wild, wild ride.  
You go crazy from the sound.  
  
From Mobile to Milwaukee,  
Seattle, St. Joe.  
From Memphis to Miami,  
To the streets of Tokyo.  
Take a trip among the livin',  
Make a circle in the sky.  
It's a good day for believin',  
That we're never gonna die.
