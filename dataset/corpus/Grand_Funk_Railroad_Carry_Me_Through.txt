Time has come,  
To start my search for tomorrow.  
On and on,  
There's just no end to the sorrow.  
But I designed a way,  
To see my life through pity.  
I don't have too much to say,  
And the tears won't let me be.  
  
So,  
Chorus  
Carry me through the hard part.  
Help me find a new start.  
Carry me through the hard part.  
  
Far too long,  
I've thought of all the excuses.  
Try to go on,  
And stay my time to an end.  
Dreams in my head,  
All turning dark and useless.  
Help me find the hand,  
That knows where I've been.  
  
Please,  
Chorus  
  
Ahhhhhh ...  
Ahhhhhh ...  
  
Carry me through ...  
Carry me through ...  
Carry me through ...  
Carry me, carry me, carry me ...
