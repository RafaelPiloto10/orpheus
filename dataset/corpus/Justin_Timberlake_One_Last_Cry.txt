My shattered dreams and broken heart  
Are mending on the shelf  
I saw you, holding hands  
Standing close to someone else  
Still I sit, all alone  
Wishing all my feelings gone  
I give my best to you  
Nothing for me to do  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I gotta put you out of my mind  
This time  
Believe that I  
I guess I'm down to my last cry  
[Cry...]  
  
I was here, you were there  
Guess we never could agree  
While the sun shines on you  
I need some love to rain on me  
Still I sit, all alone  
Wishing all my feelings gone  
Gotta get over you [Gotta get over you]  
Nothing for me to do [Yeah..]  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I gotta put you out of my mind  
This time..  
Believe that I  
I know I've gotta be strong  
Cos my whole life goes on and on  
And on.. And on.... [Oh..]  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes  
Right after I have my  
One last cry..  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I gotta put you out of my mind  
For the very last time  
Believe that I  
I guess I'm down, I guess I'm down  
I guess I'm down to my last cry..
