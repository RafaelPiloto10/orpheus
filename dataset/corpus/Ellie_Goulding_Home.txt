Lonely thoughts,  
They seep into mind, into me  
Brush your teeth  
Wash the dirt,  
A hard days work, know my place  
  
On my own  
No poison in my bones  
On my own  
This is where I build my home  
  
My home  
This will always be my home  
This will always be my home  
  
I work until its late  
Will again close the gates  
I look in the window and I gaze on my face  
Every line and every abrasion  
This took my life to make  
This took my life to make  
  
On my own  
No poison in my bones  
On my own  
This is where I build my home  
  
I need someone to hold  
I need someone to hold  
  
On my own  
  
My home  
This will always be my home  
This will always be my home
