It's sad to see we may never be the way we were before  
We don't believe in the magic of the music anymore  
And everything's older now and colder and grey  
Oh, darlin' I believe there's got to be a better way.  
  
It seems to me we've forgotten how to let our feelings show  
We seem to be so much farther from the dreams we used to know  
And too many more, my friend, are dying today  
Oh darlin' I believe there's got to be a better way.  
  
Listen to the fallen angels learning how to spread their wings.  
How will they make it all alone?  
Look into the children's laughter  
Tell me what tomorrow brings for those so far away from home.  
  
And I can say I'm not sorry for the things we tried to be  
But I'm afraid what we're heading toward is up, to you and me  
'Cause we got a choice, the future is ours you see  
We got a chance to change today  
  
Oh, darlin' don't you believe there's got to be a better way  
'Cause we got a choice, the furture is ours you see  
We got a chance to change it today.  
Oh I believe together there can be a better way  
Oh if we believe together we can build a better way.
