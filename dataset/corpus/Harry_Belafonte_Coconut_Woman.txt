Coconut woman is calling out  
And everyday you can hear her shout  
Get your coconut water, four for five  
Man it's good for your daughter, four for five  
Coco got a lotta iron, four for five  
Make you strong like a lion, four for five  
  
A lady tell me the other day  
No one can take her sweet man away  
I ask her what was the mystery  
She say coconut water and rice curry  
You can cook it in a pot, four for five  
You can serve it very hot, four for five  
Coco got a lotta iron, four for five  
Make you strong like a lion, four for five  
  
Coconut woman says you'll agree

The thing that's best if you're feelin' glum  
Is coconut water with a little rum  
It could make you very tipsy, four for five  
Make you feel like a gypsy, four for five  
Coco got a lotta iron, four for five  
Make you strong like a lion, four for five
