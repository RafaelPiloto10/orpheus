Glo-glo-gloria  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing over the plain  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  
Glo-glo-gloria in excelsis Deo  
Ooh, no, yeah yeah  
  
Shepards, why this jubilee  
Why your joyous song prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be, ohh  
That inspire your heavenly song  
Glo-glo-gloria in excelsis Deo  
Oh oh oh, ooh, oh, oh yeah  
  
Ohh, come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing, oh  
Come on adore on bended knee  
Christ, the Lord, our new-born King  
Glo-glo-gloria in excelsis Deo  
Oh yeah  
  
On the day, that Christ was born  
The angels sang such a heavenly song  
In excelsis Deo, ohh  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Angels we have heard on high  
Angels we have heard on high  
Angels we have heard on high  
In excelsis Deo, in excelsis Deo  
  
In excelsis Deo
