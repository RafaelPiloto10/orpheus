Hey, you like boots and perfume  
Hey, your red pumps and your Cadillac blues  
Hey, you want that fine white wine on my dime  
  
What you want from me?  
'Cause you're on my mind  
Don't you care no more  
That you're losing yourself?  
Don't you want some truth?  
'Cause I'll give you mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, when I'm making my movie, baby  
You keep saying all my lines  
Hey, after Sunset Drive cruising, baby  
You're just yesterday's prize  
  
Hey, do, do, do, do, do  
You want trips on a white yacht for two  
Hey, you want Beverly Heights  
Bright lights  
Late nights  
  
What you want from me?  
'Cause you're on my mind  
Don't you care no more  
That you're losing yourself?  
Don't you want some truth?  
'Cause I'll give you mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues  
You want trips on a white yacht for two  
Your red pumps and your Cadillac blues  
You like boots and expensive perfume  
  
[Chorus]
