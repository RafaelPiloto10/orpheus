When I look in your eyes  
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes  
I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes  
When I look in your eyes  
And it is no surprise  
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes  
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies  
When I look in your eyes  
In your eyes  
I see the deepness of the sea  
I see the deepness of the love  
The love I feel you feel for me  
Autumn comes, summer dies  
I see the passing of the years in your eyes  
And when we part there'll be not tears, no good-byes  
I'll just look into your eyes  
In your eyes  
I see the deepness of the sea  
I see the deepness of the love  
The love I feel you feel for me  
Autumn comes, summer dies  
I see the passing of the years in your eyes  
And when we part there'll be not tears, no good-byes  
I'll just look into your eyes  
Those eyes so wise, so warm, so real  
How I love the world your eyes reveal
