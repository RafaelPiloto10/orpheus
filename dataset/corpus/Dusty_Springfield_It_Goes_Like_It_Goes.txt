Ain't no miracle being born  
People doin' it everyday  
It ain't no miracle growing up, ah  
People just grow that way  
  
So it goes like it goes  
Like the river flows  
And time it rolls right on  
And maybe what's good gets a little bit better  
And maybe what's bad gets gone  
  
Ah, bless the child of a working man  
She knows too soon who she is  
And bless the hands of a working man  
Oh, he knows his soul is his  
  
So it goes like it goes  
Like the river flows  
And time it rolls right on  
And maybe what's good gets a little bit better  
And maybe what's bad gets gone  
  
So it goes like it goes  
Like the river flows  
And time keeps rolling right on, oh  
And maybe what's good gets a little bit better  
And maybe what's bad gets gone
