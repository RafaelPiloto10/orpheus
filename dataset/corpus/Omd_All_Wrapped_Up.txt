Stop stop going around  
With the girl that I love  
She's already taken  
She's all sewn up  
It'll only end in tears  
She'll only break your heart  
If my fist doesn't get you  
Before she tears you apart  
  
Stop stop going places  
Where you know that she goes  
I've heard all the stories  
It's just another pose  
You'll only get rejected  
Just when you think you've scored  
And when you think you've made it  
She'll be walking through that door  
  
Every little now  
And every little then  
Toe to toe with my best friend  
Arm in arm in luxury  
Heaven knows you won't see me  
Again  
  
Well  
You'd better be careful  
With the things that you say  
Your mouth will get you in trouble  
One of these days  
I know you don't believe me  
And I know it seems absurd  
But it just goes to show  
How little you know that girl  
  
Every little now  
And every little then  
Toe to toe with my best friend  
Arm in arm in luxury  
Heaven knows you won't see me  
Again
