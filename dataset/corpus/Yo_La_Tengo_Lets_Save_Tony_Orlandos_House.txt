We proudly welcome Tony Orlando  
The state fair marquee reads  
Inside 1000 people with yellow ribbons sing  
And clap on 1 and 3  
Watch him burn  
He's dropping to his knees  
Watch him burn  
A medley: hits from Grease  
Watch him burn  
He never fails to please  
Meanwhile in Taho outside Casa Tony  
Wetting rags in gasoline  
A jealous Frankie Valli says  
"Dawn, I want you back"  
Lights a match and counts to 3  
Watch it burn  
Reluctantly he leaves  
Watch it burn  
Acrid smoke making him wheeze  
Watch it burn  
Humming "Sherry," splits the scene  
Watch it burn  
Reluctantly he leaves  
Watch it burn  
Acrid smoke making him wheeze  
Watch it burn  
??? splits the scene  
We're sorry to inform you  
Tony Orlando has been postponed
