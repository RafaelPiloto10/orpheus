If I could change the things I've done  
Would I be the only one  
To with again if only I could take your pain away  
And think of better, better things to say  
The highest price I'd gladly pay  
For you to live, just golden days, golden days, golden days  
So celebrate the moment now, have all that you desire  
[Chorus:]  
We'll keep each other warm, together we'll weather the storm  
The children are dying and nobody's crying  
There's got to be something out there, someone who cares  
Got to be something out there  
Give me real life, the worry and the strife  
I'll throw it out of the window, to the dogs below  
So come with me I'll guide you through wardrobes of fantasy  
And treasure chests of what could be  
A world without anxiety  
A legacy of golden days, golden days, golden days  
Leave it all behind the blind leading the blind  
Have all that you desire  
Gotta be, gotta be someone out there  
Let's break the rules scattering the jewels  
Of joy amongst ourselves  
The lonely, lonely of the shelves  
Feel good about yourself, I'll drink to your health  
Have all that you desire  
[Chorus]  
I'm looking for something, and I don't know what it is
