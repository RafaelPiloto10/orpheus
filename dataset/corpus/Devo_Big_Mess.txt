Cowboy kim I am  
I am a lucky cowboy  
Let me tell you why  
I'm a man with a mission  
A boy with a gun  
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one  
  
I'll announce the winner  
On the radio  
With my microphone  
I do a super show  
I wear a cowboy hat  
It is my business hat  
I'm on till 1:00 a.m.  
I must tell you that  
I'm a man with a mission  
A boy with a gun  
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one  
Who doesn't know I'm a big mess  
I mean a really big mess  
  
A big big mess he was all mixed up and a  
Big mess he was a  
Big mess he was a  
He was really mixed up  
  
Cowboy Kim I am  
Mr. reality  
The most important thing  
I put away my toys  
With my microphone  
I do a super show  
I'll announce the winner  
On the radio
