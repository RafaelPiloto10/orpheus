Everybody says I'm better off without him  
And Bobby never was my kind of boy  
I must have heard a hundred times  
How smart I was to leave that guy  
But I know that  
I was fooling everyone but me  
O-O-Oh  
But how am I supposed to make them see  
That I didn't say goodbye  
Bobby did, Bobby did  
Every time somebody says congratulations  
I just want to find a place for me to hide  
Cause when it's him they're talking of  
That talk's about the boy I love  
Oh yeah,  
To think I'm the one who put him down  
O-O-Oh  
But it was just the other way around  
No, I never said goodbye  
Bobby did, Bobby did  
Cause when it's him they're talking of  
That talk's about the boy I love  
Oh yeah,  
To think I'm the one who put him down  
O-O-Oh  
But it was just the other way around  
No, I never said goodbye  
Bobby did, Bobby did  
Oh, Bobby did  
Bobby did  
Oh, Bobby did
