She's standing by the waterside, she's waiting for her man  
On the evening wind, she hears the whistle blow  
It's coming from the factory, she hears it every day  
Her soft cheeks flush, he's on his way  
  
They're going where the sun is shining  
They're going for that silver lining  
They're gonna work and make it pay  
  
And she say 'mmm, well, one fine day  
Spread those wings, fly away'  
Now I don't lie, no, cold wind and rain  
Gonna sail away one fine day  
  
Now hope, it springs eternally  
At least that's what they say  
Boy, it gets hard to feel that way  
  
When he sees his little darling hide  
The tear with a smile  
He say 'come here baby, now don't you cry'
