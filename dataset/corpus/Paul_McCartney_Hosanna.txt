Come now lady don't you do me wrong.  
I fell for you and now it wont be long.  
Before I hold you in my arms.  
Before I take you to my heart again.  
  
Time is flying by us every day.  
I want to show my love in every way.  
I wanna hold you in my arms.  
I wanna take you to my heart again.  
  
If you believe it you can stay all night.  
Hide in the darkness til its getting light.  
Do everything until we've got it done.  
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
Hosanna, hosanna.  
Sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
  
Come down lady don't put up a fight.  
If you are true you know the time is right.  
For me to hold you in my arms.  
For me to take you to my heart.  
  
If you believe it we can stay all night.  
Hide in the darkness til its getting light.  
Do everything until we've got it done.  
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
Hosanna, hosanna.  
  
Sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
Hosanna, hosanna
