I ain't lookin' for just excitement  
Baby that's just a fact  
If you want to get to her heart  
You better let her know just where you're at  
  
[Chorus]  
It ain't written in the sky above  
No fortune-teller told me this  
You gotta tell her that you love her  
Tell her that you need her  
And give the girl a great big kiss  
Give the girl a great big kiss  
  
Now if you're such a fool you think  
It don't matter, baby, what you say  
maybe you better tell her how you're feelin'  
It ain't gonna happen any other way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now baby all I want to do  
Is darlin' make sweet love to you  
  
Now I don't know what the meanin' is  
Why you want to hide the things you feel and say  
But baby it's just a natural fact  
Love was never meant to be that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now baby all I want to do  
Is darlin' make sweet love to you
