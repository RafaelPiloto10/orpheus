(being, in love)  
Been travelling this road for so long  
My eyes are tired but I carry on  
The sun lays down it's golden threads  
I need a place to rest my head  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
It's hard to be out here on my own  
So far away, so far from home  
I need to touch and feel your skin  
To live this dream in sleep again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
So dream on, dream on  
Freedom comes with timeless sleep  
Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks  
Dream on, dream on  
This hotel room's a lonely place  
It's a one night cell I must escape  
So I drink away my loneliness  
So I can sleep and dream again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
And as I fall into  
The darkness of the night  
You come to rescue me to  
Shield me in your light  
I feel your touch  
The softness of your skin  
You hold me close before  
The day breaks in  
This dream's so true  
My heart it beats, it beats  
It beats for you, for you  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
So dream on, dream on  
Freedom comes with timeless sleep  
Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks  
So dream on, dream on  
Dream on, dream on  
So dream on, dream on  
Dream on
