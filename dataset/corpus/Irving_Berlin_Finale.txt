Frank butler:  
The cowboys, the wrestlers, the tumblers, the clowns  
The roustabouts that move the show at dawn  
  
Annie oakley:  
The music, the spotlights, the people, the towns  
Your baggage with the labels pasted on  
  
Frank butler:  
The sawdust and the horses and the smell  
  
Annie oakley:  
The towel you've taken from the last hotel  
  
Annie oakley, frank butler and chorus:  
There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing  
Everything the traffic will allow  
No where could you have that happy feeling  
When you aren't stealing that extra bow  
  
There's no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold  
You may be stranded out in the cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack o' gold  
Let's go on with the show  
Let's go on with the show!  
  
Annie oakley and frank butler:  
They say that falling in love is wonderful  
It's wonderful, so they say.  
And with a moon up above it's wonderful  
It's wonderful, so they tell me.  
  
Annie oakley:  
I can't recall who said it  
  
Frank butler:  
I know I never read it  
I only know that falling in love is grand  
  
And to hold a girl in your arms  
Is wonderful,  
  
Annie oakley:  
Wonderful...  
  
Annie oakley and frank butler:  
In every way  
So they say
