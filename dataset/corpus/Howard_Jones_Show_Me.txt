We got the same beat runnin' round  
Through this crazy town  
Oh I'm sick and I can't hear it anymore  
And when we touched as the blood and the rain  
We'd be shakin' the ground  
She's sick and there's a way to bring her 'round  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
  
The party drags us over the edge to a poison shore  
I can't carry this desire anymore  
Across the blue sky callin' me with the sweetest demand  
She talks to me of mercy make me understand  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
  
And through these years  
As the tears chase the rain  
The picture has cleared  
Can we face the change  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know
