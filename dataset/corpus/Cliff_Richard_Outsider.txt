Someone else is in your arms tonight  
While I'm all alone and blue  
Someone else would kiss and hold you tight  
Just the way I used to do  
  
I used to be your love  
And now I'm your used to be  
Outsider, that's me  
You'll be dancing cheek to cheek with him  
  
To our favorite melody  
And the tender words you speak to him  
Will be words you spoke to me  
Once I was in your heart  
  
Now someone else holds the key  
Outsider that's me  
I want you so much, so much  
I can look you can look, but musn't touch  
  
I keep waiting for the phone to ring  
But I know it's all in vain  
When you left me you took everything  
But the memories and the pain  
  
I used to be your love
