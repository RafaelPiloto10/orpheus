I love you  
Hums an april breeze  
I love you  
Echo the hills  
  
I love you  
The golden dawn agrees  
As once more she sees  
Daffodils  
  
It's spring again  
And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melodies  
  
I love you  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me

The golden dawn agrees  
As once more she sees  
Daffodils  
  
It's spring again  
And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melodies (mellow melodies)  
  
I love you  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me  
And it all belongs  
To you and me
