All my bags are packed  
I'm ready to go  
I'm standing here outside your door  
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye  
  
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn'  
The taxi 's waiting, he's blowing his horn,  
Already I'm so lonesome I could die  
  
Chorus:  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
I'm leaving on a jetplane,  
Don't know when I'll be back again,  
Oh babe I'd hate to go  
I'd hate to go...  
  
There 're so many times I've let you down  
So many times I've played around  
But now you know that they don't mean a thing  
  
Every place I go, I'll think of you  
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you  
When I come back I'll wear your weddingring  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
  
I'm leaving on a jetplane  
Don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh babe, I hate to go  
I hate to go...  
  
Now the time has come to leave you  
One more time, let me kiss you  
Close your eyes and I'll be on my way  
  
Dream about the days to come  
When I won't have to leave alone,  
About the times when I don't have to say...:  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I'm leaving on a jetplane, I'm leaving on a jetplane,  
I'm leaving on a jetplane, I', leaving on a jetplane.......(fade)
