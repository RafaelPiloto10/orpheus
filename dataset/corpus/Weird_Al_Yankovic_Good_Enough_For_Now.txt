Oh, I couldn't live a single day without you  
Actually, on second thought, well, I suppose I could  
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, honey, you're the greatest  
Well, at any rate, I guess you're pretty good  
Now, it seems to me I'm relatively lucky  
I know I probably couldn't ask for too much more  
I honestly can say you're an above-average lady  
You're almost just what I've been looking for  
You're sort of everything I've ever wanted  
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow  
You're the woman that I've always dreamed off  
Well, not really but you're good enough for now  
You're pretty close to what I've always hoped for  
That's why my love for you is fairly strong  
And I swear I'm never gonna leave you, darlin'  
At least 'til something better comes along  
'Cause you're sort of everything I've ever wanted  
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow  
You're the woman that I've always dreamed off  
Well, not really but you're good enough for now  
No, not really but you're good enough for now
