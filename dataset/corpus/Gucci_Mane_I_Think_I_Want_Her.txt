Chorus  
I want her, I really want her, I think I want her  
Yo girlfriend jus left wit me, yea she's a goner  
Man I want her, I really want her, I gotta have her  
Now I got her, yea gucci got her, I'm bout to smash her x2  
  
Verse 1  
Ya'll ball when ya'll can but I stunt when I wanna  
Yo girlfriend wanna fuck me, I think we're gonna  
Marijuana got my beemer foggy as a summer  
I'm gucci mane laflair bitch, I'm such a premadonna  
I'm east atlanta shawty but I hang where I wanna  
Got a plug in arizona but used to slang on the corner  
Got a chocolate nerdy lookin chick a ryder like wynona  
Ima tax my city plenty when she come from california  
You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner  
I got money stacks as tall as you cause that's just my persona  
I got half a million on my neck come try me if you wanna  
Keep a shooter with a chopper turn you to a organ donor  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 2  
My flow so skitzofrantic that I think I need a straightjacket,  
Straight drop dope flow put me in a crack baggie  
Old school like a 1960 cadillac  
Real well known in every hood that's why these nigga's swagga jackin'  
You're not in my league nowhere close to my tax bracket  
Brick squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket  
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin  
Let yo girlfriend give me becky now the bitch braggin  
Rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin'  
Since I'm Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses  
Everybody still lookin at me when my vette passing  
Brick squad ceo I guarentee the check cashes  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 3  
Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking  
Ferrari pass by damn everybody looking  
A couple million dollars and I'm still straight crooked  
You might had the game on hold but I took it  
I'm hoppin out the drop lambo like a kangaroo  
Gucci brick squad ceo but tell me who the fuck is you  
Like simon says yo' big sister do what I tell her to  
I take risks from the bubble kush and then you know I sell it too  
Milatary rifles you would think I was a ex-marine  
Sk, street sweeper, mac 90 or m16  
No I'm not a fighter or a lover I am just a shooter  
So if you disrespect my squad I'm a have to shoot ya'  
  
Chorus x2
