Ha-ha-haunted  
  
The throat is deep and the mouth is wide  
Saw some things on the other side  
Made me promise to never tell  
But you know me, I can't help myself  
  
Now I've got something you have to see  
They put something inside of me  
The smile is red and its eyes are black  
I don't think I'll be coming back  
  
I don't believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back haunted  
I came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
Everywhere now reminding me  
I am not who I used to be  
I'm afraid this has just begun  
Consequences for what I've done, yeah  
  
I don't believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back, I came back haunted  
I C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
I don't believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
They tried to tell me but I  
I couldn't stop myself and I  
I came back, I came back haunted  
C-C-C-came back haunted  
  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop  
Came back ha-ha-haunted  
Just can't  
Stop
