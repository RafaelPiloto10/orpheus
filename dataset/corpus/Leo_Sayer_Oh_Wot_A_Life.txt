2, 3, 4  
I wanna get back home  
But the bar won't close  
Till ten and thirty tonight  
Oh boy, good God, wot a life  
Some cat down there  
Split his head wide open  
And the doctor died of fright  
Oh, wot a life  
Every woman I see she says to me  
"Get back to your wife"  
  
Everyone I know got their little problems  
Boy, I wanna see some life  
The Fender got busted in the second set  
And the pick-up's up the pike  
And the Leslie sound goes round and round  
And round and round  
  
Oh boy, good God, wot a life  
Get back in my car like a movie star  
It's an Austin Healey Sprite, huh  
Oh boy, wot a life  
I think I'll go dig some weeds down at Mrs G's  
Cut the cross-bar off her bike  
Oh, wot a life  
  
Every woman I see they say to me  
"Now you know what I like"  
Every woman I see they fix me up  
Saying, "Get back to your wife"  
Next number's called paranoia  
It's the story of my life  
And the gigs we do take me down and down  
And down and down and down  
Good God, wot a life  
  
Now the next number we do is called paranoia  
It's the story of my life  
Oh, grr, wot a life  
(Alright, may as well get out of here now:.)
