Let the Earth rejoice  
See the risen King  
On the clouds of praise  
He's exalted forever  
  
We will rise with Him  
Son of righteousness  
And the Earth will shake  
In the glory of heaven  
  
Chorus:  
See the heavens open wide  
And His glory like a flood  
Fill the earth with salvation  
See the nations take His hand  
And in righteousness, they stand  
This is Jesus generation  
  
2nd verse  
  
Chorus  
Glory, glory, glory, Emmanuel, God is with us (till the end)
