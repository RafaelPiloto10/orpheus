I've got a lot of memories,  
To last me the rest of my life  
So if you don't want to love me,  
Well baby that'll be alright  
I'm gonna take all the lovin'  
That I had for you  
Gonna take all the loneliness  
And sit right down with the blues.  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party  
Serve old memories  
I'll give myself a party  
Think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness  
That we once knew  
I'll give myself a party  
Just me and the blues.  
  
A few of your love letters  
A photograph or two  
The gift you gave me on my birthday  
With words of I love you  
There's lots of things to think about  
When you're happy being blue  
I'm gonna take all the heartache  
And sit right down with the blues.  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party  
Serve old memories  
I'll give myself a party  
Think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness  
That we once knew  
I'll give myself a party  
Just me and the blues
