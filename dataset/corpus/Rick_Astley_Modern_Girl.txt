She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
Life is hard in a Midlands town  
For a girl with her head in the clouds  
Everybody puts her down  
She's just one of the crowd  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
Now it's time for her to find  
The way it's always been  
Love is just a word to her  
Another broken dream  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl
