The days of autumn splendor  
Those moments warm and tender  
Was it to beautiful to last?  
The love we shared together  
The dreams we dared together  
Was it to beautiful to last?  
  
Walking hand in hand  
The dawn discloses we  
Were dreaming of a land  
Where love reposes  
But castles made of sand  
Like winter roses  
Are fated to die  
My darling, like you and I  
My darling...  
  
Where are those sweet Septembers  
The joy my heart remembers?  
Lost in the shadows of the past  
The rainbow watched above you  
The sacred words, I love you  
Why did the dream go by so fast?  
  
Walking hand in hand  
The dawn discloses we  
Were dreaming of a land  
Where love reposes  
But castles made of sand  
Like winter roses  
Are fated to die  
My darling, like you and I  
My darling...  
  
Where are those sweet Septembers  
The joy my heart remembers?  
Lost in the shadows of the past  
The rainbow watched above you  
The sacred words, I love you  
Why did that dream go by so fast?  
Was it to beautiful...  
Was it to beautiful to last?
