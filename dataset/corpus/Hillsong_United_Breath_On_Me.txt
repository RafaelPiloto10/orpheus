Breathe on me, breath of God  
Love and life that makes me free  
Breathe on me, breath of God  
Fan the flame within me,  
  
Teach my heart, heal my soul,  
Speak the life, that in Christ we know  
Take me to your sanctuary, breathe on me  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God  
Love and life that makes me free  
Breathe on me, breath of God  
Fan the flame within me,  
  
Speak to me, voice of God  
Soft and still, inside my heart  
Speak to me, Word of God  
Comfort, heal, restore with light  
  
Teach my heart, heal my soul,  
Speak the life, that in Christ we know  
Take me to your sanctuary, breathe on me
