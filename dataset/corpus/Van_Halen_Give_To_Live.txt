Oooh - I can see that you've got  
Fire in your eyes and pain inside your heart  
So many things have come and torn your world apart  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, don't give up,  
Don't give up  
Don't give up  
If you want love  
If you want love, you've got to give a little  
If you want love if you want faith,  
You just believe a little  
If you want love if you want peace,  
Turn your cheek a little ohhh,  
You've got to give  
You've got to give  
You've got to give... to live  
  
An empty hand reaching out for someone  
An empty heart takes so little to fill it's so much  
Easier to push instead of pull  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby don't give up,  
Don't give up,  
Don't give up  
If you want love  
If you want love, you've got to give a little  
If you want love if you want faith,  
You just believe a little  
If you want love if you want peace,  
Turn your cheek a little ohhh,  
You've got to give  
You've got to give  
You've got to give... to live  
  
Each man's a country in his own right oh,  
Every body needs a friend one friend,  
One god, one country  
No man need defend  
I believe in fate and destination  
But so much of that lies in our own hands  
If you know what you want,  
Just go on out and get it  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby don't give up,  
Don't give up,  
Don't give up  
If you want love  
If you want love, you've got to give a little  
If you want love if you want faith,  
You just believe a little  
If you want love if you want peace,  
Turn your cheek a little,  
If you want love you've got to give  
If you want love give to live  
You've got to give to live  
Give to live  
Give to live  
If you wan
