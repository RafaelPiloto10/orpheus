Let's go  
So so you think you can tell  
heaven from hell  
Blue skies from pain  
Can you tell a green field  
from a cold steel rail  
A smile from a veil  
do you think you can tell  
Did they get you to trade  
your heroes for ghosts  
Hot ashes for trees  
Hot air for a cool breeze  
Cold comfort for change  
Did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war  
for a lead role in the cage  
  
Whether you listenin' to hip hip-hop  
Or you tuning to rock  
Refugees on your box  
We gonna take over ya blocks  
  
Lets go  
How I wish, how I wish you were here  
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl  
Year after year  
Runnin' over the same old ground  
What have we found the same old fears  
Wish you were here  
  
Whether you listenin' to rock  
Or pumpin' the hip hip hop  
Refugees on your box  
  
Critics don't mistake this for just any cover tune  
I'ma take y'all to the dark side of the moon  
Kickin' in my moms room this song was just a thought  
A young refugee labeled, just come with a passport  
Dad used to tell me about the American dream  
My dream was waking up the projects  
A young teen listening to hip hop  
My brother tune me into rock  
Put me up on pink floyd and banned from the british blocks  
  
Whether you pumpin' the hip hip hop  
Or you tuning to rock  
Refugees on your box  
We gonna take over the blocks  
From n.j to bk to the u.k
