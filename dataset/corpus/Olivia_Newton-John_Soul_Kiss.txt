Soul kiss  
You left me dreaming  
Now I wonder are things just what they seem  
Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Soul kiss  
Some nights you get me wondering  
Is this the way  
This is a hunger  
Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Somewhere there is a fire burning  
Somewhere inside  
Somewhere there is a heart that's waiting  
To take a ride  
To take the ride to your soul kiss  
  
So this is what it has to lead to  
Take my hand and make me need tp  
I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Soul kiss  
You left me hoping  
Now I wonder is the door still open  
Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Somewhere there is a fire burning  
Somewhere inside  
Somewhere there is a heart that's waiting  
To take a ride  
To take the ride to your soul kiss
