To the corner of the market  
Place your wager to the price of tea in China  
And the smell of dirty money  
On your fingers, in the honeypot is empty  
  
Fall together, pretty boys, don't you cry  
Wrote the sequel to the bible  
Bought the rights to the original sin  
Made the movie, did the business  
Took a mortgage on a mortgage on a loan  
  
Fall together, right now, pretty boy  
Sold the lamborghini baby  
Got the baby, now your broker's on the phone  
From the land of wine and plates  
Send your resume, we'll call you back jack  
  
Fall together, right now, over me  
'Cause nothing very good or very bad  
Will ever last for very long  
Nothing very good or very bad  
Will ever last for very long  
Nothing very good or very bad  
Will ever last for very long  
Nothing very good or very bad  
Will ever last for very long, no
