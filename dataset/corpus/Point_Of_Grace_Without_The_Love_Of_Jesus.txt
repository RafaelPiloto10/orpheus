Words by robert sterling music by john mandeville  
Some think it all comes down to  
Fate and circumstance  
Life falls somewhere between  
Accident and chance  
Some seek solutions to the problems  
They face  
By hoping maybe someday, somehow  
It will all fall in place  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing  
(chorus)  
Without the love of jesus  
The stars wouldn't shine  
Rivers wouldn't run  
And hearts beat out of time  
Without the love of jesus  
Tell me where would we be?  
Lost on a lonely sea  
Without the love of jesus  
There's so much more to life than meets  
The naked eye  
It's no coincidence, no matter how we try  
When we try to deny what we  
Don't understand  
Maybe that's when we fail to see god's  
Providential hand  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing  
(repeat chorus)  
It shouldn't take us a miracle  
Before we finally see  
That jesus' love is the only thing  
That we will ever need  
(repeat chorus)
