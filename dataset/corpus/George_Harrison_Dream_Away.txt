Waking while you're still deep sleeping  
Finding you're not here  
Watching a dream appear  
Tumbling through a thousand centuries  
You don't know where you'll land  
It's so dark in mythology  
Treasures of history to be found  
Near the legends of time  
All the handiworks remain there  
Only a dream away

Greedy feeling wheeling dealing  
Losing what you won  
See the dream come undone  
Stumble you may with the elementary  
Lucky you got so far  
All you owe is apologies  
Measure the mystery and astound  
Without taking up time  
So the handiworks remain there  
Only a dream away

In out, hot cold, up down, young old  
What a lot to do  
Sharing a dream with you
