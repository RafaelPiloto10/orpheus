A bond of trust  
Has been abused  
Something of value  
May be lost  
Give up your job  
Squander your cash, be rash  
Just hold on to your friends  
  
There are more than enough  
To fight and oppose  
Why waste good time  
Fighting the people you like  
Who will fall defending your name  
Oh, don't feel so ashamed  
To have friends  
  
But now you only call me  
When you're feeling depressed  
When you feel happy I'm  
So far from your mind  
My patience is stretched  
My loyalty vexed  
Oh, you're losing all of your friends  
  
Hold on to your friends  
Hold on to your friends  
Resist or move on  
Be mad, be rash  
Smoke and explode  
Sell all of your clothes  
Just bear in mind  
Oh, there just might come a time  
When you need some friends
