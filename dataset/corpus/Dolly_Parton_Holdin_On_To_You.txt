There are those who'd love to love me  
Take me home and take care of me  
Treat me just the way you never do  
But I'm here on your door step  
Something I can't seem to help  
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me  
You place everything above me  
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you  
You don't want me, you don't want me  
  
You just hurt and disappoint me  
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh  
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you  
What is this spell that's on me  
Make me think you own me  
Why do I keep holding on to you  
I just can't shake the feeling  
I only know it's real  
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you  
  
[Chorus:]
