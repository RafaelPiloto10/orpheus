No bed for Beatle John!  
Beatle John Lennon lost his hospital bed yesterday to a patient  
It happened at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, London  
Where John was keeping vigil in the room  
Where his girlfriend, Yoko Ono  
Is being kept under observation  
  
When he realized his bed was needed for an urgent case  
John sent out for a sleeping bag  
And last night  
He was once more happily kicked out alongside Yoko  
In the sleeping bag  
  
Yoko who expects her baby next February  
Will remain in the hospital for another few days  
A Beatles spokesman said  
There is a good chance for the baby's survival  
  
The Beatles win battle of the nude LP!  
The Beatles have won their fight to put out an LP record  
With a sleeve showing John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the nude!  
  
EMI, the world's biggest recording company  
Whose artists includes the Beatles  
Refused to handle the LP called 'Two Virgins'  
Because of the sleeve  
So did the group's American outlet, Capitol Records  
  
But the record with its controversial sleeve  
Will be released in both countries next month  
An official of The Beatles Apple company said last night  
The sleeve has not been censored or altered in any way  
  
We are pleased it is being distributed  
But it may be that some record shops  
Will still refuse to handle it
