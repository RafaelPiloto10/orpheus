I see you walking out that door  
And you know you can hide no more  
If I asked you now  
I know you wouldn't give it up  
  
If I asked you how, you'd give that look to kill  
Oh, it gives you a chill  
But, oh, it gives me a thrill to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me, little pretty?  
Can you tell me, can you tell me  
What's going on in the city?  
  
Sittin' there, tryin' to look so sweet  
Every word you say is full of deceit  
  
If I asked you how, you'd give that look to kill  
Oh, it gives you a chill  
But, oh, it gives me a thrill to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna ask you once again  
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?  
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?  
Gotta tell me once again, do you love me?  
  
Do you love me, do you love me?  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
I'm gonna ask  
You once again, you gotta tell me once again, do you love me?
