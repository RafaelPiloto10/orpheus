We' re born  
We' re crying  
We fall  
We' re trying  
We' re little  
We' re laughing  
We' re lonely sometimes  
  
We grow  
We' re open  
We' re lost  
We' re hoping  
We' re careful  
We' re calling  
We' re leaving behind  
  
You say we need to work together  
With love and care for everyone  
Without the fighting and the anger  
You say the world could be as one  
  
But every time that you say we  
Do you think about me?  
' cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me  
  
We' re strong  
We' re chosen  
We' re scared  
We' re frozen  
We' re hardened  
We' re hopeful  
We' re holding at bay  
  
We take  
We' re giving  
We shake  
We' re living  
We' re lovers  
We' re sinners  
We' re running away  
  
And if we fail to make a difference  
And if our hope is almost gone  
Despite the fighting and the anger  
You say the world could be as one  
  
But every time that you say we  
Do you think about me?  
' cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me  
  
And every time that you say we  
Do you think about me?  
' cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me
