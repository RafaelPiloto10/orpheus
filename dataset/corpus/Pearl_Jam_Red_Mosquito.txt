Watched from the window with a red mosquito...  
I was not allowed to leave the room...  
I saw the sun go down and now it's comin' up...  
Somewhere in the time between...  
I was bitten...must have been the devil...  
He was just payin' me...  
A little visit a reminding me of his presence...  
Lettin' me know...he's a waitin' for me...  
Red man's your neighbor call it behavior...  
While you're climbing up slippery hills...  
Two steps ahead of him, punctures in your neck...  
Hoverin' just above your bed... (2x)  
I was bitten...must have been the devil...  
He was just paying me...  
A little visit, reminding me of his presence...  
And lettin' me know...he's a-waitin'...he's a-waitin'...  
Up there...yeah...  
If I had known then what I now know... (4x)
