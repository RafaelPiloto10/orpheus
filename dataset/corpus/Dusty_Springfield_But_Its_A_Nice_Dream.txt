(Peter Allen)  
  
We'll go away  
Make love all day  
You'll never stay  
But it's a nice dream  
  
Just me for you  
Our whole life through  
It won't come true  
But it's a nice dream  
  
Such a nice dream  
So, kiss me goodbye  
I'm sorry that it went so fast  
Our future has become our past  
Too good we couldn't last  
Oh, and now we see  
With you and me  
One's gotta let go  
But it's a nice dream  
Oh, baby, such a nice dream  
  
So, kiss me goodbye  
I'm sorry that it went so fast  
Our future has become our past  
Too good we couldn't last  
Mmm, and now we see  
With you and me  
One's gotta let go  
And let the other go free  
Aah, in love we'll still be  
Oh, it proves it was real  
It was a real nice dream
