Hello,  
  
This is devo  
We would like  
to say Things go both ways  
New ideas stupid moves  
Nightmares or dreams come true  
Mucho work minus play  
Tension mounts in a twisted face  
Dark clouds in the crystal ball  
Tension mounts in a foreign place  
The screw turns someone calls  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Time out for fun!  
Time out for fun!  
  
So you're living under the gun  
Circumstances have you on the run  
A doctor frowns you feel bad  
Take this you've just been had!  
  
Don't you lose it now listen to us  
Everything's going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everything's going to be all right  
Don't you lose it remember to take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you lose it now listen to us  
Everything's going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everything's going to be all right  
Don't you lose it remember to take  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So your life has just begun  
Somebody else is saying that it's done  
Nurses whisper others grin  
Something's funny at your expense again  
  
Don't you lose it now listen to us  
Everything's going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everything's going to be all right  
Don't you lose it remember to take  
  
[Chorus]
