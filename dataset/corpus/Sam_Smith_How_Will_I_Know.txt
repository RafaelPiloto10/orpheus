Oh it's you I know, you're the one I dream of  
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above,  
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough,  
When I wake from dream, tell me is it really love,  
  
How will I know if you really love me  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you what you know about these things  
  
How will I know if you're thinking of me  
I try to call but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
Oh wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now,  
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love,  
  
How will I know  
How will I know  
How will I know  
How will I know  
  
How will I know if you really love me  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you what you know about these things  
  
How will I know if you're thinking of me  
I try to fall but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak.
