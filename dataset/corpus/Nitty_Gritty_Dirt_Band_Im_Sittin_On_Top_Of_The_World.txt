Sitting on the top of the world  
  
One summer day,  
She went away.  
She gone and left me,  
She gone to stay.  
But now she gone,  
And I don't worry.  
'Cause I'm sitting  
On top of the world.  
  
Worked all the summer,  
And worked all the fall.  
I had to take my Christmas,  
In my overall.  
But now she gone,  
And I don't worry.  
Because I'm sitting  
On top of the world.  
  
Goin' down to the freight yard,  
Just to meet a freight train.  
I'm gonna leave this town,  
Well it's just got too hard.  
But now she gone,  
And I don't worry.  
'Cause I'm sitting  
On top of the world.  
  
One summer day,  
She went away.  
She gone and left me,  
She gone to stay.  
But now she gone,  
And I don't worry.  
'Cause I'm sitting  
On top of the world.
