My heart is sad an' lonely  
For you I sigh, for you dear only,  
Why haven't you seen it?  
I'm all for you, body an' soul!  
  
I spent my days in longing  
And wondering why it's me you're wronging?  
I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you, body an' soul!  
  
I can't believe it, it's hard to concede it  
That you turn away romance  
Are you pretending, it looks like the ending  
Unless I could have one more chance  
To prove dear . . .  
  
My life a wreck you're making  
You know I'm yours for just the taking  
I'd gladly surrender myself to you  
Body an' soul!  
  
My life a wreck you're making  
You know I'm yours for just the taking  
I'd gladly surrender myself to you  
Body an' soul!
