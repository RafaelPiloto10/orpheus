(jack hues)  
If you have to leave after all that we've  
Been through, been through  
Been through  
I can't be a friend if your heart has the end  
In view, in view  
In view  
Chorus:  
Because lovers never can be  
Just devoted friends  
How can we meet on a day in the week  
And be true, be true  
Be true  
And how can I speak and pretend that I'm happy for you  
For you, for you  
Repeat chorus  
How can we meet on a day in the week  
And be true, be true  
Be true  
And how can I speak and pretend that I'm happy for you  
For you, for you
