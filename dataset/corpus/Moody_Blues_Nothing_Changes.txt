The dark cloak of winter's war  
Left a future still unsure  
Sitting in a class  
Of the future's past  
We saw a list of dates  
And we knew we would last  
To see them all.  
  
1984 was a year to fear  
Hope was dead, a police state here  
Halley's comet was to fly by  
And we would see a shining in the nighht sky  
Now 2001 is soon to come  
And just as soon will have come and gone  
Nothing changes.  
  
Standing at the crossroads  
Of what is, will be, and was  
The obvious eludes us  
Not because the zeroes line up  
We should change our way of thought  
More if we do not, the way ahead  
Is dangerously fraught  
And if we did the things we all know to be right  
Left would be the childish fears  
Of danger in the night.  
  
We, each of us are fine  
For we have all heard the word  
But grouped together  
Babel's triumph stampedes  
The thoughtless herd  
Nothing changes.  
  
Nothing changes  
And nothing stays the same  
And life is still  
A simple game.
