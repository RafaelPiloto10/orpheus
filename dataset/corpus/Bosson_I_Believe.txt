You say of love  
There's no such thing  
You've only known  
The pain it brings  
  
You question why  
I give your heart  
You stay alone  
You stay apart  
  
I've seen  
I know  
I trust  
I feel  
Love is alive and for real  
  
And I believe  
I believe in love  
I believe two hearts  
Can learn to beat as one  
  
And I believe  
I believe that time  
Can tie your soul to mine  
I see the doubt there in your eyes  
But I believe (in love)  
  
I know you're scared  
I understand  
Please take my word  
And take my hand  
  
If there's no faith  
Inside of you  
I can believe  
Enough for two  
  
I've seen  
I know  
I feel  
I trust  
Love has a future for us  
  
I believe I believe in love  
Two hearts can beat as one  
I believe I believe that time  
Can tie your soul to mine
