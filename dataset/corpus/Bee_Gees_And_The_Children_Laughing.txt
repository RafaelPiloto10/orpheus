Ah...  
Well, I been working up a fever trying to  
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place  
I can't contain myself anymore  
Can't you see it's written all over my face  
Why don't you get on your feet  
It's about time you got to think  
What ever happened to peace  
Well open your eyes and you'll see children laughing,  
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...  
  
Your always talkin' right and talkin' about  
The world and it's corruption and moral decay  
But what you gonna do about it, nothing,  
'Cause you're more like children then children while they play  
Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands  
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you  
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
You're so blown up with anger about the world  
You write the songs about  
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name  
Now you want to go the the moon and live there  
When you know it'll only end up the same  
How can he give you any gratitude,  
With your endless sickenin' attitude  
You strive to get ahead  
But you leave each other dead  
Can't you see, children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
Children laughin', voices singin' hearts beatin'  
Children laughin', voices singin', (fade)
