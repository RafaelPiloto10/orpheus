Hey, everyday of the week  
I'm in a different city  
If I stay too long  
The people try to pull me down  
  
They talk about me like a dog  
Talk about the clothes I wear  
But they don't realize  
They're the ones who's square  
  
Yeah, and that's why  
You can't hold me down  
I don't want to be tied down  
I gotta move on, hey  
  
Stone free, do what I please  
Stone free, to ride the breeze  
Stone free, baby, I can't stay  
I got to, got to get away  
Yeah, turn me loose, baby  
  
Listen here, baby  
Women here a women there  
Try to keep me in a plastic cage  
But they don't realize  
That it's so easy to break, break  
  
Yeah, but a sometimes  
Sometimes I can feel my heart  
Kinda gettin' hot  
That's when I gotta move  
Before I get caught  
You gotta understand  
  
Yeah, and that's why  
You can't hold me down  
I don't want to be tied down  
I gotta move on, hey  
  
Stone free, to do what I please baby  
Stone free, to ride the breeze  
Stone free, baby, I can't stay  
I got to, got to, get away  
So relax your grip  
  
Gotta break free  
Gotta break free  
Gotta break free  
And ride the breeze  
  
Gotta break free  
Gotta break free  
Do what I please  
Do what I please  
  
Stone free, to ride the breeze  
Stone free, to do what I please  
Stone free, hey I can't stay  
Stone free  
I got to get away  
  
Stone free, hey I'm gone, baby  
Stone free, don't try to hold me back baby  
Stone free, go on down the highway  
Stone free
