My god sits in the back of the limousine  
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane  
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine  
My god's a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene  
  
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype  
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right  
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me  
I play a game  
It's called insincerity  
  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers, Inc.  
Starfuckers  
  
I am every fucking thing and just a little more  
I sold my soul but don't you dare call me a whore  
And when I suck you off not a drop will go to waste  
It's really not so bad you know once you get past the taste, yeah  
(Ass kisser)  
  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers, Inc.  
Starfuckers  
  
All our pain  
How did we ever get by without you?  
You're so vain  
I bet you think this song is about you  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
  
Now I belong I'm one of the chosen ones  
Now I belong I'm one of the beautiful ones
