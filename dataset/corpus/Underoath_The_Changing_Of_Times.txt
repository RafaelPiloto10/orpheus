Never expected it to arrive so soon  
But as the night drifted on  
It came time to say goodbye  
Turning your back and walking away  
This cold winter morning is all that remains  
Why couldn't you tell me to my face  
Instead of hiding until I lost faith  
A heart gets broken as a life gets set free  
And all I asked was love me  
Years passed, seasons changed and I waited  
(Hate time to say goodbye, hate time)  
Soon after was the pain  
That would never reach you  
You've gotten over me  
But it seems I'll never get over you  
On me I place this blame  
Regrets  
Praying heaven will open wide  
And hold you tight  
As for me, I'll be alright  
This impact you would have  
The songs I'd write  
Dreams or you changing your mind  
Anything to pass the time  
But for now  
I hope you can hear me as I cry  
I love you and goodbye
