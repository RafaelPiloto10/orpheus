Down at the best spot  
Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop  
The spot's hot and everybody nervous  
That's when the blue car served us  
Oh why did fools had to let loose  
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce  
Big Tom had to push us  
13 niggas runnin' straight to the bushes  
For they gats so they could draw down  
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down  
Not known why I dropped out  
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out  
So now I gotta jet  
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin' wet  
Tryin' to see if we got him  
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom  
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out  
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out  
  
Woke up in the back of a tray  
On my way, to MLK  
That the county hospital jack  
Where niggas die over a little scratch  
Still sittin' in the trauma center  
In my back is where the bullet entered  
Yo nurse I'm gettin' kind of warm  
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form  
Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees  
Then I heard "freeze nigger don't move"  
Yo, I didn't do a thing  
Didn't want to go out like my man Rodney King  
Still got gaffled  
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel  
Now I'm handcuffed  
Being asked information on my gang affiliation  
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes  
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime  
  
I need to see a MD  
And y'all motherfuckers giving me the third degree  
Look at the waiting room  
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room  
Nobody gettin' help  
Since we poor  
The hospital move slow  
Now I'm laid out  
People steppin' over me to get closer to the tv  
Just like a piece of dog shit  
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet  
One hour done passed  
Done watched two episodes of MASH  
And when I'm almost through  
They call my name and put me on ICU  
Halfway dead  
No respect and handcuffed to the bed  
Now the trauma starts  
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart  
So I begin the ass kissin'  
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician  
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103  
Only got a band-aid and an IV  
That's when I start cussin'  
Police steady askin' me who did the bustin'  
  
Why oh why can't I get help  
'Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self  
Too many black bodies the hospital housin'  
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000
