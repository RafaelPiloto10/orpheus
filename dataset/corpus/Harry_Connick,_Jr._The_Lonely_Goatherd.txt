High on a hill was a lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Loud was the voice of the lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
Folks in a town that was quite remote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Lusty and clear from the goatherd's throat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
O ho lay dee odl lee o, o ho lay dee odl ay  
O ho lay dee odl lee o, lay dee odl lee o lay  
  
A prince on the bridge of a castle moat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Men on a road with a load to tote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
Men in the midst of a table d'hote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Men drinking beer with the foam afloat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
One little girl in a pale pink coat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
What a duet for a girl and goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
Ummm (um)

One little girl in a pale pink coat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hoo hoo  
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo  
  
Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard
