It's just a day like any other day  
A beautiful day for an accident, let's say  
Yes it's just a day, like any other day  
Just one step closer to the end of the buffet  
La la la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting to die  
  
Now it's a good time for a tasty glass of wine  
Let's not burden our minds with carbon dioxide  
And everyone hurry, don't sit and abide  
Yes, everyone stand up, we're running out of time  
La la la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting here to die  
  
Look what a terrible mess that we've made  
The sun beats us down as we search for the shade  
And, yes, it is true, death is everyone's fate  
But we've made it this far, it's time to celebrate  
La la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting here to die  
La la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting here to die
