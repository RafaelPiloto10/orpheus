Jesus, I know I've neglected to do  
The little things, the big things You wanted me to  
I've let You down, Jesus, that's not hard to see  
Jesus, oh, Jesus, don't give up on me  
  
Stand by me Jesus, forgive me somehow  
If there's any hope left, don't leave me now  
I might be worth saving, I'm trying to be  
Jesus, oh, Jesus, don't give up on me  
  
It's late I know and I've made You wait  
But don't turn the light out, don't lock the gate  
Forgiveness and patience, that's all I need  
Jesus, oh, Jesus, don't give up on me  
  
Stand by me Jesus, forgive me somehow  
If there's any hope left, please don't leave me now  
I might be worth saving, I'm trying to be  
Jesus, oh, Jesus, don't give up on me  
Jesus, oh, Jesus, don't give up on me
