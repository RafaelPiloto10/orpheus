Probably get it wrong just to get it right, girl  
Your probably gonna move, But I caught you now  
Now Ill just have to bow down now  
Cause I love the way you move me  
I love the way you move me  
  
I like most liquor, but I don't like gin  
Don't always like the skin I'm in  
Where were gonna go, I want to start again  
But I love the way you move me  
I love the way you move me  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
Just remember, I love the way you love me  
I love the way you move me  
  
I'm not all there, I'm a faithful sinner  
I might get lost, but Ill be home for dinner  
If God don't like me, he can hand me to hell  
But I love the way you love me girl  
I love the way you move me  
  
I pray to heaven to keep my place  
Till I look to the mirror and saw the Devils face  
And Id be a dog, for a tail to chase  
But I love the way you kiss me baby  
I love the way you talk to me  
I love the way you talk to me  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
The way you move me  
  
(Jam)  
  
Not coming home till the good days gone  
Working as hard, as the day is long  
Working men watch me, when I get home  
Cause I love the way you talk baby  
I love the way you move  
  
Oh ah, ah ah Yeah  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
Well remember  
All the freaks are on parade  
I wanna fill my belly, so I gotta get paid  
Doesn't everyone deserve to have the good life  
Don't always work out  
Cry cry baby, if you must  
Just remember  
  
I love the way you love me girl.  
I love the way you move.
