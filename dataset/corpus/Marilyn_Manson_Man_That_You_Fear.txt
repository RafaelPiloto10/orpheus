The ants are in the sugar  
The muscles atrophied  
We're on the other side, the screen is us and we're T. V.  
Spread me open,  
Sticking to my pointy ribs  
Are all your infants in abortion cribs  
I was born into this  
Everything turns to shit  
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear  
Pray until your number,  
Asleep from all your pain,  
Your apple has been rotting  
Tomorrow's turned up dead  
I have it all and I have no choice but to  
I'll make everyone pay and you will see  
You can kill yourself now  
Because you're dead  
In my mind  
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear  
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,  
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars  
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear  
Pray your life was just a dream  
The cut that never heals  
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream  
(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)  
Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed  
Someone had to go this far  
I was born into this  
Everything turns to shit  
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear  
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,  
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars  
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear  
Pray your life was just a dream  
The cut that never heals  
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream  
The world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream  
There's no one left for you
