I saw you standing on the street below  
Outside my window surrounded by a glow  
You were a young man troubled hadn't found its way  
You were smiling, that's all you had to say  
I thought I saw you  
Pennsylvania  
  
The streets were busy, the cafes and the bars  
People laughing, the flash of cars  
The neon tower like a fist up in the sky  
All that power like a spit in heaven's eye  
I thought I saw you  
Pennsylvania  
I thought I saw you  
Pennsylvania  
  
A bell is ringing in the courthouse square  
Rusted angels floating everywhere  
St. Michael singing to the spirits passing by  
To blacked out windows and the silence there inside  
I thought I heard you  
Pennsylvania  
I thought I saw you  
  
The alley in the rain  
The hotel by a train  
The well known ghosts remain  
  
Thought I felt you  
You in Pennsylvania
