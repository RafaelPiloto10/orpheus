I got your letter today  
And I miss you all so much here  
I can't wait to see you all  
And I'm counting the days here  
  
I still believe that there's gold  
At the end of the world  
And I'll come home to Illinois  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
It is so hard and it's cold here  
And I'm tired of taking orders  
And I miss old Rockford town  
Up by the Wisconsin border  
  
What I miss, you won't believe  
Shovelling snow and raking leaves  
And my plane will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
I close my eyes every night  
And I dream that I can hold you  
  
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys  
'Bout what it means to be a soldier  
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel  
'Bout all the blood that's been spilled  
Will god on this throne  
Get me back home  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
You can't deny, the other side  
Don't want to die anymore then we do  
What I'm trying to say is don't they pray  
To the same god that we do?  
  
And tell me how does god choose  
Whose prayers does he refuse?  
Who turns the wheel  
Who throws the dice  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
I'm not fighting, for justice  
I am not fighting, for freedom  
I am fighting, for my life  
And another day in the world here  
  
I just do what I've been told  
We're just the gravel on the road  
And only the lucky ones come home  
On the day after tomorrow  
  
And the summer, it too will fade  
And with it brings the winter's frost dear  
And I know we too are made  
Of all the things that we have lost here  
  
I'll be 21 today  
I been saving all my pay  
And my plane will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow  
And my plane it will touch down  
On the day after tomorrow
