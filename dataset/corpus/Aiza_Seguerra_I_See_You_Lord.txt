I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
In all the lovely things  
So fine and true  
I see you in the beauty  
Of the flowers and the rain  
I see you between the lines  
Of a sweet refrain  
I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
Even when I'm lonely and in pain  
I see you in the beauty of the stars at night  
I see you in my life  
I feel alright  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
In the smile of a baby  
Sweet and true  
I can see you in the eyes  
Of my very best friends  
I see you in these bonds  
Just like your love that never ends  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I pray...  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray...  
I see you Lord...
