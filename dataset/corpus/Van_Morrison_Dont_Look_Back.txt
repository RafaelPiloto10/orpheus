Don't look back to the days of yesteryear,  
You cannot live on in the past,  
Don't look back.  
  
And I've known so many people  
That still try to live on in the past,  
Don't look back, oh no.  
  
And if I could call back all those days of yesteryear,  
I would never grow old and I'd never be poor,  
But darlin', those days are gone, oh yeah.  
  
Stop dreaming  
And live on in the future,  
But darlin', don't look back, oh no,  
Don't look back, oh
