I'm broken, but no one knows  
I'm just a poser, but I've brainwashed the world  
No one will ever know how much of a poser I really am  
  
'Cause I'm punk! I really am, watch me strum my guitar  
I'm punk hear me roar! I'm gonna break my guitar  
Now watch me as I sing my song  
  
I sit hear singing my wannabe punk songs  
They are really popish songs but soon they will be punk  
'Cause I'm cool like that  
'Cause I'm such a punk rawker!  
  
'Cause I'm sew punk! I really am watch me strum my guitar  
I'm punk hear me roar I'm gonna break my guitar  
Now watch me as I sing my song  
  
I used to be a country singer  
A cheerleader popular gurl  
I never really liked all this punk rawk stuff  
But I wanted to break free and be cool and start trends  
  
But it's all good, 'cause I'm just so punkie!
