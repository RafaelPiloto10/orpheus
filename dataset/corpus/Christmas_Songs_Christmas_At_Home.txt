(Rita Macneil)  
  
Memories of walking home  
From the Christmas party in the falling snow  
Exchanging gifts, exchanging smiles  
Hanging pine cones in the hall  
  
[Chorus:]  
Merry Christmas meant lots of whispering  
Special feelings to bridge the difference  
All the years we came together  
For Christmas at home  
  
And the radio played in the distance  
O Night, O Holy Night  
  
Memories of old Jack Frost  
Frozen pictures upon the glass  
Changing right before your eyes  
With a warm breath from the happy child  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Memories of walking home  
From the Christmas party in the falling snow  
Exchanging gifts, exchanging smiles  
Hanging pine cones in the hall  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And the radio played in the distance  
O Night, O Holy Night
