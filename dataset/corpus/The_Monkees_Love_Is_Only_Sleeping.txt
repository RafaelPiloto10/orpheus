She looked at me  
And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see  
Then she turned away and said,  
"Once I loved, but love is dead"  
And I whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
  
She said, "I cannot cry  
And I cannot give or feel or even try"  
And her voice was hard and cold  
Then her sweet young face looked old  
And I whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
  
Through the endless days and nights  
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)  
Through the endless days and nights  
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow  
Love was sleeping, sleeping  
  
She looked at me  
And her smiling tears were warm and sweet and free  
And the moonlight kissed her eyes  
As it mingled with our sighs  
And she whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
And she whispered, "Sometimes love is only sleeping"  
Only sleeping
