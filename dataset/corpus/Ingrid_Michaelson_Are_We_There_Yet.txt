They say that home is where the heart is  
I guess I haven't found my home  
And we keep driving round in circles  
Afraid to call this place our own  
  
And are we there yet?  
  
They say there's linings made of silver  
Folded inside each raining cloud  
Well, we need someone to deliver  
Our silver lining now  
  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
Home, home, home  
Home, home, home  
  
They say you're really not somebody  
Until somebody else loves you  
Well, I am waiting to make somebody  
Somebody soon  
  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
Home, home, home  
Home, home, home  
  
Where you will lie on the rug  
While I play with the dog  
And it won't be too much  
'Cause this is too much  
'Cause this is too much for me to hold  
This is too much for me to hold  
  
Home, home, home  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
  
Home, home, home  
Home, home, home, home  
  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there yet?  
And are we there?
