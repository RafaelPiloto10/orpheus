When the lights go down and the music gets pretty  
Get that cheek-to-cheek look in your eye  
Little boy, go, better grab your honey  
Girl, you'd better grab your guy  
It's time for dream, dream dancing  
Dream, dream dancing.  
  
Out on the dance floor everybody's all alone  
Just squeeze my hand and then let's close our eyes  
And listen to the man play on the saxophone  
As we swerve cross the floor, just there, stars in the sky  
Dream, dream dancing  
Dream, dream dancing.  
  
Close your eyes, hold me tight  
Let the night last forever (repeat).  
And I don't mind if the sun never shines  
And I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
As long as we are ... Dream, dream dancing  
Dream, dream dancing.  
  
When the joint shuts down  
And I'm still feeling up  
We go on home for a little cosy cover  
For our favorite station on the radio  
We'll be dancing close  
We'll be dancing slow.  
  
Dream, dream dancing ...
