And if you hold on through the night  
I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll sing you love songs  
And hold you tight  
And this is what I'll do  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same  
  
And like a seed  
That's blessed by the sun  
A rose will come to you  
And as the song bird  
Flies through the sky  
He sings his song for you  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same  
Always be the same  
  
And if your colors all run dry  
I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll bring a rainbow to your eyes  
Yes this is what I'll do  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same  
  
And if you hold on through the night  
I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll sing you love songs  
And hold you tight  
And this is what I'll do  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same
