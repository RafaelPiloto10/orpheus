You'll be so far out of control  
You know, the ones you saved  
  
Look in my eye cause somehow you  
You don't realize what I made  
  
You can't run away from me  
Don't deny your blind believers  
And hide your Devil's keeper  
  
Take your love away from me  
'Cause I will blind your heathen reason  
And ride us on your broken wings for love  
  
True we are disciples lost  
You know the promise you made  
Look in my eyes and tell me why  
You realize the price that you'll pay?  
  
Number nine, number nine, number nine  
I'm still inside of  
The nine asylums  
Am I Messiah?  
  
You're the only God they know  
  
What are you running from  
Wasn't this enough  
Aren't you satisfied?  
They're all at your feet  
The Lord to sheep  
Oh, are you sanctified?
