Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Well, the moon still in the sky  
An' the sleep still in you eye  
But when you hear me sing  
You better make dem hammers ring  
Wake up and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Well, you had a big time last night  
And some of your heads are tight  
But when I call this roll, please Lord  
I don't want to miss a soul  
So get up and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
When you break dem one by one  
But man you just begun  
'Cause today, I tell you something new  
You gotta break dem two by two  
So come on and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Well, I tell you man, if you good  
You better chop dat stone like wood  
Then tomorrow gonna be a big day  
You get another shilling in you pay  
'Cause from sun to sun you gotta stick  
And don't tell me 'bout you sick  
I want you to do your best  
To night you better let them women rest  
So you can get up and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy  
Got to break that stone
