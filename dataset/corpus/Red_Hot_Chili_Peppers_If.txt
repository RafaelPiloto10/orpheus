And if I had a clue I'd know exactly  
What to do  
If I were the wiser of the two  
  
And if I saw it all so clear  
I'd write it down and bend your ear  
If I were the clearer of the two  
  
We could take a walk into the  
Canyons of Fifth avenue  
Sing and dance, just to name a few  
  
All I do  
All I do  
  
And if I heard the angels sing I'd  
Sing it back to you and bring the  
Sound of heaven ringing just for you  
  
And if I saw the sun fall down  
I'd pick it up and make a crown  
One that was a perfect fit for you  
  
We could take a walk  
Into the apple orchard by the school  
We could make a little residue  
  
We could find a place to stay  
A secret little hide away  
Spend a little time inside of you  
  
All I do  
All I do  
  
All eyes  
All eyes  
All eyes on you  
  
All I do  
All I do  
All I do  
All I do
