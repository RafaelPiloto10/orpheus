Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else  
But nobody's lonesome for me  
Ev'rybody's thinkin' 'bout somebody else  
But nobody thinks about me  
When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die  
I bet I'll have to go and hire me someone to cry  
Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else  
nobody is lonesome for me.  
  
Ev'rybody's longin' for somebody else  
But nobody's lonesome for me  
Ev'rybody's dreamin' about somebody else  
But nobody dreams about me  
All I need is a bride who want's a big-hearted groom  
I wouldn't care if she come ridin' in on a broom  
Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else  
No-bod-o-dy lonesome for me.  
  
Ev'rybody's pinin' for somebody else  
But nobody's lonesome for me  
Ev'rybody's crazy 'bout somebody else  
But nobody's crazy 'bout me  
Oh, I shined up my shoes and then I slicked down my hair  
Put on my Sunday suit, but I ain't goin' nowhere  
Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else  
But nobody's lonesome for me.  
  
Ev'rybody's yearnin' for somebody else  
But nobody's lonesome for me  
Ev'rybody's fallin' for somebody else  
But nobody's fallin' for me  
Now I ain't had a kiss since I fell out of my crib  
It looks to me like I been cheated out of my rib  
Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else  
No-bod-o-dy lonesome for me.
