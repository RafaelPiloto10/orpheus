You can't believe things you see and read  
The Soviet threat  
Our pseudo enemy  
What's scaring me?  
Our foreign policy  
To make the world safe for business  
Call it democracy  
  
Our human nature, it's all the same  
We spend our lives in the pursuit of happiness  
So stop the hate, open the iron gate  
It's our destiny to make the cold war history  
  
You think I give a shit  
If you're a socialist  
If you're a capitalist  
We've all got to exist  
On this planet with nowhere to run  
The millions of brainwashed must open their eyes  
We are one  
  
With us over here and them over there  
Barbed wire borders are going nowhere
