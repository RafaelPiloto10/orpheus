(original by Flamin' Groovies)  
  
Shake Some Action  
I will find a way  
To get to you some day.  
Oh, but I, babe,  
I'm so afraid I'll fall,  
Yeah. Now can't you hear me call?  
Shake some action's what I need  
To let me bust out at full speed.  
I'm sure that's all you need  
To make it all right.  
It's taken me so long  
To get where I belong  
Oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah.  
For I will make you pay. (refrain)  
If you don't dig what I say  
Then I will go away.  
And I won't come back this again.  
No. 'Cause I don't need a friend.  
(refrain)  
(guitar solo again)
