Hooded figures, clouded skies  
Fires burn within their eyes  
Pentagram with baphomet midnight strikes  
Goat of mendes lifts his head  
Summons up the living dead  
Virgin flesh lies tied and bound  
Hail satanas  
  
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.  
Scream for mercy cry and repent satan claims your soul  
Sacrifice, sacrifice, oh so nice, sacrifice  
  
Candles glow on alters bare  
A virgin's death is needed there  
Sacrifice to Lucifer my master  
Bring the chalice raise the knife  
Welcome to my sacrifice  
Plunge the dagger in her breast  
I insist  
  
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.  
Limbs weaken limbs fly away demons rejoice  
Sacrifice, sacrifice, name your price, sacrifice  
  
Death is swift 'neath satan's sword  
All the same young and old  
Life means nothing to my lord  
Drink from chalice warm and sweet  
Virgin's heart final beat  
Lightning strikes virgin dies  
Satan smiles  
  
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.  
The moon is black and the witches dance, heaven is denied  
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
