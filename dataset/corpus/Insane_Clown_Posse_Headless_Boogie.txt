Headless Boogie  
[Violent J]  
It's Friday night, dark, scary  
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery  
And its foggy, cold and smoggy  
Hear a dog, a howling doggy  
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun  
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one  
So I watch my back, and what's that  
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback  
Better run, hide, quick, fast  
He's coming for my ass with a shovel  
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit  
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit  
Took a fall, deeper than six foot  
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door  
Into a whole new world of stiffs  
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks  
Club lights, sounds, bass  
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face  
And what I saw next then really took me  
Uh, they did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Hey yo, I heard that you died  
Fuck that, it's time to get live  
Dead bodies let's all take a ride  
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)  
"Oh yeah, we dug up the finest  
Bitches in the graveyard  
So come on down  
And if you ain't come to get your funk out  
Then get the fuck out, bitch"  
[Violent J]  
They all stand straight and swing to the side  
No heads, but they feet still glide  
Take a step back, twist and dive  
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)  
No heads, but they all funky  
And drunk, drinking old Spunky  
Don't be shy, everyone's able  
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table  
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off  
If you're dead, your legs might fall off  
The whole time I can't believe  
I can't conceive, I don't want to leave  
I'm kicking into a freak with no head  
No face, but the rest is straight  
She's with it, I hit it like a G  
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me  
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein  
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine  
Dead stiffs coming through the door  
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor  
I'm getting drunk, I want to be down, what's up  
I want to be the headless clown  
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw  
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"Hey yo, fuck that voodoo moshing, bitch  
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos  
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off  
So you get grave dancing!!!"  
[Chorus (4x)]
