Jimmy Buffett  
Fun tickets in my pocket, visions in my brain  
Grand father always told me it I went down  
I might never come back again  
  
I studied the language tapes  
And I read all the books  
Still nothing prepared me for my  
Very First Look  
  
(CHORUS 1)  
It was my First Look  
Baby that's all it took  
Was my First Look  
Around  
  
I think I want to go flyin'  
But I don't want to leave the ground  
So I'll just cruise on my landing gear  
And taxi round Rio town  
Up to the mountain, down to the sea  
Take me to Leblon where the samba queen  
Waits for me  
  
(CHORUS 2)  
It was my First Look  
That's when I swallowed the hook  
On my First Look  
Around  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voce no kier queo insisto  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voca no kier queo insista  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica  
  
(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)  
  
Six days later I was felling like a missing link  
When my friends told me hey Jimmy  
It must have been the hoodlum drink  
Now it's time for siestas  
And a belly full of rice and beans  
And figure if I'm brave enough  
To repeat the whole crazy scene  
  
(CHORUS 3)  
On my First Look  
That's when I swallowed the hook  
On my First Look around  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voce no kier queo insista  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica  
  
Amora premiera vista  
Voca no kier queo insista  
Amora premiera vista  
Reacion quimica
