Stiff competition  
If I go up-you take me higher  
Stiff competition  
And when I'm down, you take me higher  
There's stiff competition all over the world  
I screw you, you screw me, they screw us  
  
Here we go again  
Oh, but we have so much fun, so much fun  
When we're together  
When we're together  
When we're together-now  
I looked hard in your eyes  
It was love at first sight  
  
It took me minutes, you're still waiting  
Waiting for your turn, you turn  
It won't be long  
Stiff competition  
I work hard, every day of my life  
  
Stiff competition  
Get it up, you take me higher  
Stiff competition  
All over the world  
The more I get, the more I like it  
The bigger they are, the harder they fall  
  
Again  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition
