Hit it!  
  
Everything I've ever dreamed of  
Has begun to fade to black  
Oh, I don't know where I ever lost love  
Or where to go now to get it back  
  
I'm a desperate, lonely child and I don't have enough  
I've come to know the rules and laws and scriptures of love  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it don't exist, you make it!  
If it ain't broke, break it!  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it's gone to sleep, you wake it!  
If it ain't broke, break it!  
  
Gimme some words I can live by  
Gimme commandments to know  
Gimme some fables and proverbs  
You gotta gimme some signs where to go  
  
There are designated angels who just might save your soul, no!  
They give me words to live by, and that's all that I know  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it don't exist, you make it!  
If it ain't broke, break it!  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it's all gone bad, forsake it!  
If it ain't broke, break it  
  
There are designated angels who just might save your soul  
They give me words to live by, and that's all that I know  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it don't exist, you make it!  
If it ain't broke, break it!  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it's gone to sleep, you wake it!  
If it ain't broke, break it!  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it don't exist, you make it!  
If it ain't broke, break it!  
  
If it ain't real, fake it!  
If it ain't yours, take it!  
If it's all gone bad, forsake it!  
And if it ain't broke, break it
