My mind is clearer now  
At last, all too well I can see  
Where we all soon will be  
  
If you strip away  
The myth from the man  
You will see where we all soon will be  
  
Jesus, You've started to believe  
The things they say of you  
You really do believe  
This talk of God is true  
  
And all the good You've done  
Will soon be swept away  
You begun to matter more  
Than the things You say  
  
Listen, Jesus I don't like what I see  
All I ask is that You listen to me  
And remember, I've been Your right hand man all along  
You have set them all on fire  
They think they've found the new Messiah  
And they'll hurt You when they find they're wrong  
  
I remember when this whole thing began  
No talk of God then, we called You a man  
And believe me, my admiration for You hasn't died  
But every word You say today, is twisted 'round some other way  
And they'll hurt You if they think You've lied  
  
Nazareth's your famous Son  
Should have stayed a great unknown  
Like His father carving wood  
He'd have made good, tables, chairs and oaken chests  
Would have suited Jesus best  
He'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm  
  
Listen Jesus, do You care for Your race?  
Don't You see we must keep in our place?  
We are occupied, have You forgotten how put down we are?  
I am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud  
And they'll crush us if we go too far, if we go too far  
  
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give  
Please remember that I want us to live  
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour  
  
All Your followers are blind, too much heaven on their minds  
It was beautiful but now it's sour, yes it's all gone sour  
God Jesus, it's all gone sour  
  
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give  
Come on, come on, listen to me  
Won't you listen to me?
