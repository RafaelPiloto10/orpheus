Rubber ducky, you're the one  
You make bathtime lots of fun  
Rubber ducky I am awfully fond of you  
Rubber Ducky, joy of joys  
When I squeeze you, you make noise  
Rubber ducky you're my very best friend - it's true  
Oh, every day when I make my way to the tubby  
I find a little fella who's cute and yellow and chubby  
Rubber dubber ducky  
Rubber ducky you're so fine  
And I'm lucky that you're mine  
Rubber ducky I am awfully fond of  
Rubber duck I wish I had a whole pond of  
Rubber ducky I am awfully fond of you
