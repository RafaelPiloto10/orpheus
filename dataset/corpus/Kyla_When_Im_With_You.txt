I like what I see my friend  
All our moments and all of the time  
We spend  
The way that you make me feel  
When you know my heart wants  
Something  
I know we could last till the bitter end  
But only if we'll go hand in hand  
Cause I know how you make me feel  
And you know what it is, that something  
  
[Refrain:]  
It's so amazing baby  
Been loving you like crazy  
So I thank you for your heart  
And you should know  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm with you  
I don't feel lonely  
When I'm with you  
Heaven is right here in your arms  
When I'm with you, my one and only  
I'm in paradise, when I'm with you  
  
Forever and another day  
That's what people always say  
A promise too often broken  
But I know we will find a way  
  
Cause we've got something  
A lot of people search for their whole life for  
And it will never, never, never end  
Coz I just want you more and more  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
When I'm with you  
I don't feel lonely  
When I'm with you  
Heaven is right here in your arms  
When I'm with you, my one and only  
I'm in paradise, when I'm with you  
  
You make everyday to me  
Another dream come true  
I'm just so in love with you baby  
It's more than physical  
It's a spiritual thing  
When I'm with you  
My heart wants to sing  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
When I'm with you  
I don't feel lonely  
When I'm with you  
Heaven is right here in your arms  
When I'm with you, my one and only  
I'm in paradise, when I'm with you
