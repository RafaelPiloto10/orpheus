'Round 'Ole' Baugh Road it's a great place kids to grow  
Some grow up and move away  
Most of us decide to stay  
'Round the 'Ole' Baugh Road  
  
Hard working mom and dad  
Gve us things that they never had  
I our corner of the world  
Romance is slow for the boys and girls  
'Round the 'Ole' Baugh Road  
  
The neighborhood still looks the same  
Just new kids with the same old names  
My Baugh Road's in a southern state  
Your's may be anywhere, you. S. A.  
Look 'round 'Ole' Baugh Road  
  
I see the kids on 'Ole' Baugh Road  
I see the glory of the future glow  
Look to the Heavens and give a shout  
Like my daddy did when he started out  
  
'Round, 'round, 'round the 'Ole' Baugh Road  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
  
The 'Ole' Baugh Road  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
'Round, 'round, 'round
