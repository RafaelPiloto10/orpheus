The crowd without a face  
Begins to fill the space  
In the arena  
Flashlights at his feet  
The lion from the street  
Awaits the Christians  
Blinding flash of light  
A single strobe ignites the night  
  
The smoke begins to rise  
A sea of staring eyes  
Gaze on the sunburst  
His weapon at his side  
He flashes it with pride  
Before his legions  
Fires begin to rage  
And they engulf the stage  
All right  
Bring on the night  
  
He's in complete control  
He's stepping proud and bold  
And everything he touches  
Turns to gold  
He's got girls by the score  
He's got 'em screaming for more  
But when they get too close  
He bars the door  
  
He makes his great escape  
Leaves them in his wake  
Without a warning  
The ritual is done  
A night no longer young  
Fades into morning  
The sun begins to rise  
As he begins to close his eyes
