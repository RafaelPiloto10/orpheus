Wait you've gone too far  
Who for God's sake who for God's sake  
Who is it you think you are  
You know you should, should, shoulda known better  
Than take a chance  
If you can't feel the rhythm  
If you can't feel the rhythm don't dance!  
  
You can't run  
You can't hide  
On the wings of a dove  
Or behind your vicious pride (you better come through it)  
  
Hey  
You gotta silver tongue  
You use it and you use it  
And you'll get us all hung  
You know you should, should, shoulda known better  
Than take a chance  
'Cause if you can't feel the rhythm  
If you can't feel the rhythm don't dance!  
  
You can't run  
You can't hide  
On the wings of a dove  
Or behind your vicious pride (you better come through it)  
  
Show me show me some emotion  
Show me show me some emotion
