The future is on fire  
Of a dying breed.  
Don't understate our relevance,  
We're the eyes and the walls  
And we witness the vultures feed.  
  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
(Oh)  
Stay wide awake.  
Stay wide awake.Yeah!  
(Oh)  
Make haste 'cause predators precede.  
(Oh)  
Stay wide awake.  
Stay wide awake.Yeah!  
(Oh)  
While all the vultures feed.  
  
Like angles in a sphere,  
Of our own design.  
No more perpetual innocence.  
With words we make shapes,  
And our angles can align.  
  
Yeah  
  
And our appetite's careless and menacing.  
It humbles me  
We breathe softly out with the predator?  
Such is a sight to see.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Stay wide awake  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
While all the vultures feed
