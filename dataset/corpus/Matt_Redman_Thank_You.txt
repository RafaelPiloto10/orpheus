Thank you, thank you for the blood that you shed  
standing in its blessing we sing these freedom songs  
thank you thank you for the battle you won  
standing in your victory we sing salvation songs  
we sing salvations song  
  
You have opened a way to the father  
where before we could never have come  
jesus count us as yours now forever  
as we sing these freedom songs  
  
We sing of all you've done  
we sing of all you've done  
we sing of all you've done for us  
won for us, paid for us
