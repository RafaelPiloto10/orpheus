[Kelly]  
There are times I swear I know  
Your near. But then again your  
Heart can play so many tricks on  
You but I still wish that I could  
Be  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Where you are  
Where we had danced toghether  
Where you are  
Will be kissing under the stars  
Tonight only than will I be where  
You are.  
  
[Kalan]  
And I can see your face but  
It hurts everytime I do cause you  
My love ....  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Where you are  
Where we had danced toghether  
Where you are  
Will be kissing under the stars  
Tonight only than will I be where  
You are.
