What happened to you  
You're not the same  
Something inside your head made a violent change  
It's call it religion  
You're full of shit  
Was she really worth it?  
She cost you your life  
She'll never leave your side  
She's gonna be your wife  
It's in yor head  
Filler  
You call it romance  
You're full of shit  
Your brain is clay  
What's going on?  
You picked up a bible  
And now your gone  
It's in your head  
It's in your head  
It's in your head  
You call it religion  
You're full of lshit  
You never knew  
You never did  
You never will  
You call it religion  
You're full of shit
