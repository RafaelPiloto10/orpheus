I wasn't made to understand.  
I've given up my name, forgotten where I stand.  
Sometimes I don't know who I am. I used to feel so scared,  
I used to hold your hand.  
I'm so sick of playing favorites, sick of being scared.  
  
They would rather see you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
We are much less different than we know.  
Imaginary enemy, imaginary enemy!  
I would never leave you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy! (Ha!)  
  
I will not ever understand.  
Just how it got this way, and how it got so bad.  
You're not a part of what we need. There is no common ground.  
We hate what you believe.  
I'm so sick of playing favorites, sick of being scared.  
  
They would rather see you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
We are much less different than we know.  
Imaginary enemy, imaginary enemy!  
I would never leave you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
  
Who taught me to hate you, when I don't even know you?  
Who created the enemy?  
Who taught me to hate you, when I don't even know you?  
Who taught me to hate you, hate you, hate you!  
  
Who created the enemy!?  
  
Who created!?  
  
They would rather see you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
We are much less different than we know.  
Imaginary enemy, imaginary enemy!  
I would never leave you all alone.  
Imaginary enemy!  
  
Who created the enemy!?  
  
Who created!?
