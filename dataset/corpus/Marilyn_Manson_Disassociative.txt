I can tell you what they say in space  
That our earth is too grey  
But when the spirit is so digital  
The body acts this way  
That world aws killing me  
That world was killing me  
Disassociative  
  
The nervous systems down,  
the nervous systems down  
I know  
  
I can never get out of here  
I don't want to just float in fear  
A dead astronaut in space  
  
Sometimes we walk like  
we were shot through  
our heads, my love  
We write our song in space  
like we are already  
dead and gone  
Your world was killing me  
Your world was killing me  
Disassociative  
  
Your world was killing me  
Your world was killing me  
Disassociative  
  
I can never get out of here  
I don't want to just float in fear  
A dead astronaut in space  
  
The nervous systems down,  
the nervous systems down  
I know
