I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in  
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul  
He bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above  
And just a little talk with my Jesus made me whole  
(Now let us) have a little talk with Jesus (let us) tell him all about our
troubles  
(He will) hear our faintest cry (and we will) answer by and by  
(Now when you) feel a little prayer wheel turning  
(Then you'll) know a little fire is burning  
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus makes it right  
  
(Now let us) have a little talk  
  
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears  
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night  
I go to him in prayer he knows my every care  
And just a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right  
(Now let us) have a little talk  
(Makes it right)
