The day rolls in, the night rolls out  
Desire rules without a doubt  
The heart beats fast, you salivate  
And when you come, it won't be late  
I guess by now, you got the score  
A little taste you want it more  
From San Antone to Marrakesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have flesh  
You got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
From the day that Eve did Adam down to Romeo and Juliet  
Everybody gotta have  
The prince of lust has met his match  
The witch has brewed her baddest batch  
His sword is sharp and hard as stone  
Her cauldron begs for one more bone  
And so my love, this story's told  
From modern times to days of old  
From Boston, Mass to Bangladesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have  
Flesh - it's got me all soaking wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat, yeah  
From the Mississippi River  
To the highest mountain in Tibet  
Everybody gotta have  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing, the only thing, the only thing  
From a Sufi in a Rickshaw to a bimbo in a pink Corvette  
Everybody gotta have
