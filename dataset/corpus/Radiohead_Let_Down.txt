Transport, motorways and tramlines,  
Starting and then stopping,  
Taking off and landing,  
The emptiest of feelings,  
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles,  
And when it comes it's so, so, disappointing.  
  
Let down and hanging around,  
Crushed like a bug in the ground.  
Let down and hanging around.  
  
Shell smashed, juices flowing  
Wings twitch, legs are going,  
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel.  
One day, I am gonna grow wings,  
A chemical reaction,  
Hysterical and useless  
Hysterical and  
  
Let down and hanging around,  
Crushed like a bug in the ground.  
Let down and hanging around.  
  
Let down,  
Let down,  
Let down.  
  
You know, you know where you are with,  
You know where you are with,  
Floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back  
And one day, I am gonna grow wings,  
A chemical reaction, (You know where you are)  
Hysterical and useless (You know where you are)  
Hysterical and (You know where you are)  
  
Let down and hanging around,  
Crushed like a bug in the ground.  
Let down and hanging around.
