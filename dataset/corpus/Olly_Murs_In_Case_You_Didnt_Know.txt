Maybe you're out tonight  
With somebody else by your side  
Oh oh oh oh  
You forgot about me, yeah  
And I guess you're moving on  
You got sick of me like a song  
Oh oh oh oh  
That's playing on repeat  
  
While you're living the good life  
I feel a sharp knife  
Stabbing me straight through the heart  
  
You gotta know that I'm here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
Since you left I've been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh?  
  
So I dated other girls, yeah  
I tried everything in the world  
Oh oh oh oh  
To forget your face  
Why would anyone stick around  
When I get up screaming out  
At the worst time  
Your name  
  
That's while you're living the good life  
I feel a sharp knife  
Stabbing me straight through the heart  
  
You gotta know that I'm here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
Since you left I've been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh?  
  
Can you hear me when I say  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
  
Don't even know if you care  
That I'm waiting right here  
Unable to make one move  
Still waiting for you to call  
Banging my head against the wall  
I'm so hopeless without you  
  
I'm here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
Since you left I've been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh?  
  
Can you hear me when I say  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
In case you didn't know  
In case you didn't know
