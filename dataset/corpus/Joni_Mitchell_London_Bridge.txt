London Bridge is falling down  
Say the people in my town  
They're the ones who bring it down  
(It's true they've been for centuries,  
Walking by it and saying, you know,  
London Bridge really is falling down, poor thing,  
It just fell down in shame)  
My fair lady-o  
  
(Now maybe if someone would, encourage it a little bit)  
  
London Bridge is falling up  
Say the tea leaves in my cup  
Guess the cup is cracking up  
My fair lady-o  
  
London Bridge is up for sale  
Booze heads put my friend in jail  
Spent my bridge money on bail  
My fair lady-o  
(Sure would've like to have bought that bridge)  
(Couldn't let him go to jail)  
  
If the bridge belonged to me  
I would serve you tarts and tea  
Smiles, that's all the tolls would be  
(No grouchy people would be getting across at all)  
My fair lady-o  
  
On the bridge there stands a car  
Painted with peculiar flowers  
It's the Beatles' it's not ours  
(Guess they're looking at the bridge)  
(Hope they buy it)  
My fair lady-o  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
(Something like that)  
London Bridge is coming down  
Coming down on London Bridge  
Ice cubes melting in my fridge  
  
(They always, do you know those English fridges are terrible, they're always
melting things and ice cubes are dripping all over the floor)  
(And the vegetables are all rotten and your friend turns to you in her very
British way and she says: "You know I paid two bob for this. It smells a bit
peculiar doesn't it, but don't you think... well, we can serve it anyway" and
she does)  
Coming down on London Bridge  
Mutton rotting in my fridge  
Coming dow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow  
Coming-ming-ming-ming-ming-ming  
(A little electronic music there for your pleasure)  
Coming down on London Bridge  
My fair lady-o
