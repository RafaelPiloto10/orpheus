You've got to learn, to brighten up your ways  
Kick out your dull padded life  
There's much to know, and no doors in space  
They were only mirrors you imagined in your mind  
Now that you've got no place to go  
And you stand alone  
Know that there's just one place to be  
And it's in your soul, oh  
Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you  
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through  
Like morning meets the moon, my love will guide the way  
It's time to wipe your eyes not, and awake  
I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do  
I've come to take you over, then it's up to you  
  
Be like the light, in the shadows  
Throw down your mask and be real  
Don't wish to win, and don't mind to lose  
That was just a cycle like a squirrel in a wheel  
Now that you've got no place to look  
And you stand alone  
Know that's there's just one place to be  
And it is your home, oh  
Like fish that seek the water, the truth will come to you  
Like leaves upon the soil, they will find ways through  
Like flowers seek the sun, my love will guide the way  
It's time to wipe your eyes now, and awake.  
  
You say you're really with me but you only follow me around  
How much you love me yes,  
But I don't want the kind of love  
I have to sit down and count  
  
You think you're free and lucky but you're stuck behind a prison wall  
How well you know yourself  
But I see something else within you  
That you don't see at all  
You may give up your number, disowning all your wealth  
You may sell all the pieces, but you'll  
Never never never give up  
Yourself, oh no no no.  
  
Like drywood takes to fire the truth will come to you  
Like streams that seek the ocean they will find ways through  
Like morning meets the night's stars, my love will guide the way  
It's time to wipe your eyes not, and awake  
I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do  
I've come to take you over, then it's up to you.
