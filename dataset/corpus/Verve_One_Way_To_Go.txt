You've got to lift yourself up so high  
You can't see the ground  
You don't hear a sound  
You've got to move it up so slow  
You see it all  
You'll probably fall  
  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I don't know what I'll find  
  
You've got to move me up  
So high it hurts  
So high it burns  
But if you let me down  
Don't bother to call  
Just let me fall  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
I'd rather die than see you fly  
Than see you try  
  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind  
I don't know what I'll find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
It's like pushing locked doors to get in that mind  
I don't care what I find  
  
It's only one...  
  
One way to go  
One way to go  
  
One way to go  
One way to go
