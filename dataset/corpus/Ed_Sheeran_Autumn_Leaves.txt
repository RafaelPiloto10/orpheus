Another day another life  
Passes by just like mine  
It's not complicated  
  
Another mind  
Another soul  
Another body to grow old  
It's not complicated  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Another tear  
Another cry  
Another place for us to die  
It's not complicated  
  
Another love that's gone to waste  
Another light lost from your face  
It's complicated  
  
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Ooh how I miss you  
My symphony played the song that carried you out  
Ooh how I miss you  
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Touch down  
Like a seven four seven  
Or stay out and we'll live forever now
