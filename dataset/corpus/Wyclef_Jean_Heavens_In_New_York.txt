If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I wanna be  
Last day on earth  
  
I tell my momma don't cry I'll see my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Heavens in New York  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
First thing I'd do is go back in time take the twin towers, put it back in the
skyline  
Tell my girl two wrongs still don't make a right  
Make love for the last time under the candlelight  
Pick up my hommies at the gentleman club after that hit  
Club and Reminisce about the High School Days  
Man I sucked as a quarterback remember getting sacked man almost broke my back
yeah  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I wanna be  
Last day on earth I tell my girl don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tell the man get the people a tax break  
Kids stop shootin' I cant sing in no more ways  
I cant take the money with me so I caught a movie  
Favorite actress Angelina Jolie  
Favorite Singer has to be Marley  
Turn Up the Bass  
And move to his styling's  
Cant leave without reading my daughter a bedtime story the heavens is calling  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I want to be  
Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now  
Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Welcome to New York City  
Even though I walk through the Valley of Shadow of Death I fear No evil  
For you are with me so tell my loves ones please don't cry  
Cause if doves can fly so can I  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I want to be  
Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry I'm with my dad in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now  
Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even though I walk through the Valley of Shadow of Death I fear  
No evil for you are with me so  
Tell my loves ones please don't cry  
Cause if doves can fly so can I  
  
If it was my last day on earth  
I'd treat it like my first  
Go out the way I came in  
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity  
Live life to the fullest be what I want to be  
Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry I'm with my daddy in paradise  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now Heaven's in New York  
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk  
But for now  
Heaven's in New York  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
Welcome To  
New York City...  
Heaven's In New York City
