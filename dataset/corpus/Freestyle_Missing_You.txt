I've been through so much pain since you left me  
I just can't convince myself we're through  
Things have been said and done  
I guess it's over now you're gone  
  
It's true when they say that lovers come and go  
But deep in my heart I just want to let you know  
The love that we once shared is everything  
That there's nothing to compare  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
'Cause I'm missing you so bad  
Now that you're not by my side  
I guess you could say it's me  
Who's hurting so bad after all this time  
After all that we've been through  
Baby aren't you hurting too  
  
Now that I've lost the power to pretend  
I guess you could see right through me  
This yearning I can't explain  
Feeling I just cannot contain  
  
I know someday I'll get over you  
It just takes time and some getting used to  
Each day I'm feeling blue  
Every road leads me back to you  
  
'Cause I'm missing you so bad  
Now that you're not by my side  
I guess you could say it's me  
Who's hurting so bad after all this time  
After all that we've been through  
Baby I'm missing you so bad  
  
Now that you're not by my side  
I guess you could say it's me  
Who's hurting so bad after all this time  
After all that we've been through  
Baby aren't you hurting too
