I'm Forty-One, the moon is full,  
You make love very well.  
You touch me like I touch myself,  
I like you Mademoiselle.  
You're so fresh and you're so new,  
I do enjoy you, Miss.  
There's nothing I would rather do  
Than move around just like this  
But do I have to dance all night?  
But do I have to dance all night?  
Ooh tell me, Bird of Paradise,  
Do I have to dance all night?  
You never really have to tell me what  
You really think of me - alright.  
Let's say I'm doing fine,  
But do I have to dance all night?  
Do I have to dance all night? ...  
I learned this step a while ago.  
I had to practice it while everybody slept.  
I waited half my life for you, you know,  
I didn't even think that you'd accept.  
And here you are before me in the flesh  
Saying "Yes, yes, yes!"  
But do I have to dance all night? ...  
I learned this step a while ago ...  
But do I have to dance all night? ...
