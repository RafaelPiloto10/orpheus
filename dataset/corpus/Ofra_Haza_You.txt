Ooh  
  
Late in life  
You came to me  
And you put a sign  
On me  
Late in life  
What remained of you  
When you fell into  
A trap of lies  
  
You (ooh) You (ooh)  
You (ooh)  
Only you (ooh) You (ooh)  
You (ooh)  
All your love  
That I love  
All your love  
  
Ah  
  
Like a man  
Who plays the game  
As a healing  
For his pain  
You played your game  
Again and again  
Crazy, insane  
Deep in love  
  
You (ooh) You (ooh)  
You (ooh)  
Only you (ooh) You (ooh)  
You (ooh)  
All your love  
That I love  
All your love  
  
Yeah  
  
You (ooh) You (ooh)  
Only you (ooh)  
Only you (ooh) You (ooh)  
Only you (ooh) Only you (ooh)  
Only you (ooh) Only you  
All your love  
That I love  
All your love
