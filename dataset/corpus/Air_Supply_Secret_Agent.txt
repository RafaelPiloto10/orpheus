Well I've got friends in the states  
And I've got friends out in space  
When information's your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito  
  
(chorus)  
I love my trade,  
I've got my future made.  
I put my life on the line  
To save this country of mine  
And they reward me with love  
And see I have a good time.  
So all my moves must be fast  
'cause every day is my last  
A secret agent that's slow  
Almost certain to go.  
  
(chorus)  
I've got friends in the states  
I've got friends out in space  
When information's your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito.  
  
(chorus)
