Do you love me women , truly do ya?  
Can you feel this feeling going through ya?  
Are you of the mind that we should live together through this night?  
Or tell me you're my virgin queen and it may not be right.  
  
But don't make me say , i can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down  
Just thinking of your face and it won't be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside , stealing my pride  
I can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down 'cause you won't be around  
  
When all this world of ours is falling apart  
I'll keep on hanging on and fixing my heart  
'Cause ev'ryone is just like me they're praying in the sun  
And i may be that lucky man surviving when they're gone  
  
But don't make me say , i can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down  
Just thinking of your face and it won't be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside , stealing my pride  
I can't let you go  
And it's breaking me down 'cause you won't be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside , stealing my pride  
I can't let you , can't let you go  
And it's breaking my down 'cause you won't be around  
  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go  
Just look at me now , i can't let you go (fade out)
