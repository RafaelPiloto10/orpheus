On glory day we'll get the gifts of heaven up above  
All around you hope and joy, to find and fall in love  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
Feeling the wonder, of sun ,rain and thunder  
Unraveling life's mysteries, living to make history  
Free at last  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
Can you feel it  
  
Let dreamers dream and lovers leap  
I pray for you our souls to keep free at last...  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
Can you feel that maximum joy  
Rolling round like a brand new boy  
Rain and sunshine from heaven  
  
I will catch and keep you like a rainbow in my room  
And tie you to a star that's rising, dancing on the moon, on the moon  
  
Can you feel it...maximum joy...maximum joy
