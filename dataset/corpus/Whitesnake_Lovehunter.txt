I need a woman to treat me good  
And give me everything a good woman should  
Everyday and every night  
She'd be waiting on her brown-eyed boy  
To come and treat her right  
  
I'm a love hunter baby  
Sneaking up on you,  
I'm a love hunter baby  
Sneaking up on you  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
And use my tail on you  
  
In my time I've been a back door man,  
I've taken everything I could  
But, I've given all I can  
I don't want no woman  
To weep or moan,  
I'm looking for a sweet heartbreaker  
And I'm never gonna leave her alone  
  
I'm a love hunter baby  
Sneaking up on you,  
I'm a love hunter baby  
What you gonna do?  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
And use my tail on you  
  
I'm a love hunter baby  
Sneaking up on you,  
I'm a love hunter baby  
What you gonna do?  
I'm gonna give you all my loving  
And use my tail on you  
  
Cause I'm a love hunter baby,  
I'm a love hunter baby  
  
I'm a love hunter baby  
Sneaking up on you  
  
I'm sneaking up on you!
