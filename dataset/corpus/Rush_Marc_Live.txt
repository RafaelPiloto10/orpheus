[Marc Live]  
Woo! Ohhh.. Yeah.. Sink in  
Brand new.. Marc Live... Let's go!  
Rush, let's work, rush  
Rush, yo.. Rush  
Yo, check, check, yo  
  
Rush - jump all hot, jump off the whole top  
Jump off the roof 90 proof, listen  
Break up the floor, break up mad tours  
Shake up the state, shake like it's earthquake  
Break up the cake, break 'til it's daybreak  
Shut down the block, pay off corrupt cop  
Set up shop, set off the whole block  
It's all good, yo it's all hood listen  
Stop it - I know this shit sound mad good  
It's supposed to, niggaz I told you  
Chickens I told you, you brand new  
It's a, new me yo it's not you, you old news  
Take off the top, blow past the hot spot  
Everybody look, get chicks took  
Hit the lick quick, get the bricks quick  
The chain so sick, rims so thick, c'mon!  
  
[Chorus - repeat 2X]  
Rush - it's the cars, the clothes, the dough  
Rush - it's the bar, the clubs, the 'dro  
Rush - it's the girls, the diamonds, the blow  
Rush - it's the street, it's gangsta, so heat  
  
[Marc Live]  
Rush - okay, yo I'ma make sense of it (tell 'em)  
The rush, the overload, overdose, fuck it  
It's over most fuck it, so go 'head with it  
People love the scene, it's all cream  
It's all flash, it all costs, it's all green  
It's all ching, it's the whole thing, the tv's  
Rims so mean, and so extreme  
Buy the bar out, and ride out with the best thing  
See me at the next thing, text ring  
It's head trauma, bad drama, they need body armor  
The streets is monster, the streets is Tonka  
Watch your truck, you might get stuck  
You might not wake up, wear the make-up  
You fake and shook, you won't get off the hook  
We takin dough right from off of your books  
Your whole label break up, you out of cake, wake up  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[unknown girl]  
(Rush) Okay, we got money, we got Manolos  
Bessa Mistra, Diors, bottles  
It's unstoppable, in V. I. P. Top shelf  
It's every day, it's not [?] baby  
You know how we do  
  
[Marc Live]  
Rush - blow up the street, blow off the mad heat  
Blow down the doors, it goes down mad raw  
It's too real, go get steel  
Stop all beef, snatch off the new piece  
Walk down the street, pass to my man Pete  
Go by Jacob and split all the cake up  
All in a day's work, go get paid work  
We made for it, break laws, rush for it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rush
