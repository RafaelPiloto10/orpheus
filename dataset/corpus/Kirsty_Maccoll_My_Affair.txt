When I was just a child  
My folks would drive me wild  
They'd spy upon my every move  
Until it drove me to despair  
They told me what to wear  
They told me not to cut my hair  
But that's all over now  
I had to tell them anyhow  
  
It's my affair  
Where I go and what I do  
It's my affair oh yeah  
It's my affair  
It's up to me and not to you  
It's my affair  
  
That's the way I want to keep it  
I kissed the boy in secret  
Thrilled me to the very core  
I couldn't stop I wanted more and  
I didn't hear the door and  
They caught me on the floor  
With my affair  
  
And when we first got wed  
We used to stay in bed  
All day and night all night and day  
We bedded half our lives away  
But that's all over now  
We move in higher circles  
Chomping through the upper crust  
I couldn't see you for the dust  
And then you met that girl  
Who left you with your money spent  
And now it's no concern of yours  
If I sleep with the President  
  
It's my affair  
And if I don't come home tonight  
It's my affair alright  
It's my affair  
Who I see is up to me  
It's my affair  
  
That's how I want to keep it  
I kiss the boys in secret  
Hiding in the parking lot  
Is just as far as I have got but  
If the phone should ring and  
There's no one there  
Then it's my affair  
  
Eso es asunto de ella  
Donde va why lo que hare  
  
Well it's all over now  
You've seen the last of me  
And I don't have to put up with you  
Giving me the third degree  
So you go on your way  
And don't come sneaking round the back door  
Trying to get yourself
