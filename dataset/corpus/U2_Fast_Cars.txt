My cell is ringing  
No ID  
I need to know who's calling  
  
My garden's overgrown  
I go out on my belly crawling  
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC  
I got the nightly news  
To get to know the enemy  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your face in a locket  
Picture in my pocket  
I take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
I'm going nowhere  
Where I am it is a lot of fun  
There in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb  
I watch you shadow box  
Check the stocks  
I'm in detox  
I want the lot of what you've got  
What you've got can make this stop  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your picture in a locket  
Your face in my pocket  
Take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
Child inside  
  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
  
You should worry 'bout the day  
That the pain it goes away  
You know I miss mine sometimes  
  
The size is much too big  
  
There is no fiction  
That will truly fit the situation  
I'm documenting every detail  
Every conversation  
Not used to talkin' to somebody in the body  
Somebody in a body,  
Somebody in a body
