There you go and baby here am I oh well you left me here so I could sit and
cry  
Oh will you apology what have you done to me but it really doesn't matter
anymore  
Do you remember baby last September when you held me tight each and every
night  
Oh well you was so dazy how you drove me crazy but it really doesn't matter
anymore  
There's no use in me of cryin' I've done everything and now I keep on tryin'  
I've thrown away my nights wasted all my days over you  
You'll go your way I'll go mine now and forever till the end of time  
I'll find somebody new and baby we'll say we're through  
Honey you won't matter anymore  
  
Do you remember baby last September...  
No sugar you won't matter anymore
