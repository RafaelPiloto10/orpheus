Wait!  
Before you walk out that door  
Hang your clothes in the closet  
You're forgetting one thing  
I'm the one who saved you  
From a long lonely life  
I'm the one who gave you  
You're first taste to paradise  
  
Look how you paying me back  
Look how you pack in your bag  
Please don't do me like this, honey  
All this good love you're going to miss  
  
Think about it, honey  
You really ought to think about it  
'Fore you leave me  
Dig this  
  
I'm the one who showed you  
How to live when you wanted to die  
I'm the one who taught you  
How to laugh when you wanted to cry  
  
But look what you're doing to me  
Look how you're hurting me  
Please don't do me like this  
All of this good loving your going to miss  
  
Think about it, baby, listen  
You really, really ought to think about it  
'Fore you leave  
You really ought to think about it  
Deep down think about it  
'Fore you leave me  
  
Do this for me honey  
Don't make me no lonely man  
Don't try to push me out of your plan  
Don't try to kick out love aside  
Just wait!  
Before you tell me goodbye  
  
Mmmm, yeah  
  
You really, really, really, really, really ought to think about it  
How I give it  
You really, really, really ought to think about it  
How I live it  
One million times  
I better stay up all night
