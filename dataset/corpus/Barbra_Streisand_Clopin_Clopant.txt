Goodbye, no use leading with our chins  
This is where our story ends  
Never lovers, ever friends  
  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day  
But before you walk away  
I sincerely want to say  
  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
And then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love!  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love!  
  
My breaking heart and i agree  
That you and i could never ever be  
So with my best, my very best, i set you free!  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
A cozy fire to keep you warm  
But most of all, but most of all  
  
When snowflakes fall, i wish you wealth  
I wish you health, i wish you love!
