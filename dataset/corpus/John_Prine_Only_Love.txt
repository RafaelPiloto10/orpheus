You may live alone and close your eyes  
Some folks do  
You may dream a dream that's twice your size  
All night through  
When the morning comes who's to tell your dreams to  
Only you  
  
[Chorus]  
Only love, love only, only love  
Will do  
Only love, love only, only love  
Comes true  
Nothing else, you see, there nothing else  
Only love, only love  
  
I have known a love within my heart  
One or two  
Where one love would end and one would start  
I never knew  
If love should come your way you'll learn to say  
I love you I love you  
  
[Chorus x 2]
