Something's wrong  
Cause my mind is fadin'  
And everywhere I look  
There's a dead end waiting,  
Temperature's dropping  
At the rottin' oasis  
Stealing kisses  
From the leperous faces  
  
Heads are hanging  
From the garbageman trees  
Mouthwash, jukebox, gasoline,  
Pistols are pointing  
At a poor man's pockets  
Smiling eyes  
Whippin' out of the sockets  
  
Got a devils haircut in my mind (X4)  
  
Love machines  
On the sympathy crutches  
Discount orgies  
On the dropout buses  
Hitchin' a ride  
With the bleedin' noses  
Comin' to town  
With the briefcase blues  
  
Got a devils haircut in my mind (X4)  
  
Somethin' wrong  
Cause my mind is fading  
Ghetto blastin' disintegrating  
Rock 'n' roll  
Know what I'm saying?  
Everywhere I look  
There's a devil in waiting.  
  
Got a devils haircut in my mind (X7)
