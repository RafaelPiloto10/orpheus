Cracklin' Rosie, get on board  
We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go  
Taking it slow  
Lord, don't you know  
Have made me a time with a poor man's lady  
  
Hitchin' on a twilight train  
Ain't nothing there that I care to take along  
Maybe a song  
To sing when I want  
Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune  
  
Oh, I love my Rosie child  
She got the way to make me happy  
You and me, we go in style  
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store bought woman  
You make me sing like a guitar hummin'  
So hang on to me, girl  
Our song keeps runnin' on  
  
Play it now  
Play it now, my baby  
  
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile  
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all right  
We got all night  
To set the world right  
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah  
  
Oh, I love my Rosie child  
You got the way to make me happy  
You and me, we go in style  
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store-baught woman  
You make me sing like a guitar hummin'  
So hang on to me, girl  
Our song keeps runnin' on  
  
Play it now  
Play it now  
Play it now, my baby  
  
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile  
God if it lasts for an hour, that's all right  
We got all night  
To set the world right  
Find us a dream that don't ask no question, yeah
