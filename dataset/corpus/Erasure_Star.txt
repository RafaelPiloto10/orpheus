Star  
We go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
You got to look real hard  
There's a fiery star  
Hidden out there somewhere  
Not the satellite of love  
But a laser  
Shooting out it's shiny tongue there  
  
God is love, God is war  
TV-preacher tell me more  
Load redeem me, am I pure?  
As pure as pure as heaven  
Sent you money sent you flowers  
Could worship you for hours  
In whose hands are we anyway?  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
You got to look real hard  
Is it in your heart?  
Yeah it's in there somewhere  
The power wrapped in your palm  
Show it to me  
Hit them with your wrath and thunder  
  
What's your pleasure?  
Tell it to me  
How did you know?  
Show your beauty  
In you somewhere, somewhere in me  
Pure as pure as heaven  
Sent you money sent you flowers  
Could worship you for hours  
In whose hands are we anyway?  
Yeeha  
  
Rolling along through a rose colored glow  
The city looks pretty in pink  
Armageddon is here!  
  
Did you ever have a lover  
Leave you for another  
To take your love and kisses for granted?  
Never to discover  
War is not the answer  
Leave you only disenchanted  
  
God is love, God is war  
TV-preacher tell me more  
Father help me am I pure?  
As pure as pure as heaven  
Sent you money sent you flowers  
Could worship you for hours  
In whose hands are we anyway?  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down  
  
Go waiting for the stars  
To come showering down  
From Moscow to Mars  
Universe falling down
