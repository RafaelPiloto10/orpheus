They say we are fools  
We say look at you  
Long ago  
We were just a few  
Still say we don't need you  
  
[Chorus]  
We don't wanna belong  
We said all along  
We just wanna be, left alone  
We don't wanna belong  
We said all along  
We just wanna be, left alone  
  
Think that we must have lost our way  
Running form the blaze  
You were wrong  
We chose our course  
Counted up the days  
Enduring in a rage  
We got strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You denied everything that's good  
Reacting as you would  
With your shame  
So we turned  
And left you all behind  
We don't need your kind  
You're to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In years to come  
You'll hear my name  
When darkness falls  
On Judgment Day  
  
They say we are fools  
We say look at you  
Long ago we were just a few  
Still say, we don't need you  
  
Think we have lost our way  
Running form the blaze  
You were wrong  
We chose our course  
Counted up the days  
Enduring in a rage  
We got strong  
  
[Chorus: x2]
