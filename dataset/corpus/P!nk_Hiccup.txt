1 Why every time I try to tell you how I feel  
It's like a hiccup-cup comes  
And it won't come come  
Soon as I think I'm bout to share my lovin'  
That's when the hiccups come in  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Like a cough on a rainy day  
You know the kind that gives you chest pains, yeah  
And just as things start to feel okay  
Then here you come to bring the rain  
Hold me hard then you squeeze me tight  
You let me go then you pick a fight  
You make me wanna scream, cry and shout out loud  
Boy you got me spinnin' round and round  
  
Repeat 1  
  
My thoughts they kind of shaky (kind of shaky)  
Every time I get around you sweet baby  
Sometimes I don't know what I'm trying to say  
Just tell me baby  
Tell me things are gonna be okay  
  
Repeat 1 (2x)  
  
Ohhh I, I get all choked up inside (inside)  
And I don't know what to say  
(Don't know what to say)  
Sometimes I wanna just run and hide  
But you just stand in my way  
  
Repeat 1 (2x)  
  
Why every time I tell you how I feel  
It's like a hiccup-cup comes  
And you know the deal  
Pink don't think before she speak  
But you got me feeling, feeling, feeling kind of weak  
Why every time I tell you how I feel  
It's like a hiccup-cup comes  
And you know the deal  
Pink don't think before she speak  
But you got me feeling, feeling, feeling kind of weak  
  
Repeat 1 till end
