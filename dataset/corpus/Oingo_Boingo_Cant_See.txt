We were both cast forth from the same pale hand  
And we both moved freely in the shadowlands  
And we both were sculpted by the same cold wind  
And we both had armor that was made of tin  
And i tried to find you, but it's useless  
And i tried to speak, but it was useless  
And i felt so bad and i didn't know why  
And it didn't get better as time went by  
I was there for you, but you turned away  
And i tried to find you, but you turned away  
And i tried to find you, but it's useless  
And i tried to speak, but was useless  
And i tried to find you, but it's useless  
And you're so close, but i can't see you  
And you're right there, but i can't see you  
And i feel so dumb and i didn't know what to do  
You were right there but i can't see you  
And i realize that it's useless  
And i want to fight, but it's useless  
And i know you're there, but it's useless  
And you're everywhere, but it's useless  
And i tried to say it, but my tongue got tied  
And i tried to say it, but i was numb inside  
And i can't see you anymore  
And my peace of mind has gone through the door  
And i realize that it's useless  
And i thought i was right, but it was useless  
And i know you're there, but it's useless  
And you're everywhere, but it's useless  
And i can't see now in front of my nose  
And i know you're there, and i know you're close  
And you're fading away - now you disappear  
And i try to focus, but i can't see clear  
And i don't know why i feel this way  
And i can't control myself anyway  
And i don't know why i feel this way  
And i can't control myself anyway  
And i feel so bad, but it's useless  
And i feel so bad, but it's useless  
And i feel so bad, but it's useless  
And i can't see... now in front of my face.
