I know better than anybody how it feels to want somebody so bad after you
break up  
  
Still  
(Looking for that phone call)  
  
Still  
(Even when they don't)  
  
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it all over  
Act like you wasn't listening when they told ya  
They don't want to be with you anymore  
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore  
  
'Cause in your mind, you're still together  
Thought it would last but there's no forever  
Walked out on you with no call, no letter  
When he realize it don't get no better  
  
He'll be back  
To make up for the lonely days  
He'll be back  
When things ain't working out his way  
He'll be back  
When he sees that it's not the same  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
He'll be back  
  
He knows he's gonna need his lady  
He'll be back  
When his boys say he must be crazy  
He'll be back  
He'll know he made a big mistake  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
He'll be back  
  
You don't want to believe it but you see it happening  
Wakes you up out of your sleep, out of the dreams you're having  
  
Still  
(Looking for his return)  
  
Still  
(Hoping that he's gonna learn)  
  
Wake up and realize the truth, make some time for you  
What's he trying to do to you  
Miss him more as days go by  
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive  
  
'Cause in your mind, you're still together  
Thought it would last but there's no forever  
Walked out on you with no call, no letter  
When he realize it don't get no better  
  
He'll be back  
To make up for the lonely days  
He'll be back  
When things ain't working out his way  
He'll be back  
When he sees that it's not the same  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
(He'll be back)  
  
He knows he's gonna need his lady  
He'll be back  
When his boys say he must be crazy  
He'll be back  
He'll know he made a big mistake  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
He'll be back (he'll be back)  
(He'll be back)
