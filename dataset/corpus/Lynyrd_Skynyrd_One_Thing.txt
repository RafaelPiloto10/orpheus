I met the man, when I was fifteen  
Seen him in all the papers, on TV. and magazines  
So I had to ask him, what's the difference between  
Those who make a wish, those who spin wheels  
And those who ride in white limousines like you, mister  
Won't you tell me one thing  
  
Some have the passion and they control the ride  
Some settle for whatever happens  
As years pass they see their lives just slip on by  
The world keeps a' turnin'  
It'll leave you behind  
Nothin' else matters, nothin's worth learnin'  
Until the dream you have inside  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the one thing, the one thing there's no denyin'  
So find yourself a dream and some piece of mind  
'cause money and power won't buy it  
It's the one thing, nothin' else matters  
  
And somewhere you might have heard the good times are through  
And good luck is somethin' you're born with  
I know it just ain't true  
The world keeps a' turnin'  
I wouldn't tell you no lie  
Nothin' else matters, nothin's worth learnin'  
Until the dream that you have inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothin' else matters
