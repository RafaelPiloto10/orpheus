Struck by the moon  
Risin' too soon  
I feel a pain deep inside me  
Cold northern winds  
Fist in my chin  
Makin' me wild for you baby  
  
What can I do  
To get back to you  
I'm feeling desperate and lonely  
The city's a river  
Of cold misery  
Makin' me wild for you baby  
  
I'm down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry  
  
Nites I can't sleep  
My tears are cheap  
I'm losin' hold of my senses  
I can't contain  
All of this pain  
And it's makin' me wild for you baby  
  
I'm down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry
