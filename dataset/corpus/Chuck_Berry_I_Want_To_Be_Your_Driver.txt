I want to be your driver, I want to be your driver  
I would love to ride you, I would love to ride you around  
We'll be ready when you want me to drive you on downtown  
  
Yeah I want to drive your, your long and beautiful  
Your rounded-body, wheel-to-roll limousine  
I've never had the thrill of riding such a wonderful machine  
  
We'll roll 'round the mountain, drive down in the valley  
I would drive it all over, I would ride you home with ease  
You will enjoy every journey, it will be my aim to please  
  
So let me be your driver, let me be your driver  
I would love to ride you, I would love to ride you downtown  
Drive you so slow and easy you won't want to put me down
