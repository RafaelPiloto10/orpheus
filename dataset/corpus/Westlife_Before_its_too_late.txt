All things come to those who wait  
Sometimes they just come too late  
And if we never speak again  
I don't wanna make that mistake  
We never seem to find  
The place or time  
To say what's on our minds so  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me everything now  
Don't leave anything out  
I'll tell you all my fears  
My mistakes  
Before it's too late  
  
I don't wanna wake up one day  
Wondering if I shied away  
From something that once seemed so hard  
One thing that's so simple to say  
Why do you always hide  
Your tears when you cry?  
Isn't it time you try to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before it's too late  
Before it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before it's too late  
Before it's too late
