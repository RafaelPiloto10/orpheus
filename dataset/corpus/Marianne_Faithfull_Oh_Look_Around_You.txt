"oh, look around you,  
Tell me what do you see ?  
Do you see the yellow morning  
And the green land so free ? "  
"oh no, I see no morning  
But lands of dark and grey  
And they tell me the green land  
Has long gone away,  
Has long gone away."  
"once more look around you,  
Tell me what do you see ?  
Do you see the clear wave laughter  
And the deep blue sea ? "  
"oh no, there is no sorrow  
Where the laughing tree stood  
And they tell me the blue sea  
Has long turned to blood,  
Has long turned to blood."  
"no more look around you,  
Say no more what you see.  
But give me your cold hand  
And lay beside me.  
And there, oh my darling,  
You will never worry  
And we, like the others,  
Will forget in our sleep,  
Will forget in our sleep."
