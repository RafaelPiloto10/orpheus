There's no need for you to tell me  
I can see the way you feel  
I just know without you saying  
What is a lie and what's real  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
Something's going on, and I know it  
You can't keep it from me  
Your smile cannot hide what you feel inside  
And I don't like what I see  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories  
If you want to leave me, leave me  
No good living a lie  
You can pretend that we're not gonna end  
But your eyes are saying goodbye  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories  
Tell me, I got a right to know  
Pour your little heart out to me, baby  
You know, you know I don't want to let go  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye
