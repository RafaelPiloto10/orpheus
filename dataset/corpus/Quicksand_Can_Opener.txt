A trap to fall,  
Fall into easy,  
Believe in what you look like, outside.  
A stain you can't remove.  
A stain that keeps you from that place,  
Where you're probably have much left to prove.  
Come down, don't fall, over your ego.  
Don't mind your friends,  
They just want to go where the fun goes down.  
Yeah, you want to go up, up-up, up,  
Hip, hip, hooray, for you.  
Now your the one that everyone talks about.  
The attention your not getting it makes you so upset.  
So take, me down,  
To the place where you can look your best,  
Better than anyone else around.  
A stain you can't remove.  
A stain that keeps you from that place,  
Where you've probably have much less to prove.  
Once you tried.  
Once you tried,  
Tried to get it right,  
But you couldn't figure out what it takes,  
To be liked,  
You're grown up.  
And now you've gone back,  
To find, a way, to get, along, it's just, an act.  
You can wipe that smile.  
Now you're the one that everyone talks about.  
Take time, take it easy.  
I know you work so hard,  
But your advantage is your beauty,  
And that's beautiful.  
Take time, take it easy.  
I know you work so hard,  
But you know what your advantage is,  
And that's beautiful,  
And that's beautiful,  
And that's beauty.
