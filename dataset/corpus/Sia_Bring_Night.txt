Bring night, bring the night on  
Bring a little bit of dance, bring a little bit of song, yeah  
Bring night, bring the night on  
I'm not sure I can wait and this day has felt so long, yeah  
  
Bring night, bring the night on  
The music cuts into me and I know it can't be wrong, yeah  
Bring night, bring the night on  
'Cuz all that we are after is a little bit of fun, yeah  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh, ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh  
  
Bring night, bring the night on  
Bring me the moon and stars and send away the sun, yeah  
Bring night, bring the night on  
Or maybe if I'm lucky I'll end up in your arms  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh, ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh, ooh, ooh, whoa, ohh  
  
Bring night, bring the night on
