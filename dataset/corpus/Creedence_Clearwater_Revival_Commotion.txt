Traffic in the city turns my head around.  
No, no, no, no, no.  
Backed up on the freeway, backed up in the church,  
Everywhere you look there's a frown, frown.  
  
[Chorus]  
Com, commotion,  
Git, git, git, gone.  
Com, commotion,  
Git, git, git, gone.  
  
People keep atalkin', they don't say a word.  
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw.  
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door,  
So much goin' on I just can't hear.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurryin' to get there so you save some time.  
Run, run, run, run, run.  
Rushin' to the treadmill, rushin' to get home,  
Worry 'bout the time you save, save.  
  
[Chorus]
