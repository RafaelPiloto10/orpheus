On darkened streets tonight  
I see a simple time  
I see the warning light  
And the summer comes undone  
No sorry closing eyes  
No cutting down to size  
No other thoughts arise  
And the summer come undone  
  
On darkened streets tonight  
I make a wrong turn right  
Take in the lonely sight  
And the summer comes undone  
  
And I won't wait  
And I won't have to  
I just waste me time alone  
'til the summer comes undone  
'til the summer comes undone  
'til the summer comes undone
