Wheels are turning  
I remember when you were mine  
Now just to reach you  
Baby, I'd stand in line  
  
But there's another world  
We're living in  
Tonight  
  
And there's another heart  
That's fading in  
The light  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Don't want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Spent the summer, just laying out in the sun  
Time seems to move so slow  
When you're taking it as it comes  
Maybe we were just too young  
  
Your body was tanned and your hair was long  
You showed me your smile and my cares were gone  
Falling in love filled my soul with fright  
You said "Come on babe, it'll be alright"  
I must have been a fool to the bitter end  
Now I hold on to hope to have you back again  
I'd bargain and I'd fight  
  
But there's another world  
We're living in  
Tonight  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
I don't want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Well I saw you in a restaurant  
The other day  
And instead of walking towards you  
I ran away  
And I'll keep on waiting for you  
Till you'll come around  
Come around and say  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Don't need those memories  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Ooh!  
Ooh!  
Here with me  
Ooh!  
Ooh!  
Ooh!  
Here with me
