Oh Oh some deep shit  
Uh uh  
  
[Verse 1]  
Mama please stop cryin',  
I can't stand the sound.  
Your pain is painful and it's tearing me down.  
I hear glasses breakin',  
As I sit up in my bed,  
I told God you didn't mean those nasty things you said.  
You fight about money,  
'Bout me and my brother,  
And this I come home to,  
This is my shelter.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It ain't easy, growin' up in world war III,  
Never knowin' what love could be.  
You'll see, I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family  
  
[Chorus]  
Can we work it out?  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better,  
Mommy I'll do anything.  
Can we work it out?  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better,  
Daddy please don't leave.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Daddy please stop yelling (stop),  
I can't stand the sound (can't stand the sound).  
Make mama stop cryin',  
'Cause I need you around (yeah, yeah, yeah).  
My mama she loves you (I know it),  
No matter what she says is true.  
I know that she hurts you,  
But remember I love you too!  
I ran away today, ran from the noise,  
Ran away (ran away),  
Don't wanna go back to that place,  
But don't have no choice, no way.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It ain't easy, growin' up in world war III,  
Never knowin' what love could be.  
You'll see, I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family  
  
[Chorus]  
Can we work it out? (Can we work it)  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better (I promise),  
Mommy I'll do anything (anything to keep you back).  
Can we work it out?  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better (I promise, I promise),  
Daddy please don't leave.  
  
[Bridge]  
In our family portrait (in our family portrait),  
We look pretty happy (we look pretty happy).  
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally.  
I don't wanna have to split the holidays (no, no),  
I don't want two addresses (no, no),  
I don't want a stepbrother anyway,  
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name!  
  
In our family portrait,  
We look pretty happy,  
We look pretty normal,  
Let's go back to that.  
In our family portrait,  
We look pretty happy,  
Lets play pretend, act like it goes naturally.  
  
In our family portrait (Can we work it out)  
We look pretty happy (Can we be a family)  
We look pretty normal (I promise I'll be better)  
Lets go back to that (Mommy I'll do anything)  
In our family portrait (Can we work it out)  
We look pretty happy (Can we be a family)  
Lets play pretend (I promise I'll be better)  
Act like it goes naturally, (Daddy please don't leave)  
Oh lets go back Oh lets go back  
  
In our family portrait (Can we work it out)  
We look pretty happy (Can we be a family)  
We look pretty normal (I promise I'll be better)  
Lets go back to that (Mommy I'll do anything)  
In our family portrait (Can we work it out)  
We look pretty happy (Can we be a family)  
We look pretty normal (I promise I'll be better)  
Lets go back to that (Daddy please don't leave)  
  
Don't leave... Don't leave... Daddy don't leave...  
Don't leave... Daddy don't leave...  
Daddy don't leave... Daddy don't leave... Daddy don't leave...  
Don't leave... Don't leave...  
Turn around please  
  
Remember that the night you left  
You took my shining star  
Daddy don't leave...  
Daddy don't leave...  
Daddy don't leave...  
  
Mama'll be nicer  
I'll be so much better  
I'll tell my brother  
I won't spill the milk at dinner  
I'll be so much better  
I'll do everything right  
I'll be your little girl forever  
I'll go to sleep at night  
  
Ooh no Ooh no  
Ooh no Ooh
