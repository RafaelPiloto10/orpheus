One life I'm gonna live it up  
I'm takin' I said I'll never get enough  
Stand tall I'm uh, young and kind of proud  
I'm on the top, but as long as the music's loud  
  
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by  
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think I'll let you go you're mad  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
  
That's right here's where the talking ends  
Well, listen, this night there'll be some action spent  
Drive hard callin' all the shots  
I got an ace card comin' down rocks  
  
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain  
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think I'll let it go you're mad  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
  
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow  
Answer now and don't give in aim for a new tomorrow  
  
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah  
Act tough ain't room for second best  
Real strong got me some security  
Hey, I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah!  
  
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by  
You're thinkin' like a fool cause it's a case of do or die  
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had  
If you think I'll let you go you're mad  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing comin'  
You've got another thing ahh  
Comin' down!
