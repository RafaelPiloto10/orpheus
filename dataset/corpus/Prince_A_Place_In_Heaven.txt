She wants a place in heaven  
But she cannot face the truth  
She lives on a rope of self-pity  
It only requires a noose  
  
Why are the ones so afraid 2 live  
Much more afraid 2 die?  
It's as easy 2 imagine laughing  
  
When U really hear a cry  
And they sound the same  
In hell, they sound the same  
U want a place in heaven  
  
Maybe U're already there  
Life's what U make it, stop whining baby  
  
Love comes 2 those who care  
There must be children in heaven  
Ones who know nothing from hate  
  
3-year-old leaders of all colors  
I'd feel safer with them in control, control, control, control  
3-year-olds in control  
  
We all want a place in heaven  
Suites of that level are few  
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service  
  
It's all up 2 me and U  
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service  
It's all up 2 me and U
