Don't you know  
They're talkin' bout a revolution  
It sounds like a whisper  
Don't you know  
They're talkin' about a revolution  
It sounds like a whisper  
While they're standing in the welfare lines  
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation  
Wasting time in the unemployment lines  
Sitting around waiting for a promotion  
  
Poor people gonna rise up  
And get their share  
Poor people gonna rise up  
And take what's theirs  
  
Don't you know  
You better run, run, run  
Oh I said you better  
Run, run, run  
  
Finally the tables are starting to turn  
Talkin' bout a revolution
