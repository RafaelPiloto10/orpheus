Come and whisper to me of a time  
When you felt like this  
With a unimaginable kiss that's made especially for me  
You can't avoid it  
I'm telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You would melt away in my hands  
  
Chours:  
Dream with me  
Come and let me feel it  
The pasion that was born in me  
With the fire of your love  
Just one more night  
I wantto be next to you and fly  
Be your vice and a little more  
The wish for your love  
I want to provoke you slowly now that I have you here  
What noboy else is suppose to give  
That's what I'm giving you  
You can't avoid it  
I'm telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You'd melt away in my hands  
  
(Chours)  
Here you have me, I'm all yours  
What you've been looking for in me, I'm giving to you
