I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)  
  
I don't mind  
If it's the cold and sadistic you like  
But now I'm thinking  
Who's wearing your trousers now  
She's no good  
Oh stop pretending she's misunderstood  
I heard her saying it's either me or her  
Smell the coffee, boy, and open your eyes  
Life's too long for you to get it wrong  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)  
  
Oh, poor you  
With all your lockets that have broken in two  
Does she get a little excited, don't hide it  
I heard her screaming in the dead of the night  
Life's too long for you to get it wrong  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)  
  
Ringy dingy ding ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding-a ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Girlfriend wants to see who's calling  
Freaking out, your phone keeps going  
Ringy dingy ding ding ding ding  
Ringy dingy ding ding  
Life's too long  
  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
I see it in her eyes  
The way she looks right on me  
It opens up in time  
I know your girlfriend hates me  
See you know it's true  
The way she hangs upon you  
And watches every move, come on  
Girl you think you're something  
But have I got news for you (who)
