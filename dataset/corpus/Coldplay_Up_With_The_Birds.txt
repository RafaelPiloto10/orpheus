The birds they sang, at break of day  
Start again I hear them say  
It's so hard to just walk away  
  
The birds they sang, all a choir  
Start again a little higher  
It's a spark in a sea of gray  
  
The sky is blue dream that lie 'till it's true  
Then taken back the punch I threw  
My arms turn in oh, those clumsy things  
Send me up to that wonderful world  
And then I'm up with the birds  
  
Might have to go  
Where they don't know my name  
Float all over the world  
Just to see her again  
And I won't show or feel any pain  
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain  
  
A simple plot  
But I know one day  
Good things are coming our way  
  
A simple plot  
But I know one day  
Good things are coming our way  
  
Oh, yeah
