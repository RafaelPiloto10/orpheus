[Intro]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa Tell Me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Verse 1]  
Feeling Christmas all around  
And I'm trying to play it cool  
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room  
Let It Snow is blasting now  
But I won't get it in the mood  
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been down this road before  
Fell in love on Christmas night  
But I knew you say I woke up and you wasn't by my side  
Now I need someone to hold  
Be my fire in the cold  
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh I wanna have him beside me like ooh  
On the 25th by the fireplace ooh  
But I don't want no broken heart  
This year I've got to be smart  
  
Oh baby  
Santa tell me  
Santa tell me  
Santa tell me  
If he will be here  
  
[Chorus]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Outro]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year
