When you tried to kiss me  
I only bit your tongue.  
When you tried to get me together  
I only came undone.  
When you tried to tell me  
The one for me was you,  
I was in your mattress back in 1982.  
  
Daria, I won't be soothed.  
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,  
Smoothed over like milk,  
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,  
Icing on a cake,  
Or a serene translucent lake.  
Daria, Daria, Daria,  
I won't be soothed.  
I won't be soothed.  
  
When you tried to tell me  
Of all the love you had,  
I was cleaning oil from beaches  
Seeing only what was bad.  
When you tried to feed me  
I only shut my mouth.  
Food got on your apron  
And you told me to get out.  
  
Daria, I won't be soothed.  
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,  
Smoothed over like milk,  
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,  
Icing on a cake,  
Or a serene translucent lake.  
Daria, Daria, Daria,  
Daria, Daria, Daria,  
Daria, I won't be soothed.  
I won't be soothed.
