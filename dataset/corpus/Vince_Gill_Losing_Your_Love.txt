Stars are falling from your eyes  
You don't feel what I feel inside  
Your hand is warm but your heart is cold  
If you're hurtin' you don't let it show  
  
How much longer can we go on  
Actin' like there's nothin' wrong  
How much farther can we drift apart  
Before all the feeling is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm losing your love  
It's slippin' away  
Minute by minute  
Day by day  
Losing your love  
Don't you think I know  
It's a matter of time  
'Til you let go  
  
I see the moon shinin' up above  
Reminded me how good it was  
There's a chill comin' over me  
Why can't it be like it used to be  
  
I feel so helpless, I can't make you stay  
No matter how hard I try  
I can't deny that look in your eyes  
Tryin' to tell me goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
Don't let go
