You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart  
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by  
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and  
I don't care honey if you love me or not  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be a-standing at your door  
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and  
I don't want you around me anymore  
  
Because you can't have your way you tell me every day  
I should grow up stop acting like a child  
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do  
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while  
  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be a-standing at your door  
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and  
I don't want you around me anymore
