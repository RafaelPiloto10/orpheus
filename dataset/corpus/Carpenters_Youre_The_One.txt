Ev'ry night, ev'ry day  
You're the one I always dream of  
Ev'ry line of your face  
Is sketched so plain inside my heart  
You've grown so deep inside of me  
You're everything I feel and see  
And you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
All my life, all my love  
I can feel when you're beside me  
All that's right, all that's wrong  
Suddenly becomes so clear  
My heart has overtaken me  
With feelings you awake in me  
And you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
Only you could move me enough to believe in love one more time  
All I need to know for tomorrow is that you're mine  
Mine for a lifetime  
  
If our friends all around  
Find it hard to understand us  
You and I understand the other one so very well  
And that's what I've been looking for  
So I keep coming back for more  
'Cause you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
You're the one, you're the one I love
