Don't know what you've got  
Not till you lose it  
You had my love but you only abused it  
I've had enough of all your excuses and lies  
  
You can look but don't you touch  
You played around girl, much too much  
You had it all but you gave it up  
It's too late  
  
What you see is what you don't get  
You had your chance and then you blew it  
I was the one you never knew it  
Now it's time to forget  
What you see is what you can't have  
You're missing out and that is too bad  
I was the one who had the last laugh  
And all you've got is regret  
  
I made up my mind, showed your true colors  
One of a kind? No you're just like the others  
I'm saying goodbye to all your excuses and lies  
And now there's nothing left to say  
So why are you standing in my way?  
And don't go begging me to stay, it's too late  
  
What you see is what you don't get  
You had your chance and then you blew it  
I was the one you never knew it  
Now it's time to forget  
What you see is what you can't have  
You're missing out and that is too bad  
  
I was the one who had the last laugh  
And all you've got is regret  
What you see is what you don't get  
Are you a fool or have you got it yet?  
You had it all and then you threw it all away
