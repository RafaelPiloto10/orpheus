What if I'm right and you are wrong?  
What if you knew it all along?  
What if I figured out that I did not belong?  
  
What if it always bothered me?  
What if I never did believe?  
Would it be wrong if I decided I should leave?  
  
If I pretended I was blind  
And struck it from my mind  
Would it still be there?  
What if I'd do anything to make it seem all right  
It's all right  
  
What if it's all inside my head?  
What if those words were never said?  
Would it be easier if I could just forget?  
  
What if I didn't run away?  
Could it be any other way?  
Would it be wrong if I decided I should stay?
