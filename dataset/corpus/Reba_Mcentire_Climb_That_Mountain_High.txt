Red sun a-rising, over the hill  
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until  
I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth  
This could be the day I finally find my way out  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna climb that mountain high  
I'm gonna see what's on the other side  
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye  
I'm gonna climb that mountain  
  
How I arrived here, heaven only knows  
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose  
To spend my life here, is more than I can do  
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I stay here forever  
What will I have to show  
But if I make it over  
Then everyone will know  
I'm gonna climb that mountain high  
  
[Chorus]
