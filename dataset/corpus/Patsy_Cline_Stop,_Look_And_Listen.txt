Well, I know a cool cat from way downtown  
He's been boppin' all around  
In this ole world he's livin' fast  
Someday I'm afraid he's gonna run outta gas  
So if you're travelin' that way, too  
I tell you, friend, what you better do  
  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Hey, ya don't know what you're missin'  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
'Cause ya might be missin' kissin'  
If you're trav'lin' slow, you'll go a long, long way  
  
Now, Farmer Jones, he came to town  
And saw that boppin' all around  
He learned to do it, there's no doubt  
I'm afraid someday he'll burn his motor out  
So if you're travelin' that way, too  
I tell you, friend, what you better do  
  
First came the boogie, then the bunny hop  
Now the rhumba, samba, then the bop  
Well, I don't know what's a-comin' next  
But this ole world's in a terrible fix  
So if you're travelin' that way, too  
I tell you, friend, what you better do  
  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Ya gotta stop, look and listen  
Ya gotta stop
