For sale one ring that's on your finger (it's such a pretty thing)  
For sale my memories that linger (I remember everything)  
For sale our home that stood on lover's lane  
The roses in the backyard will never seem the same  
For sale one pillow stained from crying  
For sale one soul that's tired from trying  
You said to me it was never meant to be  
So goodbye good luck for sale
