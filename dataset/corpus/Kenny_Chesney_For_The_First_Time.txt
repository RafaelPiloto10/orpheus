There's somethin' sacred when your seventeen  
'Bout a football jacket and a high school ring  
And it sure looked nice  
When you wore mine  
That late October at a homecoming dance  
We slipped outside and we took a chance  
In the middle of the night  
Man it sure felt right  
We let go right then and there  
We were loved and we were scared  
  
[Chorus]  
For the first time  
Lovin' blind we dove right in  
For the first time  
We gave everything and then  
Graduation came  
And our dreams called our names  
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives  
For the first time  
  
Well I heard the other day  
Your a Sunday school teacher got the pta  
Got a real good life  
Your a real good wife  
I'm livin' in this circus world  
No I ain't married but I got a girl  
And I'm her man  
We're makin' plans  
But I still smile when I think of us  
Together we learned how to love  
  
[Chorus]
