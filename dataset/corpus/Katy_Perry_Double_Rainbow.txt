You're a one of a one  
A one of a kind  
That you only find once in a lifetime  
Made to fit like a fingerprint  
A code that clicks open a gold mine  
  
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure  
When I found you, it was all pretty better  
  
Secretly, I hit the lottery 'cause you're  
Brighter than all of the Northern the Lights  
You speak to me, even in my dreams, wouldn't  
Let you go for even the highest price  
  
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure  
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever  
  
'Cause I understand you,  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go  
So will I  
'Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
Was a phenomenon when you came along, yeah  
Chemistry was more than science  
It was deafening, loud like  
lightning, it was striking, you couldn't deny it  
  
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure  
The two of us together, make everything glitter  
  
'Cause I understand you,  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go  
So will I  
'Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you  
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you  
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind  
  
(Ooh ooh ooh)  
  
'Cause I understand you,  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go (I go up for you)  
So will I  
'Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
It's hard to find  
Oh it's hard to find  
Once in a lifetime ah  
  
Once in a lifetime  
Once in a lifetime
