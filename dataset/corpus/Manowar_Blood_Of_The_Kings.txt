Brothers the battle is raging choose your side  
Sing with us the battle hymns into glory ride  
Hail to England the sign of the hammer's our guide  
Forever we're fighting the world side by side  
On a crusade the world we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Death to the false ones, dance on a string  
'Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a king  
'Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a king  
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales  
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France will not fail  
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy  
Switzerland, Austria back to the glory of Germany  
On a crusade the world we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Death to the false ones, dance on a string  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a king  
Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a king  
Sound the death tone on our march for revenge  
Spill the blood of my enemies the oath of a friend  
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring  
Six magic circles were made by the blood of the kings  
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Songs of true metal we will sing  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a king  
Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a king  
Sound the death tone on our march for revenge  
Spill the blood of my enemies the oath a friend  
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring  
Six magic circles were made by the blood of the kings  
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Death to the false ones, dance on a string  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a King  
Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a King  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a King  
Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a King  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a King  
Blood of a King, blood of a King
