Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation  
It's Parker's band with a smooth style of syncopation  
Kansas City born and growing  
You won't believe what the boys are blowing  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band  
  
You'll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo  
You'll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo  
Suddenly the music hits you  
It's a bird in flight that just can't quit you  
  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band  
  
We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance  
Me and you will listen to  
A little bit of what made the preacher dance  
  
Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection  
And if you can't fly you'll have to move in with the rhythm section  
Either way you're bound to function  
Fifty-Second Street's the junction  
  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parker's  
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parker's  
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band
