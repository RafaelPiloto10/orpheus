I can't win, I can't reign  
I will never win this game without you, without you  
I am lost, I am vain,  
I will never be the same without you, without you  
  
I won't run, I won't fly  
I will never make it by without you, without you  
I can't rest, I can't fight  
All I need is you and I, without you, without you  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh  
You! You! You!  
Without  
You! You! You!  
Without you  
  
Can't erase, so I'll take blame  
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you, without you  
I can't quit now, this can't be right  
I can't take one more sleepless night without you, without you  
I won't soar, I won't climb  
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you, without you  
I can't look, I'm so blind  
I lost my heart, I lost my mind without you, without you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am lost, I am vain,  
I will never be the same without you, without you  
Without you
