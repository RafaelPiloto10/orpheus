I'm your crucifix, your burning light.  
I'm the perfect mix, of wrong and right.  
I'm your full blown blue eyed devil,  
It's my nature to deceive.  
You're the classic lost example,  
With a need to believe, need to believe.  
You want to  
  
Walk in God-like.  
Immune to dyin',  
What was I thinkin' as I bent my knee and hailed!?  
Walk in God-like.  
Immortal cryin',  
What were you thinking as you took the hammer  
in your hand and nailed?  
  
I'm your black book, thatcha live by.  
I'm the fisherman's hook, that ya kill by.  
I provide your inner peace,  
Faith in complication.  
I provide the means the tools,  
For blessed devastation.  
Now you're closer to  
  
I'm your crucifix, I'm your black book.  
I'm your crucifix, Your holy black book.  
I'm your crucifix, I'm your black book.  
I'm your crucifix, Read your black book!  
  
Like lambs to the slaughter, they come!  
Like men in need of water, they come!  
  
I'm your full blown blue eyed devil!  
It's my nature to deceive!  
You're the classic lost example with a need to believe!  
Need to believe!  
  
Walk in Godlike!
