Maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should  
Maybe I didn't love you  
Quite as often as I could  
Little things I should have said and done  
I never took the time  
  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely, lonely times  
And I guess I never told you  
I am so happy that you're mine  
If I made you feel second best  
I'm so sorry I was blind  
  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me,  
One more chance to keep you satisfied  
Satisfied  
  
Little things that I should have said and done  
I never took the time  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me,  
One more chance to keep you satisfied  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should  
Maybe I didn't love you  
Quite as often as I could  
Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely lonely times  
I guess I never told you  
I am so happy that you're mine
