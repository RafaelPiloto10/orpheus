Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat talking on the wild side  
He knows he looks the way he should  
He's got something making him feel good  
He's got the style, he's got the sway  
He's a million miles away  
  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
She don't smile, she don't look  
She don't do laundry and she don't cook  
She's not listening to what he says  
She's not making any promises  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone  
  
Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat stalking on the wild side  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
He's thinking how she's not so tough  
Could be a diamond sitting in the rough  
She's staring out to empty space  
She's wondering how long he will take  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone
