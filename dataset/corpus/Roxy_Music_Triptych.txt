Here the soil is barren  
Here, nothing grows  
But crosses  
They, know not what they do  
You, your forgiveness  
Falls as dew  
Nailed upon a wooden frame  
Twisted yet unbroken  
Open mounted a silent choir  
Understood, unspoken  
Never was there heard a sound  
Until the heavens opened  
Now the tide is turning  
To other-wordly yearning  
Through the sun's eclipse seems final  
Surely he will rise again
