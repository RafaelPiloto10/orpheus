Gather 'round!  
Punch and Judy,  
Did it truly,  
And were married in a haste,  
In love, maybe,  
Using the baby,  
As a kind of romance paste,  
She's grown fatter,  
Her hair cut shorter,  
Looks much older than nineteen,  
He's a drinker,  
Not a thinker,  
Baby spoiled his could-have-been.  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
'Cause who do we know, dear, who acts like that?  
Punch and Judy.  
Punch and Judy,  
In a semi,  
On a brand new council plot,  
Sunday lunchtime,  
Beer-for-Punch time,  
While his dinner's far from hot,  
She grows tired,  
Cab is hired,  
She goes round to see her friend,  
He comes back late,  
Fool is irate,  
We will see his temper bend.  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
Cause who do we know, dear, who acts like that?  
Punch and Judy,  
In a quandary,  
She's walked out, and he is mad.  
Now he's grown up,  
Can't smash home up,  
Retribution must be had.  
Punch and Judy,  
Had a baby,  
Who brought them to married bliss.  
Mr Punch,,  
Has drunken hunch,  
That he must punish kid for this  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
'Cause who do we know, dear, who acts like that?  
Punch and Judy
