Remember when we walked on hills of heather  
Singing weaving mystical rings  
Now in a while my precious child  
You wil unfurl your wings  
And I'll have lost what I believed  
Had promised everything  
But before you go my friend, my kind companion  
Listen to this song I sing  
  
Then go in peace and grow in grace and goodness  
Know that you have nothing to fear  
And dry your eyes my little one  
And let there be no tears  
Send me a dream from away beyond  
I promise I shall hear  
Oh beautifull beloved soul companion  
Thank you for those beautifull years  
  
And heaven hold and watch your way forever  
May your every dream com true  
Forgive all wrong, always be strong  
And do what you must do  
You stand before this open door  
And you must now go through  
My precious friend, my own my sweet companion  
Bless the road that carries you  
My precious friend, myu own my sweet companion  
Bless the road that carries you
