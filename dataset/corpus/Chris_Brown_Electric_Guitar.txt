He plays  
The sweetest melody  
When I hear it  
Takes over me  
And I feel  
Every strum  
Of the strings  
It reminds me  
Of all the things  
We used to be  
Can't breathe at all  
Cause you're coming  
  
Coming through  
My speaker  
Speaker  
Got me trying  
To reach ya  
Reach ya  
But I got  
To feature, feature  
My electric guitar  
Everytime  
I'm by you, by you?  
Everytime  
I'm by him, by him  
You're ripping up  
On the chords  
Playing my heart  
Electric guitar (6x)  
  
It kills me  
That I can't be  
With you  
Thought I was the key  
You're playing  
Don't know  
I just gotta be the one  
You let bleed out  
Wish I didn't know you  
Got me feeling stuck  
I can't let you go  
Just my luck  
Falling down  
Without you  
Can you pick me up  
And I can get you  
Off my head  
  
Coming through  
My speaker  
Speaker  
Got me trying  
To reach ya  
Reach ya  
But I got to feature  
Feature  
My electric guitar  
Everytime  
I'm by you  
By you?  
Everytime  
I'm by him  
By him  
You're ripping up  
On the chords  
Playing my heart  
Electric guitar (6x)  
  
I got to need you  
Cause I love you  
And I want you  
But I got to let go  
Cause I need to fart  
Really really bad  
And if it smells  
I might die  
And my face will be bad  
Hehe  
  
I'm losing  
My composure  
Oh  
I can't gain you over  
You must think  
That I'm crazy, girl  
Please control me  
With your melody  
I'll play it  
For the world  
Cause I'm your girl  
And I just wanna hear  
(So)  
  
Coming through  
My speakers  
Speaker  
Got me trying  
To reach ya  
Reach ya  
But I got to feature  
Feature  
My electric guitar  
Everytime  
I'm by you  
By you?  
Everytime  
I'm by him  
By him  
You're ripping up  
On the chords  
Playing my heart  
Electric guitar (9x)
