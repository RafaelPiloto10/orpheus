Black-eyed Susan  
You make us nervous  
Because we're very aware that you do not care  
  
Oh, Black-eyed Susan  
What don't you believe in?  
"No is always easier than Yes"  
Whoo !  
  
Black-eyed Susan  
You must insist :  
You are a born-again atheist, oh  
  
Oh, heavy-rings on  
Bitten fingers  
Black-eyed Susan sometimes  
Shakes to break  
So, watch it  
  
Oh...  
Black-eyed Susan  
Rest and do nothing  
'Cause it's the only thing that you do quite well  
Aah...  
  
Black-eyed Susan  
Rest and do nothing  
'Cause it's the only thing that you do quite well  
Aah...  
  
Black-eyed Susan  
Rest and do nothing  
'Cause it's the only thing that you do quite well  
Aah...  
  
Black-eyed Susan  
Please remember  
We were the first  
We were the first  
Oh...
