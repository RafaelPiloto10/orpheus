Oh honey babe, oh honey babe  
Oh honey babe, I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Honey babe, I like the way that you walk by  
I like the way you swing your eye  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Every night I like the way you beg for more  
And linger there outside the door  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Well, well, well-ll-ll ain't it swell  
Can't reveal-l-l how I feel  
And no one else could ever thrill me like you do  
You make my every dream come true  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Oh honey babe, oooo honey babe  
MMMMM honey babe  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
  
Honey baby I like the way you wear your clothes  
My love for you just grows and grows  
I like your kind of love  
Honey you know I do  
  
When you're near you don't know what you do to me  
And that's the way it oughta be  
I like your kind of love  
Honey you know I do  
  
Don't you know-o-o that I love you so  
Can't you see-e-e that you're for me  
Honey babe I like the way you hold my hand  
To make me know you understand  
I like your kind of love  
Honey you know I do  
Oh honey babe, oooo honey babe  
MMMMM honey babe  
I like your kind of love  
That's good, baby that's good  
Honey babe I like your kind of love  
  
FADE
