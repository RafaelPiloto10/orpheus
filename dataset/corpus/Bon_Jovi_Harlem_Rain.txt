Are. Sambora  
  
The old man down on the corner  
Is downing in his pain  
I can see the sorrow in his eyes  
His tears, the leave a stain  
The streets have left him broken  
Hes in the final phase  
Its been a long hard road  
From his glory days.  
Theres a tatoo of his sweetheart  
Fading on his arm  
He talks of painful tragedy  
How he lost his lucky charm  
His memory is clouded  
From the thunder in this vein  
Hes vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain.  
On desperation avenue  
The devil takes his toll  
Where the pushers and the poverty  
Slowly claim your soul  
When you reached the realization  
That you just can't break the chain, no  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain (harlem rain).  
In your seach for tender mercy  
No one seemed to care  
The faith that used to be your crutch  
Is now your cross to bear  
You last yourself so long ago  
You don't know who to blame  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.
