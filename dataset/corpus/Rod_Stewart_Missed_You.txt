Hey Pal, let me lean on you and talk awhile  
Your planes been delayed by the rain  
Or something  
I wouldn't even fly away  
If I had one good reason to stay  
But you said  
If you don't need my love  
I'm gonna find someone who does  
And I'm not hanging around  
This old heart is far to proud  
She got tired of me  
Staying out late everynight  
I'd fall up the stair  
Thought she'd always be there  
But suddenly I'm alone  
And I'm not accustomed to sleeping alone  
She said if you don't need my love  
I'm gonna find someone who does  
You've stripped me of everything  
And you've torn down all my dreams  
Its been two long weeks  
Since she's been gone  
Thought I had her in the palm of my hands  
She said I'm through, don't try to call me  
Cause you won't even find me  
Cause if you don't need my love  
I'm going to find someone who does  
And the heartache you've give me  
You'll get it back just wait and see  
Well, well, well, well  
I'd give anything to hold her in my bed again  
I just want to feel her breath on my back  
She said my blood can't give her love  
No way  
She said if you don't need my love  
I'm gonna find someone who does  
And I'm gonna take our child  
Cause I don't want him running wild  
Hey pal, I think they just called out your flight  
Put down your glass don't forget your boarding pass  
And if your looking or you found love  
Or sunshine that's enough  
Don't play hard to get  
Cause that ain't where its at  
Give her all your love  
Place her high above  
I missed you baby  
I missed you baby  
Yea I missed
