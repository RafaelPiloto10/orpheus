This world is full of strange behavior  
Every man has to be his own savior  
I know I can make it on my own if I try  
But I'm searchin' for a great heart  
To stand me by  
Underneath the African sky  
A great heart to stand me by  
  
Chorus  
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart  
To hold and keep me by  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
Under African sky  
Sometimes I feel that you barely know me  
Sometimes there's so much you can show me  
  
There's a highway of stars across the heavens  
There's a whispering song of the wind in the grass  
There's a rolling thunder across the savannah  
A hope and a dream at the edge of the sky  
And your life is the story of the wind  
Your life is a story like the wind  
  
Chorus  
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart  
To hold and stand me by  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
Under African sky  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
I see the fire in your eyes  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
That beats my name inside  
sometimes I feel that you really know me  
Sometimes there's so much you can show me  
(Chant)  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart  
To hold and stand me by  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
Under African sky  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
I see the fire in your eyes  
I'm searchin' for the spirit of the great heart  
That beats my name inside  
Sometimes I feel you really know me  
Sometimes there's so much you can show me  
  
Guk a 'mzimba (body grow old)  
Sala 'nhliziyo (but heart remain behind)
