May I have this dance  
I've been waitin' for this chance  
All night long (all night long)  
And this night I'll always treasure  
If I could have the pleasure  
To escort you  
  
Don't you know I've bit my nails in to  
Wantin' to dance with you  
But I was much too shy  
I never had the nerve  
Before you'd dance across the floor with another guy  
The way he held you in his arms  
With his many charms  
I knew my chances were slim  
In order to get to you  
There's only one thing to do  
So I got rid of him  
  
Hey  
Ooh hoo I told him that a girl  
By the name of pearl  
Was looking for him  
And when I turned around  
He was nowhere to be found  
  
So here I am  
Oh I gotta have this dance (gotta have this dance with you)  
Honey I (gotta have this dance with you)  
Honey I, honey I, honey I, have this dance  
Honey I (gotta have this dance with you)  
Gotta have this dance  
Oh
