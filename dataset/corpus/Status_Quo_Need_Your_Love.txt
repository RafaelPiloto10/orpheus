I need your love every day  
I need your love, need your love every day  
I need your love, need your love, need your love  
I need your love, need your love every day  
  
I, I need your love  
I, I see your love  
And now I'm here to take it  
I'm glad I've had your love  
It's not the greatest love  
But it's alright with me, alright with me  
  
I need your love every day  
I need your love, need your love every day  
I need your love every day  
I need your love, need your love, need your love  
  
My nights were getting longer  
My dreams were getting old  
I wasn't getting younger  
My bed was getting cold  
But it's all far behind me  
I'm a really satisfied man  
  
My nights were getting longer  
My dreams were getting old  
I wasn't getting younger  
My bed was getting cold  
But it's all far behind me  
I'm a really satisfied man  
  
I, I need your love  
I, I see your love  
And now I'm here to take it  
I'm glad I've had your love  
It's not the greatest love  
But it's alright for me, alright for me
