Seems to me like the days are getting longer  
For everyone there's no fun when there's no time to sleep  
Working on and on for a day in the sun  
Counting down the days to it stops (every day)  
Can you hear us?  
Watch the sun on my skin  
And the world that I'm in  
Makes me delirious  
Can you hear us?  
With a smile on my face  
And it's far to complete  
I'm delirious  
Can you hear us?  
Watch the sun on my skin  
And the world that I'm in  
Makes me delirious  
Can you hear us?  
With a smile on my face  
And it's far to complete  
I'm delirious  
Take me away make me a holiday!  
Delirious  
Take me away make me a holiday!  
Delirious  
Under the sun I feel I'm getting stronger  
Time to rewind my mind and recharge my batteries  
'Cause it takes so long  
And too soon it's gone  
Holding back the days to my reality (yeah)  
Take me away, make me a holiday  
Take me away, make me a holiday  
Delirious  
Can you hear us?  
Watch the sun on my skin  
And the world that I'm in  
Makes me delirious  
Can you hear us?  
With a smile on my face  
And it's far to complete  
I'm delirious  
Can you hear us?  
Watch the sun on my skin  
And the world that I'm in  
Makes me delirious  
Can you hear us?  
With a smile on my face  
And it's far to complete  
I'm delirious  
Ohh yeah yeah

Delirious  
Ohh ohh  
Ohh yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah
