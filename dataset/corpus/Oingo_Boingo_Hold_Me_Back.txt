Driving fast and ditching school, breaking all the precious rules.  
It's too hard, to make a living.  
I need a kick, I need a girl so badly I could scream.  
I'm sick of watching people on T.V.  
  
I feel the wind, in my face  
I need a car at the start of the race  
I need a highway and a beer  
If I don't stop now there's plenty to fear  
  
(Chorus)  
Hold Me back, oh won't you hold me back  
I can get violent any time  
Hold me back, I feel another attack  
Brewing deep inside  
Hold Me Back, oh won't you Hold me back.  
Hold Me Back, oh won't you hold me back  
Hold Me Back  
  
Teacher doesn't understand,  
Just how dangerous I am.  
I need a break, from the world  
Now more than ever, I need it good  
I need something I can taste  
And a vacation from the human race  
  
I need money, I need it bad  
If I don't have it, I get mad  
If I get mad I do such terrible things  
I get real crazy and I make girls scream.
