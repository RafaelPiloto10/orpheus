Why you always got to be so cool  
And why I always got to play your fool  
You don't really know what life's about  
Baby come and let your feelings out  
  
Say you really want me  
Don't keep it to yourself  
Say you really need me  
Just me and no one else  
Say you really love me  
Ooh let me know it's true  
Say you really want me  
The way that I want you tonight  
  
You don't know a thing about romance  
Deep inside you're scared to take the chance  
'Cause love like this may never come again  
Make your move or I'll be in the wind  
  
I need somebody through the thick and the thin  
'Cause I know the problems of today  
The time is over now for playing those games  
Lets take it all the way
