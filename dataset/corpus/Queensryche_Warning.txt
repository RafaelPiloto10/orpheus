I remember I was asking why  
And someday you said I'd know  
All these years, of fighting hard  
And now it's finally come too close  
  
I can't believe it's now happening to me  
Oh, couldn't it wait a few hundred years  
Destiny can't rest you see, now it's time  
Time to cry your tears! Now cry!  
  
The child of centuries, forgotten in time  
You talk in circles of rhyme  
Seer of places future and past  
The warning you gave us is surely our last  
  
Warning!  
Behold the child, his pointing hand  
Is raised in solemn grace  
His eyes once wide with learning wonder  
Now leave stains upon his face  
  
Now see the hands of the working man  
He's leaning back against the wall  
Once busy hands are idle now  
Standing ready for the fall! Our fall!  
  
The signs will come as days past by  
For those that claim to see  
The blind will stay not choosing to die  
Not believing the visions I've seen  
  
Warning!
