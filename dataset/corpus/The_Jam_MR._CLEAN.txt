Daylights dawns, you wake up and yawn - Mr. Clean  
A piece of toast from the one you love most - and you leave  
You get the bus in the eight o'clock rush  
And catch the train in the morning rain  
Mr. Clean - Mr. Clean  
  
If you see me in the street - look away  
'Cause I don't ever want to catch you looking at me - Mr. Clean  
'Cause I hate you and your wife  
And if I get the chance I'll fuck up your life  
Mr. Clean - etc.  
Is that seen!  
  
Surround yourself with dreams, of pretty young  
Girls, and anyone you want, but  
Please don't forget me or any of my kind  
'Cause I'll make you think again  
When I stick your face in the grind  
  
Getting pissed at the annual office do  
Smart blue suit and you went to Cambridge too  
You miss page three, but the Times is right for you  
And mum and dad are very proud of you  
Mr. Clean - etc.
