Every time I think of you  
I always catch my breath  
And I'm still standing here  
And you're miles away  
And I'm wondering why you left  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
I hear your name in certain circles  
And it always makes me smile  
  
I spend my time  
Thinking about you  
And it's almost driving me wild  
And there's a heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What I might say  
  
There's a message  
In the wild  
And I'm sending you  
This signal tonight  
  
You don't know  
How desperate I've become  
And it looks like I'm losing this fight  
In your world  
I have no meaning  
Though I'm trying hard  
To understand  
And it's my heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
And there's a message that I'm sending out  
Like a telegraph to your soul  
And if I can't bridge this distance  
Stop this heartbreak overload  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I keep lying to myself  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
Ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I keep lying to myself  
Ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
Ain't missing you  
  
Oh no  
No matter what my friends might say  
I ain't missing you
