WHO AM I  
Who am I to understand  
The ways of love a grain of sand  
To fall between these fingers  
That I hold  
Who am I that you should trust  
A wind that turns a stone to dust  
A mountain to surrender all its gold  
And who am I to say, you should believe in me  
And who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
Tell me who am I  
(DOUBLE VOICE)  
Who am I, I never knew  
My heart was roaming from or to  
(I don't know where we are going to)  
The different arms between my day and night  
(All I want is just to be with you)  
Who am I, a distant sun  
A thought before the moment's gone  
(Just a thought before the moment's gone)  
And I will never let you from my side  
(You will always be the only one)  
And all I have to say you can believe in me  
For who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
You are on my heart remembers  
Tell me who am I  
And who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love can not die  
Tell me who am I  
For who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
You are on my heart remembers  
Tell me who  
Tell me who am I
