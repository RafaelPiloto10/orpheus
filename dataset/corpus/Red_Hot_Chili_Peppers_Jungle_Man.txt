Deep inside the soul hole  
Of Mother Earth  
Father Time came  
With a supersonic supersonic burst  
His soul monkey sperm tribes  
Racing to be first  
Her ruby fruit jungle  
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth  
The baby was a boy  
But I think what stunned her  
Is that this bare breasted baby  
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder  
Crackin' from his thumb bone  
Came felonious thunder  
Fill the sky with hellfire  
From way down down down under  
  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I get all the bush I can  
  
Erupting from the ground  
In Hollywood he glowed  
His jungle turned to concrete  
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone  
Like a full blown volcano  
I must let it be known  
That through this boy's vein  
Atomic lava blood flows and flows  
His soul shocking sounds  
They make the mountains moan  
This boy's become a man  
It's time to take take take  
Take the throne  
  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I am a jungle man  
I get all the bush I can
