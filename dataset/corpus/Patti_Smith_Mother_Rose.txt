Mother rose Every little morn'  
To tend to me There she stood  
Waiting by the door Selflessly  
  
Took my hand Took it with a smile tenderly  
Mother rose Every little morn'  
To tend to me Now's the time  
To turn the view Now that I have you  
  
And I'll rise Every little morn'  
To tend to thee When you rise  
Open up your eyes You will see  
There I'll be Waiting by the door  
Come to me Take my hand  
Look into your heart There I'll be  
  
Now's the time To turn the view  
Now that I have you  
  
Now's the time To turn the view  
Now that I have you  
  
Roses growing by my door Climbing up the vine  
All the thorns and pain obscured Roses shall divine  
Where we feel no pain And the love inside  
Where roses climb Roses shall divine  
Roses shall divine Holy mother  
Mother of gold Mother with stories  
Told and retold She felt our tears  
Heard our sighs And turned to gold  
Before our eyes She rose into the light  
She rose into the light She rose into the light
