Saw a man who was fifty-one  
He bad married daughters and a single son  
And he's lost his job as this years begun  
And it broke my heart  
  
Saw his wife who was fifty-two  
She said she was sure they could make it through  
That her single wage would just have to do  
And it broke my heart  
  
Talked about it with the family now  
What began in sadness ended up a row  
All the guys with the clever mouths  
They were saying we should move south  
Saw the son who's been gone two weeks  
And he's down already with a job to seek  
And he's in Kings Cross and there's no-one speaking  
And it broke my heart.
