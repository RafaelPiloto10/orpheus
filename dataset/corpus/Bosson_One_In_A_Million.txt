Your one in a million, oh  
Your one in a million, woa oh  
One, one, one, one, one,  
  
Sometimes love can hit you everyday  
Sometimes you can fall for everyone you see  
But only one can really make me stay  
The sign, the one in the sky, has said to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Your one in a million  
Your once in a lifetime  
You made me discover one of the stars above us  
Your one in a million  
Your once in a lifetime  
You made me discover one of the stars above us  
  
I've been looking for that special one  
I've been searching for someone to give me love  
When I thought that all the hope was gone  
A smile and there you were and I was gone  
I always will remember how I felt that day  
A feeling indescribable to me, yeah  
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer  
And you, your the one, the one for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the beginning I was cool and everything was possible  
They tried to catch me but it was impossible  
No one could hurt me it was my game  
Until I met you baby and it wasn't the same  
When you didn't want me, I wanted you  
Because the funny thing about it is I like the show  
I like it when it's difficult I like it when it's hard  
Then you know it's worth it that you find your heart  
(Whoa)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your one in a million
