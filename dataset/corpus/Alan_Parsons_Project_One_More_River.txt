Don't look back 'cause there's one more river.  
Don't turn your back, you got one more river to cross.  
No more fightin', no more dyin',  
No more cheatin', no more lyin'.  
  
Don't look back 'cause there's one more river.  
Don't turn your back, you got one more river to cross.  
Don't start askin' the rhyme or reason,  
Don't hold back, it's the time of the season.  
  
One more mile and one more road...  
One last bridge and one less load...  
One  
More  
River...  
  
Don't look back you got one more river!  
Don't turn your back, you got one more river to cross...  
Don't start askin' the rhyme or reason,  
Don't hold back, it's the time of the season!  
  
One more mile and one more road...  
One last bridge and one less load...  
One more river.  
One more river!
