My father always said that there's no free ride  
You've got to make a sacrifice  
With so many Prophets on the Lord's side  
Even your soul has got a price  
But talk is cheap it takes money to buy your freedom  
And the tax man's knockin' at your door  
  
[Chorus]  
Spend it while you can  
Money's contraband  
You can't take it with you when you go  
Spend it while you can  
Before it's taken from your hand  
There's no free ride in this carnival world  
  
Too many hawkers on this travelin' show  
Everybody's got something to sell  
Bootleg Swatches, cardboard Gucci gear  
Watch your step at the wishing well  
  
What's mine is mine  
If it's only one thin dime  
My cash has always meant to flow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Spend it while you can, etc..........  
There's no free ride in this carnival world.  
  
But talk is cheap it takes money to buy your freedom  
And the tax man's knockin' at your door.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Spend it while you can....  
... there's no free ride in this carnival world.  
There's no free ride in this carnival world.
