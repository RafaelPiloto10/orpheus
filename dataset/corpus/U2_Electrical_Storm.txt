The sea, it swells like a sore head  
And the night, it is aching  
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed  
And the day, it is breaking  
  
On rainy days we go swimming out  
On rainy days swimming in the sound  
On rainy days we go swimming out  
  
You're in my mind all of the time  
I know that's not enough  
If the sky can crack there must be some way back  
For love and only love  
  
Car alarm won't let you back to sleep  
You're kept awake dreaming someone else's dream  
Coffee is cold, but it'll get you through  
Compromise, that's nothing new to you  
  
Let's see colors that have never been seen  
Let's go to places no one else has been  
  
You're in my mind all of the time  
I know that's not enough  
But if the sky can crack there must be some way back  
To love and only love  
  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Baby, don't cry  
  
It's hot as hell, honey, in this room  
Sure hope the weather will break soon  
The air is heavy, heavy as a truck  
We need the rain to wash away our bad luck  
  
Well, if the sky can crack, there must be some way back  
For love and only love  
  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry
