I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you  
  
Can't you see my darling  
That the harder I try  
The more we grow apart  
Please believe me  
The sweeter the kiss  
The colder turn your arms  
And the colder grows your heart  
And baby more I love you  
  
I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you  
  
I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you  
  
And you're in my heart my darling  
The closer I get  
The more you're out of love  
Don't you feel it  
The colder your touch  
The more it turns me on  
And the faster beats my heart  
And baby more I love you  
  
I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you  
  
I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you  
  
I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you  
  
I see it in your eyes  
I feel it in your touch  
I taste it from your lips  
And baby more I love you
