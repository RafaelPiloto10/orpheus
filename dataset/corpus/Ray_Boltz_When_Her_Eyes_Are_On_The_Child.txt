When Her Eyes Are On The Child  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Theres a mother whose name is Mary  
And shes traveled very far  
But shes not thinking  
About her journey now  
Theres a baby in her arms  
And when her eyes are on the child  
She finds all the strength she needs  
All the struggles and the trials  
Just turn into perfect peace  
She can even stop and smile  
When her eyes are on the child  
Theres a soldier whose name is Terry  
And hes serving far from home  
Its the first time  
That hes spent Christmas  
Far away and all alone  
And when his eyes are on the child  
He finds all the strength he needs  
All the struggles and the trials  
Just turn into perfect peace  
He can even stop and smile  
When his eyes are on the child  
Theres a world of lonely people  
Chasing love and chasing styles  
Oh but how different their lives could be  
With their eyes upon the child  
And when our eyes are on the child  
We find all the strength we need  
All the struggles and the trails  
Just turn into perfect peace  
We can even stop and smile  
When our eyes are on the child  
We can even stop and smile  
When our eyes are on the child
