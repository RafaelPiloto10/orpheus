Rappin on a dead mic, hot lyrics comin from me  
People thinks i'ma sic, nah i'm just tha shy A-Double-B  
Remanissin yesterday i was holdin ma hennessey  
Roled and got shot, what happend to hiphop  
Tha hood is cold, everybody's findin someone to kill  
Fuckas don't know how i feel, poor childrens need some meal  
Lets find tha one who can heal, i'm tryna take care ma family  
Fightin for tha fame luvin this rap game  
Damn that's ma fantisy, but everybody's sayin to me that  
School is nessecery, makin music is a secondery  
I'm thinkin about stoppin? but many says i should fight?  
Shiit, i'm rappin on a dead mic  
  
Chours.  
  
In Tha Hood,  
Some Say I'm Good,

I'm Rappin On A Dead Mic

Cant stop makin music, lyrics comin to me like i'm nobody strange  
Tryin to be famous, it's only ma life that is'nt glarious  
Tryin to be good, tryin to forget that time wer A-Double-B

You remember me, from Rais to Outlaw  
New album (Guess Whos Back), that's what i'ma bout more  
Even if death come to me, i aint got nothin to fear  
And i know there's gon happend some wrong this year

Nobody can stop tha music and tha hood need rap  
Fuck them bitches sayin it's crap  
We raised up for a rapper, like Pac  
Rest in peace but still he rock  
Niggaz think i don't got something to say, so listen here  
Everyday i'm workin tryin to make ma songs pay  
I just wanna be heard, fuckas don't let me earn mine  
When you're a bad boy haters don't wanna see you shine  
So much pressure in this life of mine  
I cry times, Allah please show me tha right sign  
There's no one i can find, i smoked and got high  
I think i did it for maintain  
Now i just wanna be with ma homies if some of em remains  
I can't ride, i can only see that tha rain is fallin in ma eyes  
  
Chours.  
  
In Tha Hood,  
Some Say I'm Good,  
Some Say I'm Bad,  
Some don't Say That,  
And, Some Say I'ma Sic,  
That's Because I'm Rappin On A Dead Mic
