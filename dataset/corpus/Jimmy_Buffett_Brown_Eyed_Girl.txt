Hey, where did we go?  
Days when the rains came  
Down in a hollow  
Playin' a new game  
  
Laughin' and a runnin'  
Skippin' and a jumpin'  
In the misty mornin' fog  
With our hearts a thumpin'  
It was you, my brown eyed girl  
You, my brown eyed girl  
  
Now what ever happened  
Tuesday is oh so slow  
Goin' down the old mine  
With a transistor radio  
  
Standin' in a sunlit lane  
Hidin' 'hind a rainbow's wall  
Slippin' and a slidin'  
All along the waterfall  
It was you, my brown eyed girl  
You, my brown eyed girl  
  
Do you remember when  
We used to sing  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da  
  
So hard to find my way  
Now that I'm on my own  
Thought about it just the other day  
My, where's the time all gone  
  
Can't remember back then Lord  
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout  
Makin' love in the green grass  
Behind the stadium  
With you, my brown eyed girl  
Do you remember when  
We used to sing  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da
