If you leave, don't leave now  
Please don't take my heart away  
Promise me just one more night  
Then we'll go our separate ways  
With hours left time on our sides  
Now it's fading fast  
Every second every moment  
We've got to--we've gotta make it last  
  
I touch you once I touch you twice  
I won't let go at any price  
I need you now like I need you then  
You always said we'd still be friends someday  
  
If you leave I won't cry  
I won't waste one single day  
But if you leave don't look back  
I'll be running the other way  
Seven years went under the bridge  
Like time was standing still  
Heaven knows what happens now  
You've got to--you've gotta say you will  
  
I touch you once I touch you twice  
I won't let go at any price  
I need you now like I needed you then  
You always said we'd meet again  
  
I touch you once I touch you twice  
I won't let go at any price  
I need you now like I needed you then  
You always said we'd still be friends  
  
I touch you once I touch you twice  
I won't let go at any price  
I need you now like I needed you then  
You always said we'd meet again someday  
  
If you leave  
Oh if you leave  
Oh if you leave  
Don't look back  
Don't look back
