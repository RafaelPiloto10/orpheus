A taste of honey  
  
Tastin' much sweeter than wine  
  
  
  
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart  
  
And lingers still, though we're far apart  
  
A taste of honey (honey, honey)  
  
Tastin' much sweeter  
  
  
  
I dream of your first kiss, and then  
  
I feel upon your lips and then  
  
A taste of honey (honey, honey)  
  
Tastin' much sweeter  
  
  
  
I will return, yes I will return  
  
I'll come back for the honey  
  
  
  
break  
  
  
  
Well I will return, yes I will return  
  
I'll come back  
  
For the honey  
  
And you  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa you  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa you  
  
Whoa, whao, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa you
