What's it all about  
Alfie  
  
Is it just for the moment we live  
What's it all about  
When you sort it out  
Alfie  
  
Are we meant to take more than we give  
Or are we meant to be kind  
And if only fools are kind  
Alfie  
  
Then I guess  
It is wise to be cruel  
And if life belongs  
Only to the strong  
Alfie  
  
What will you lend on  
An old golden rule  
As sure as I believe  
There's a heaven above  
Alfie  
  
I know there's something much more  
Something even non-believers  
Can believe in  
I believe in love  
  
Alfie  
Without true love you just exist  
Alfie  
  
Until you find the love you've missed  
You're nothing  
Alfie  
  
When you walk let your heart lead the way  
And you'll find love any day  
Alfie  
Alfie  
Alfie
