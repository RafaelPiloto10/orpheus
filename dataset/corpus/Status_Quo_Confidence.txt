( bown )  
All she needs is a little confidence  
All she knows is to run and hide  
Through a lifetime of knocking back  
Oh don't do this you can't do that  
But she never learned to interact  
All she needs is confidence  
All she learned was a little self-defence  
Looking out over number one  
She's been diving and ducking round  
In and out the lost and found  
But it never laid her to the ground  
All she needs is something to believe  
Sweet security  
All she needs tries so hard to please  
But all she really all she really needs  
Is confidence  
No chance of keeping her close to me  
No sense abusing her liberty  
Through a lifetime of knocking back  
Oh don't do this you can't do that  
But she never learned to interact  
All she needs is something to believe  
Sweet security  
All she needs tries so hard to please  
All she really all she really needs  
Is confidence
