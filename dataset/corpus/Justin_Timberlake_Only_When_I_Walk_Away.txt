Girl this little game you play  
Don't stop 'till you run too far  
So what's a man like me to say?  
With a bullet laying in my heart  
Damn girl, we go from so hot to so cold  
What am I gonna do about this damn love  
Is that shit in sync or insane, love  
I guess that's the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
What's that, baby, what you say?  
You the one to light up this torch  
'Cause I'm burning down all the way  
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more  
Damn love, how did the sound get so amped up  
Turn off and silence this damn love  
Is that shit insane or in sync, girl  
I guess that's the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
You should see the look on your face  
Baby when I finish what you start  
but I can't hear a word you say  
With a bullet laying in your heart  
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands love  
I laid you to rest you said damn love  
This shit's insane, it's insane love  
Ain't that the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
Only when I walk away  
  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
Only when I walk away  
Only when I walk away  
What am I gonna do with all this damn love  
What am I gonna do with all this  
Only when I walk away  
Only when I walk away  
  
She only love me when I walk away
