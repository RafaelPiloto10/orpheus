She dresses in leather  
She isn't too together  
She looks then she lowers her eyes at me  
  
She smokes cigarettes  
She likes to get wet  
And she's about a woman as a woman can be I said  
  
That girl is rock 'n' roll  
She got the cutest figure  
I think it's gettin' bigger  
She's about, hangin' out, over me  
  
She feels just right  
In the middle of the night  
'N' she's about a woman as a woman can be I said  
  
That girl is rock 'n' roll
