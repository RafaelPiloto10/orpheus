There's a place for us,  
Somewhere a place for us.  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us Somewhere.  
  
There's a time for us,  
Someday a time for us,  
Time together with time to spare,  
Time to learn, time to care,  
Some day! Somewhere.  
  
We'll find a new way of living,  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us,  
A time and place for us.  
  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.  
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere!  
  
Some day! Somewhere.  
We'll find a new way of living, We'll find a way of  
Forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us,  
A time and place for us.  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.  
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere!
