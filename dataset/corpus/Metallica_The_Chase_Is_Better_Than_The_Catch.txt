The Chase is Better Than the Catch  
(Metallica - Miscellaneous)  
  
You know I'm bad, the times I've had  
I've gotta bad reputation  
I don't care, I get my share  
Don't feel no deprivation  
The more I get the better it is  
I like it fine, Like a little whizz  
Treat'em like ladies, that's a fact  
You know the chase is better than the catch  
  
Silver tongued devil, deamon leach  
You know just what I'm doing  
I like a little innocent bitch  
You know I ain't just screwing  
I love you baby, love you too much  
I like you fine I feel your touch  
But your appearance don't hold no class  
You know the chase is better than the catch  
  
A little beauty I love you madly  
Come on home with me  
I know you're hot, I know what you've got  
You know I want to shake your tree  
Come on honey touch me right there  
Come on honey don't you get scared  
Come on honey let me get you in the sack  
You know the chase is better than the catch
