We both went a little crazy  
We both did each other wrong  
Don't think it's too late baby  
Don't think that all hope is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
We need a little more love  
To get us through the night  
Just a little more love  
And we'll be all right  
  
It'd be easy to say it doesn't matter  
To walk away and wish you the best  
But I know we'd feel a whole lot better  
If we tried a little tenderness  
  
Let's put our differences aside  
We can make it baby you and I  
Let's give it just one more try  
We can't let this thing die
