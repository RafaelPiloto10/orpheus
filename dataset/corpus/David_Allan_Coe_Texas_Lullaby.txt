See those tumbleweeds a blowin' Lord it makes me want to cry  
It reminds me of my daddy and that Texas Lullaby  
See those cactus flowers bloomin' like the twinkle in his eye  
Every time he started singin' the old Texas Lullaby  
Yipee yi little doggie roll along roll along  
Yipee yi little doggie take me home take me home  
It's so cold on the desert I'm chilled to the bone  
Yipee yi little doggie yipee yi  
  
Looky yonder there's a dust cloud paintin' picture in the sky  
Daddy told me all about it in that Texas Lullaby  
Them old longhorns are a ballin' Lord I know I must be high  
Wish my dad could hear me singin' this old Texas Lullaby  
Yipee yi little doggie...  
[ mandolin - dobro ]  
Daddy left me this old guitar though I never quite knew why  
He said someday I'd be famous like that Texas Lullaby  
But it's been a month of Sundays since I seen that eagle fly  
And nobody wants to listen to a Texas Lullaby  
Yipee yi little doggie  
Yipee yi little doggie yipee yi yipee yi
