Boy I see ya, looking at me  
I feel your eyes on me, like you gotta have me  
Watching every move, like it's for you  
You can't help it, you attracted like a magnet  
My love ain't easy  
You gon' have to put in some work  
You can't buy me a drink, thinking I'ma fall for your flirt  
You gotta make it right  
If you wanna go spend some time  
You gotta raise the bar tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Love me, baby treat me right  
Make it eternity and not only one night  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
So now love me, baby treat me right  
And we'll be riding it from morning til midnight  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
Night of your life, life, life  
Night of your life, life, life  
  
I could have ya, if I wanted to  
Down on one knee, in front of me where them bells ringing  
I could claim ya, be your savior  
Wrap your heart inside of these arms and you'll never leave  
I could have your hands tied, round my body all up on me  
Boy you'll be stuck to me, if I wanted with no release  
I'll have you begging, wishing now I give you a piece  
Baby you'll never be the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Taller than a mountain, deeper than the sea  
You're boiling hot for me babe, one hundred degrees  
I want you to love me like your favorite dream  
Let's make tonight a reality  
  
So now love me, baby treat me right  
And we'll be riding it from morning til midnight  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
Night of your life, life, life  
Night of your life, life, life  
Night of your life, life, life
