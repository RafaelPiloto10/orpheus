The world outside don't like us much,  
'Cause they ain't got our classy touch,  
But they ain't good enough to breathe,  
This towns good air we make 'em leave.  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it's no, no, no, you really can't do that,  
No, no, no, down home town.  
  
No monkey business in this town,  
Well who do you think you're pushing round,  
This towns respectable and clean,  
Just look around you'll see what I mean.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Down home town, down home town,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We got the best town band around,  
Just listen to their crazy sound.  
When they get hot they gonna blow,  
You see them winnin' every show.  
Down home town, down home town [Repeat]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look out
