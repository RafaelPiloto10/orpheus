The walls of my mind are closin' in.  
Can't get away.  
Your mem'ry won't end.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.  
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
I never stop hearin' the music after the song is through.  
I still see your eyes, your warm, gentle smile.  
It was all worthwhile, each moment we knew.  
[Chorus]
