Can't get the stink off,  
He's been hanging around for days  
Comes like a comet,  
Suckered you but not your friends  
  
One day he'll get to you,  
Teach you how to be a holy cow  
  
[Chorus]  
You do it to yourself you do  
And that's what really hurts is  
You do it to yourself just you,  
You and no-one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
Don't get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor  
You've changed the locks 3 times,  
He still comes reeling through the door  
One day I will get to you  
And Teach you how to get to purest hell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]
