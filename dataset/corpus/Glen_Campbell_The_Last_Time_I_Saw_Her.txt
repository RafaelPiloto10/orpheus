The last time I saw her face  
Her eyes were bathed in starlight  
And her hair hung long  
The last time she spoke to me  
Her lips were like the scented flowers  
Inside a rain-drenched forest  
But that was so long ago  
That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before  
And if time could heal the wounds  
I would tear the threads away  
That I might bleed some more  
The last time I walked with her  
Her laughter was the steeple bells  
That ring to greet the morning sun  
A voice that called to everyone  
To love the ground we walked upon  
Those were good days  
The last time I held her hand  
Her touch was autumn spring  
And summer and winter too  
The last time I let go of her  
She walked away into the night  
I lost her in the misty streets  
A thousand months, a thousand years  
When other lips will kiss her eyes  
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is  
The last time I saw her face  
Her eyes were bathed in starlight  
And she walked alone  
The last time she kissed my cheek  
Her lips were like the wilted leaves  
Upon the autumn covered hills  
Resting on the frozen ground  
The seeds of love lie cold and still  
Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten
