I can't wait to get home to you  
I got so much work to do, work, work  
Oh, come on work me baby, come on home, oh  
Come on work me baby, oh  
  
I'm taking care of business, baby can't you see  
I've gotta make it for you and gotta make it for me  
Sometimes it seems boy I'm neglecting you  
Well I'd love to spend more time  
I got so many things to do  
  
Oh, I, I got work to do  
I got work baby  
I got a job baby  
I got work to do  
Said I got work to do  
  
Oh, I'm out here trying to make it  
Baby can't you see  
It takes a lot of money to make it  
Let's talk truthfully  
So keep your love light burnin'  
Oh, you've gotta have a little faith  
You might as well get used to me  
Coming home a little late  
  
Oh, I can't wait to get home to you  
I got so much work to do,  
Work, work, baby, work, work  
  
Oh, I can't wait to get home to you  
I got so much work to do,  
Work, work, baby, work, work  
  
I got a v-a-n-e-double s-a  
She's out to give a scene  
We used to eat together  
Now it's candlelight tv  
But woman, work it out, 'till the job's done  
Cause it's not the one to flip on his dip, double or one  
So I come to your buns like a frankfurter  
Accepted in more circles than a shot putter  
I suppose you, I surely support you  
'Till the course another fader  
You're off to work I can dig it -- later  
  
Oh, I, I got work to do  
I got work baby  
I got a job sugar  
I got work to do  
  
Oh, I can't wait to get home to you  
I got so much work to do,  
Work, work, baby, work, work  
  
Oh, I can't wait to get home to you  
I got so much work to do,  
Work, work, baby, work, work  
  
Oh, I can't wait to get home to you  
I got so much work to do,  
Work, work, baby, work, work
