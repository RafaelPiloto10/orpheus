Come on and hear, come on and hear  
Alexander's Ragtime Band  
Come on and hear, come on and hear  
It's the best band in the land  
  
They can play a bugle call  
Like you never heard before  
So natural that you want to go to war  
  
That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb  
  
Come on along, come on along  
Let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man, up to the man  
Who's the leader of the band  
  
And if you want to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime  
  
Come on and hear, come on and hear  
Alexander's Ragtime Band
