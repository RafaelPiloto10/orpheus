Didn't you know  
I was waiting on you  
Waiting on a dream  
That'll never come true  
Didn't you know  
I was waiting on you  
My face turned to stone  
When I heard the news  
  
[Chorus]  
When you decide to break the rules  
'Cause I just heard some real bad news  
  
People will talk  
Like its old news  
I played it off and act like I already knew  
Let me ask you  
How long have you known too  
You played it off and act like he's brand new  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Real bad news  
Real bad news  
Real bad news  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep another no you wont  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep it like you never knew  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep another love for you  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep it like you never knew  
  
While I'm waiting on a dream  
That'll never come true  
  
Oh you just gonna  
Keep it like you never knew  
  
My face turned to stone  
When I heard the news  
  
Whats on the news  
Channel cruise
