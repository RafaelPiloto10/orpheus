Operator, well could you help me place this call?  
See, the number on the matchbook is old and faded  
She's living in L. A. with my best old ex-friend Ray  
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated  
  
Isn't that the way they say it goes?  
Well, let's forget all that  
And give me the number if you can find it  
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show  
I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well  
I only wish my words could just convince myself  
That it just wasn't real  
But that's not the way it feels  
  
Operator, could you help me place this call?  
Well, I can't read the number that you just gave me  
There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time  
I think about a love that I thought would save me  
  
Isn't that the way they say it goes?  
Well, let's forget all that  
And give me the number if you can find it  
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show  
I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well  
I only wish my words could just convince myself  
That it just wasn't real  
But that's not the way it feels  
  
Operator, let's forget about this call  
You see there's no one there I really wanted to talk to  
Thank you for your time, ah, you've been so much more than kind  
And you can keep the dime  
  
Isn't that the way they say it goes?  
Well, let's forget all that  
And give me the number if you can find it

I only wish my words could just convince myself  
That it just wasn't real
