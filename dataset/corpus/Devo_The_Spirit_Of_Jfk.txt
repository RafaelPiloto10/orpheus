Let the word go forth  
Let the word go forth  
From this time and place  
  
Good evening my fellow citizens  
I'm speaking tonight in a spirit of hope  
In the human spirit, the human spirit  
  
Lee harvey oswald  
Oh, no  
Jack ruby  
Oswald and ruby  
Oh, no  
  
To friend and foe alike  
Oswald and ruby  
  
My god, have you heard  
The president is dead  
  
Oswald and ruby  
They do not imprison spirits  
Oswald and ruby  
They do not imprison spirits  
The president is dead  
  
Well, I know where that 3rd shot came from  
The grassy knoll  
Behind the picket fence  
  
The energy, the faith, the function  
Which we bring to this endeavor  
We'll fight our country and all who serve it  
And the glow from that fire  
Can truly light the world  
  
History will record the facts  
I didn't shoot anybody  
  
Lee harvey oswald  
Why should anybody serve?  
Why should anybody serve?  
Jack harvey oswald  
  
We have learned in times past  
The spirit of one moment or place  
Can be gone in the next
