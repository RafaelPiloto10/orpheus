Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?  
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?  
I'm glad I opened your eyes  
The have-nots would have tried to freeze you in ice  
  
Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?  
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow?  
Well I was just passing the time  
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine?  
  
Tell me a story about how you adore me  
Live through the shadow, see through the shadow,  
Live through the shadow, tear at the shadow  
Hate in the shadow, love in the shadow life  
  
Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow?  
Have they had another baby, standing in the shadow?  
Where have you been all your life?  
Talking about all the people who would try anything twice  
  
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?  
Has she had another baby, standing in the shadow?  
You take your choice at this time  
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline
