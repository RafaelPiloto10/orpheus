"No Women Allowed!"  
Let me tell you about this love and hate relation  
Between a man and a woman  
And so none of you all get the wrong interpretation  
I can't live with them  
I'm gonna die without them  
  
Sooner or later  
You'll be a he man woman hater  
It's inevitable  
And to become one  
You've gotta really hate to love them  
He man woman hater  
He, he man woman hater  
You know I love to hate cause I hate to love them  
  
He man's behavior  
Doesn't need no explanation  
We all got a one track mind  
He men have always had a sexual preoccupation  
It's gonna be your place or it's gonna be mine  
  
Sooner or later  
You'll be a he man woman hater  
It's inevitable  
And to become one  
You've gotta really hate to love them  
He man woman hater  
He, he man woman hater  
You know I love to hate cause I hate to love them  
He, he man woman hater  
Can't live with em gonna die without 'em
