The old home town looks the same  
As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa  
Down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly  
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly  
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Then I awake and look around me  
At four gray walls that surround me  
And I realize I was only dreamin'  
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre  
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again  
I'll touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old tree  
As I lay me in the green, green grass of home
