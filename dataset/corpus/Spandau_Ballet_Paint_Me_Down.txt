Paint me down  
Paint me down  
Paint me down  
I'm walking into studio  
Consider strange appeal  
Paint me in the home  
I'm brushing up on sketchbook  
Designs for love, unreal  
Paint me in the home  
Oil and skin, you'll need to buy it  
Consider what I mean  
She sinks beneath the moving pictures  
Prepare the brush for me  
I'm craving with this need  
Paint me down  
Paint me down  
Paint me down  
I'm soaking up the surface  
Conceiving new idea  
Paint me in the home  
She's oiling up her subject  
But all still life is here  
Paint me in the home  
All the boys with framed dimension  
A cover up on lust  
He'll take his pain and paint it over  
Prepare the brush for me  
I'm craving with this need  
Paint me down  
Paint me down  
Paint me down
