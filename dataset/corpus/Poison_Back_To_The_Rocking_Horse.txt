All the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Ain't got a hope in hell  
Of puttin' my pieces back together again  
  
I've seen things in my life that should never be seen  
I'm talkin' things that'd make your skin crawl  
I want to go back to a simpler time  
Where nothin' really mattered at all  
  
You see, I can't sleep all night long  
Tossin' and a-turnin'  
thoughts they keep a-churnin'  
I can't sleep all night long  
As a matter of fact  
I just want to get back  
  
[Chorus]  
Back to the rockin' horse  
Back to where it all began  
Take me back-back to the rockin' horse  
And start all over again  
  
My parents think I'm crazy  
And the doctor says I cracked  
But they don't understand me  
Cause I just want to go back  
  
You see I can't sleep all night long  
Tossin' and a-turnin  
Thoughts they keep a-churnin'  
I can't sleep all night long  
As a matter of fact  
I just want to get back  
  
[Chorus]
