Suspicions rising, answers aren't clear  
I thought we made a promise, now you've disappeared  
You seem to lead two lives at a time  
Do I still fit in, I thought you were mine  
Sitting at the bar in our favorite cafe  
I turn and see ya laughin' with her and your smile fades away  
Didn't surprise me, there's nothin' left to say  
I caught you red-handed now and you can't walk away  
CHORUS:  
You were caught in the act  
When you thought I wasn't lookin' at ya  
C.I.T.A., I can see what you're doin'  
Caught in the act, and I can't stand to hear your lies  
Caught in the act, don't you try and change my mind  
You called me the only, you said, "she's only a friend"  
Don't pretend you're sorry, my heart will mend  
Don't you come back to me, don't you try to call  
You couldn't hold my heart with love, now you can't hold me at all  
CHORUS  
Caught in the act, caught in the act  
Caught in the act, C.I.T.A.  
Caught in the act, caught in the act  
Caught in the act, C.I.T.A.
