So now you've caught on  
Hey baby, where do you, comin' from  
Boy she looked at me and smiled,  
And looked into space  
And she said, 'i'm comin' from the land of new rising sun'  
And I said, 'hey, baby where you tryin' to go to'  
Then she says, 'i'm gonna spread around peace of mind  
And a whole lotta love to you and you'  
Hey girl I'd like to come along  
Yes, I'd love to come along  
'would you like to come along? '  
She asked me  
'yes take me along right now.'  
Hey baby, can I step into your world a while?  
'yes you can' she said  
'come on back with me for a while  
We're gonna go across the jupiter sun  
And see all your people on by one  
You gotta help your people out right now  
That's what I'm doin' it all about'  
'yeah yeah, may I come along?  
May I come along?  
May I come along?  
Yeah yeah  
Please take me'
