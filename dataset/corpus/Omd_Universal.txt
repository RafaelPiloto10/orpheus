It doesn't matter if you're black or white  
Or the God that you choose to pray to  
It doesn't matter about the clothes you wear  
Or which creator made you  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die there's no heaven above  
It's universal, it's universal  
  
It doesn't matter who you think you are  
You're living and you know you feel it  
It's not important as to why we're here  
You know there is no reason  
  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die there's no heaven above  
It's universal, it's universal  
It's universal, it's universal  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die there's no heaven above  
It's universal, it's universal  
It's universal, it's universal
