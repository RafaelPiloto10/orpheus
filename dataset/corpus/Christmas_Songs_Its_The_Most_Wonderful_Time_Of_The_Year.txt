(Eddie Pola, George Wyle, 1963)  
  
It's the most wonderful time of the year.  
With the kids jingle belling,  
And everyone telling you,  
"Be of good cheer,"  
It's the most wonderful time of the year.  
  
There'll be parties for hosting,  
Marshmallows for toasting and  
Caroling out in the snow.  
There'll be scary ghost stories and  
Tales of the glories of Christmases  
Long, long ago.  
  
It's the most wonderful time of the year.  
There'll be much mistletoeing  
And hearts will be glowing,  
When loved ones are near.  
It's the most wonderful time of the year
