And the road becomes my bride  
I have stripped of all but pride  
So in her I do confide  
And she keeps me satisfied  
Gives me all I need  
And with dust in throat I crave  
Only knowledge will I save  
To the game you stay a slave  
  
Rover, wanderer  
Nomad, vagabond  
Call me what you will  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
Free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll redefine anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
  
And the earth becomes my throne  
I adapt to the unknown  
Under wandering stars I've grown  
By myself but not alone  
I ask no one  
  
And my ties are severed clean  
The less I have the more I gain  
Off the beaten path I reign  
Rover, wanderer  
Nomad, vagabond  
Call me what you will  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll never mind anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll redefine anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
Carved upon my stone  
My body lie, but still I roam  
Wherever I may roam
