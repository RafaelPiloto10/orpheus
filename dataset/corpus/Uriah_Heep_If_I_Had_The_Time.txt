If I had the time  
To re-live my life  
I don't think I'd care  
To change a thing  
As long as I find  
Just a little peace of mind  
I can dream and laugh  
And I can sing  
  
I can have my fun  
With the silver stars  
I can watch the sun  
Fall in the sea  
And if it rains  
I will smile just the same  
For the rain  
Will make the flowers sing  
  
I know how it is to feel sad  
I know how it is when things go bad  
But I'm sure that  
I have found the way  
I'm happy here and here I'll stay  
Here I'll stay
