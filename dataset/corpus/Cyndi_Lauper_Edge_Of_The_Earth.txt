I spent a lot of time looking for me in your eyes  
I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the end of our bed  
Then I realize that this time, time won't tell  
People like myself can't compromise this well  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
Said a lot of words that you never wanted to hear  
Used myself up trying to explain and be clear  
Then I realize we mean the things we say  
When you turn the page the words don't go away  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
Christopher Columbus aint got much on me  
And maybe just like Moses, I will part the sea  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
No, I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
I won't let go, just wait and see...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...
