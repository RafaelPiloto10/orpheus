Gordon Lightfoot  
Sang a song  
About a boat  
That sank in the lake  
At the break  
Of the morning,  
A Cat named Stevens  
Found a faith  
He could believe in  
And Joan Baez  
I never listened  
To too much jazz,  
But hippie songs  
Could be heard  
In our pad  
Eddie Rabbitt sang  
About how much  
He loved a rainy night,  
Abba, Devo, Benatar  
Were there day  
John Lennon died,  
Mr. Springsteen said  
He had a hungry heart  
Grover Washington  
Was happy on the day  
He topped the charts  
These are the songs  
  
[Chorus]  
These are my heart songs  
They never feel wrong  
And when I wake  
For goodness sake  
These are the songs  
I keep singin'  
  
Quiet Riot got me started  
With the bangin' on my head  
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest  
And Slayer  
Taught me how to shred  
I gotta admit though  
Sometimes  
I would listen  
To the radio  
Debbie Gibson  
Tell me that you think  
We're all alone  
Michael Jackson's  
In the mirror  
I've gotta have faith  
If I wanna see clear  
Never gonna give you up  
Wish me love  
Or wishing well  
It takes two to make  
A thing go right  
If the Fresh Prince  
Starts a fight  
Don't you worry  
For too long  
'Cause you know  
These are the songs  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back in 1991  
I wasn't havin' any fun  
Till my roommate said  
"Come on and put  
A brand new record on"  
Had a baby on it  
He was naked on it  
Then I heard the chords  
That broke the chains  
I had upon me  
Got together with my bros  
In some rehearsal studios  
Then we played  
Our first rock show  
And watched the fan base  
Start to grow  
Signed the deal that gave  
The dough to make  
A record of our own  
The song come  
On the radio  
Now people go  
This is the song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat x4]  
These are the songs  
I keep singing
