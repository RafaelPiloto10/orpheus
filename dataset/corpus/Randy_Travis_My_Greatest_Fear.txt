Sometimes many miles may lay between us  
But only for the job I choose to do  
And what part helps me through my darkest hours,  
Each mile brings me closer to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Please believe you're all I ever wanted  
If you should leave I don't know what I'd do  
I'd be like a child afraid of darkness  
The greatest fear I have is losing you  
  
Heaven knows I've always had these demons  
watchin for a place to take control  
Whispering you'll never be there for me  
Waiting at the end of my road  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Alone I wander through this world, no meaning in my life  
Then I found you and finally saw the light  
  
[Chorus]
