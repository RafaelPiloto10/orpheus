Do you hear  
What I hear,  
Or can I have been deceived ?  
Voices singing,  
Bells are ringing,  
They say  
He'll come back to me.  
  
Though he's gone,  
In my sleep  
As if he were here with me,  
He'll be back now,  
I can tell now,  
You'll see,  
He'll come back to me.  
  
Once more, once more,  
Tell me that he's still sure.  
I know, I know  
That he loves me much more  
And I'll be here waiting  
Until he comes back to me.  
  
There's one thing  
You should know:  
Just how much I love him so.  
Though he hurt me,  
He won't desert me,  
And now  
He'll come back to me.  
  
Once more, once more,  
Tell me that he's still sure.  
I know, I know  
That he loves me much more  
And I'll be here waiting  
Until he comes back to me.  
  
There's one thing  
You should know:  
Just how much I love him so.  
Though he hurt me,  
He won't desert me,  
And now  
He'll come back to me.  
  
So you see,  
Patiently  
I'll be waiting here for his call.  
Voices singing,  
Church bells ringing  
To say  
He's come back to me.
