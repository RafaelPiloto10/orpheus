It's always one thing or another, seems like we never get ahead  
Reaching out for the brass ring, and landing in the dirt instead  
We can't get past yesterday, we're only counting down from ten  
It seems like every move we make, brings us back where we began  
You've gotta Run Between The Raindrops  
If you want to see the sun  
Run, Run, Run, Between The Raindrops  
Run Between The Raindrops, if you want to see the sun  
Run, Run, Run, - Run Baby Run  
  
Somewhere there's a sun that's shining  
Somewhere we'll find a life that's good  
Some way I'm gonna make it happen  
Just like you always knew I could  
  
We're treading water on a river of tears  
And I don't know what to do  
I can take a beating, but I ain't gonna let it happen to you, you  
  
You've gotta Run Between The Raindrops  
If you want to see the sun  
Run, Run, Run, Between The Raindrops  
Run Between The Raindrops, if you want to see the sun  
You Gotta Run, Run, Run, - Run Baby Run  
  
We're treading water on a river of tears  
And I don't know what to do  
  
You've gotta Run Between The Raindrops  
If you want to see the sun  
Run, Run, Run, Between The Raindrops  
Run Between The Raindrops, if you want to see the sun  
Run, Run, Run, - Run Baby Run  
  
Run Between The Raindrops, if you want to see the sun  
You Gotta Run, Run, Run, - Run Baby Run  
  
You Gotta Run, Run, Run, - Run Baby Run
