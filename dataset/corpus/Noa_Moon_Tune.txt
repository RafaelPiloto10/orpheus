Night-time, night-time,  
The moon is looking  
At our little garden below  
  
The blossoming hyacinth  
In our garden abounds  
Night-time,  
The moon is looking down  
  
And the moon turns to the clouds and says:  
Give a little drop of water to the flower beds!  
So the hyacinth can bloom  
In our garden, 'neath the moon  
Night-time  
The moon is looking down  
  
The drops came down, pattered on my pane,  
Quenched the thirst of all the flowers  
Longing for the rain  
Now the hyacinth can grow  
Lovely flowers it will show,  
Night-time  
The moon is looking down  
  
Good night
