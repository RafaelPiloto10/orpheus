[Intro:]  
No cut  
Pure raw  
We sold out  
You bought more  
[Verse:]  
It was meant to be  
Hip hop died, reincarnated through me  
Now the promoters gotta double my fee  
'Cause these pop melodies ain't fucking with me  
Get back on your tour bus roll some rockly  
Hell your crew twisted in the -ahhh- not me  
Hell through (time) and the game in my speed  
'Cause water down hip hop we do not need  
Yes sir, I got the real recipe  
A little bit of old E and bon bon Z  
I guess by now you can tell you miss me  
The baddest motherfucker in rap history  
One to the temple put you out your misery  
That's not an album, that's a frisbee  
Tangle with ll boy that's risky  
Them boys is backwash, we want whiskey  
[Hook:]  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town  
[Verse 2:]  
Roll up on your set pull out the 4 pound  
Who's pitching out here blast them off the map  
The game got us bored, no rebounce  
Claims he's hardcore how he sound  
My radio's a bunch of noise in the background  
For a factory manufacturing pop clowns  
That's what happens when ll ain't around  
The pop stars flooding and the hip hop drowns  
Dj suffer while sarada goes round  
You screaming? Got the real creaming  
Welcome to hip hop, we're out here fiending  
Watch a program directed in the bin and  
Went from cruss group to a boy band screaming  
When it come under the car I ain't leaning  
I wish I could bump the brim creaming  
I tell you what, play my stupid -- call it even  
[Hook:]  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town  
[Verse 3:]  
What y'all want, no cut!  
What y'all need, pure raw  
What we do, we sold out  
All because... You bought more!  
No affects on my voice, that's my choice  
Hard raw beat make a soft voice moist  
Get the dinero bring the heat like Jon Voight  
Timbaland music, rolls royce  
Hit you in the head like a fat joint  
Back to the S's big meat in Detroit  
L so perceptive shrud in the droit  
Bad motherfucker, now you get the point?  
[Hook:]  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)
