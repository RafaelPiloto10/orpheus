[Big Boi]  
Uh-huh, yeah, y'knahmtalkinbout?

Chorus: repeat 2X (sung)  
  
I know you're waitin for daddy, it won't be long shawty  
Be patient cause I'm comin to you  
Ridin dirty on 85, slow, takin it easy  
I don't want nothin to keep me from you  
  
[J-Bo]  
Now the wind blows as I'm on 85, and chiefin good  
with a six-pack a that Colt 45 just like I should  
And if I could, I will, I might, get blowed tonight  
If thangs go right, I'm gon' cut this hoe tonight  
So I'ma get a call, from this broad  
Run the game like she ain't ready  
But still indeed, she on her knees, keepin thangs steady  
like Betty Crocker, the face doctor  
just as she swallows with passion  
So now she braggin, laggin behind  
What questions she now be askin, so time is passin  
Now I'm mashin on, I'm gone, livin in the world of hoes  
So I suppose, it's goin down deep in yo' city  
Cause in these parts, ain't nuthin bad hard times  
Now shawty, please, really  
  
Chorus  
  
[Big Boi]  
Sheeeit  
I'm lookin for anythang, gonna cut'em up  
like everythang, in my stable  
Sir Lucius, with the left foot, is ready willing and able  
But these hoes will get on your nerves  
Fuck all that kickin 'em to the curb  
You lackin that tolerance
