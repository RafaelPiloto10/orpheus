We carried all the colors,  
From the portrait of our summer.  
We never felt the answers,  
Weighing down our shoulders.  
  
Time goes fast when you wander,  
And nothing lasts forever.  
But I still feel the power,  
Of you and me together,  
And light that surrounds you.  
  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Though I'm always the last to believe.  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Cause I'm here, and you're with me.  
  
So tell me are you willing,  
To try this thing called living.  
'Cause there's so many edges hidden,  
It's so hard to be forgiving.  
  
But I'll try once if you ask me,  
And once again everlasting.  
For all my days I'll love you,  
And all the stars you run through,  
See the light surround you...

I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Though I'm always the last to believe.  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Cause I'm here, and you're with me.  
  
When the wrongs and the rights all've been pushed aside,  
You're my favorite color.  
You're the black to the white and the warmth inside,  
You're the sun I'm under.  
  
I volunteer to watch you,  
Through the dreams that haunt you.  
I promise, to wake you,  
Before the fear takes you.  
  
May the light surround you  
(May the light surround you)  
May the light surround you  
  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Though it took so long to see.  
I know I'm the lucky one,  
'Cause I'm here, and you're with me.  
  
(May the light surround you)
