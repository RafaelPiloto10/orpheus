Let me tell you about this girl I know  
First glance and damn she stole my heart  
She amazes me

Underneath the willow tree  
Kissing, loving, making sweet sexy baby  
The grass is greener on the other side  
There's no other side when it's you and I  
Tonight, let's count the stars

For tonight baby, come lie here next to me

Just another butterfly sigh
