Tele He's Not Talking  
Tele he's the one he knows what to say  
Knows how to find his own way  
He knows the roads by night and by doorways  
But watching the light in a hall  
Won't change a thing or say at all  
What it is that he says  
  
Still he says that I don't know  
Still he says that I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't why I think about so much  
When I don't know what it is I can't say  
And I wouldn't change a thing if I believe you all  
And scream it in your face  
  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
  
Tele deals the cards and draws an ace  
And finds himself miles away  
Where skies ain't bruised by towers and fumes  
Children ain't too young to play  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all  
But we're born different days  
  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
Still I'd say hey I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all when I'm miles away  
Would I change a thing  
I'd change it all but we were born on different days  
  
I'd change a thing  
I'd change it all when I'm miles away...
