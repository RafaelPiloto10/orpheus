We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
When you get, what you need  
It's no way of knowing  
What you get is another hole to feed  
  
Your name was the one that was always chosen  
Your words and the kindness that set me free  
Words can leave you broken inside  
You'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen  
You open my eyes to the world I could believe  
  
This world has left me broken inside  
I'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
Words can leave you broken inside  
You'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here  
  
This world can leave you broken inside  
I'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen  
You open my eyes to the world I could believe
