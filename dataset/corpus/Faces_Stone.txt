(ronnie lane)  
Once I was a stone many years ago  
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.  
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.  
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,  
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan  
Dan the blacksmith.  
Once I was a sword, many years ago.  
And my blade was broad, many years ago.  
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.  
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,  
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,  
Oh my.  
Once I was a daisy, many years ago.  
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.  
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float  
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,  
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.  
Once I was a grub, many years ago.  
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.  
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.  
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.  
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.  
Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.  
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.  
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,  
Said "pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke".  
Once I was a mule, a many years ago.  
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.  
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick  
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,  
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.  
I was born a human baby, many years ago.  
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.  
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be
wild.  
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.  
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.  
I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.  
I've known good times and disaster.  
But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,  
The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster.  
I don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.
