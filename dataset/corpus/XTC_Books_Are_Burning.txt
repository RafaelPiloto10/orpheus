Books are burning  
In the main square, and I saw there  
The first eating the text  
Books are burning  
In the still air  
And you know where they burn books  
People are next  
I believe the printed word should be forgiven  
Doesn't matter what it said  
Wisdom hotline from the dead back to the living  
Key to the larder for your heart and head  
Books are burning  
In our own town, watch us turn 'round  
And cast our glances elsewhere  
Books are burning  
In the playground  
Smell of burnt book is not unlike human hair  
I believe the printed word is more than sacred  
Beyond the gauge of good or bad  
The human right to let your soul fly free and naked  
Above the violence of the fearful and sad  
The church of matches  
Anoints in ignorance with gasoline  
The church of matches  
Grows fat by breathing in the smoke of dreams  
It's quite obscene  
Books are burning  
More each day now, and I pray now  
You boys will tire of these games  
Books are burning  
I hope somehow, this will allow  
A phoenix up from the flames
