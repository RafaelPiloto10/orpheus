Let's share the thrills that were made,  
Especially for the young!  
The dreams that never will fade,  
Especially for the young!  
Let's find out why a tender sigh,  
Is the sweetest song ever sung,  
Especially for the young! (Especially for the young!)  
Especially for the young! (Especially for the young!)  
  
So take my hand,  
And walk with me!  
The night is young,  
And so are we!  
  
Let's lose our hearts in a kiss,  
Especially for the young!  
For nights are made just like this,  
Especially for the young!  
The moon is there for all to share,  
But we will find it was hung,  
Especially for the young!  
Especially for the young! (Especially for the young!)  
  
Especially for the young!
