reality is what you want to see it shouldn't make a difference to me i put my
trust in what you had to say it didn't make a difference anyway i know you've
tried your "very best" and i'm so glad thank you so much disappointment is
what you've made this expectations overrated disappointment is what you've
made this my ambition is so deflated reality is different for me my eyes are
opened wide enough to see i've listened to your explinations why the more you
fail, the harder that i try a case of mistaken opportunity i guess i really
got it wrong identity is insignificant or is it everything?
