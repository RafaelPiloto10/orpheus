Pack up your troubles in your old gym bag  
You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin  
I'll take short breaks, love her to the outbreaks  
  
Standing on the seashore, lookin' at the city  
See the street light, dog bite, go lady on the TD8  
The wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves  
There's others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby  
  
Can't break, cabbage head  
Try and get a salad made  
Hold my pickle, hold the lettuce  
Session waters don't upset us  
  
Kick, stand, face look so evil, like Knieval  
Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner  
Like a squawk eight fool in I don't know orogotus  
If I have to do rock a roller up a jello  
  
Facial, connish lie  
Smoke a bowl of feeling fine  
Burn and people, try to let us  
Session waters won't upset us  
  
Hee lee cans (Kick in the pants)  
Water fall (got on a dance)  
Blame it all (Say gotta eve us a trance)  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it...
