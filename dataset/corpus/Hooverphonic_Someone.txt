And through all Alex's wondrous  
Childhood he would honor and obey  
Love and watch the lovely maiden  
On whose gentle arms he just lay  
All men all must be mild obedient  
All men all must be mild obedient  
As good as he  
  
And through all Alex's wondrous

As good as he  
  
And All men all must be mild obedient
