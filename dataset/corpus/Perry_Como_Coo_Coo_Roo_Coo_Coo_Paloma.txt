Coo coo roo coo coo, paloma  
Tell her that I'm oh so lonely . . .  
Coo coo roo coo coo, paloma  
Tell her that I love her only . . .  
Please, pretty little dove,  
Hurry to my love, tell her this for me . . .  
Since she is far away,  
Every day is sad, blue as it can be . . .  
I couldn't even start,  
Pouring out my heart, to her in a letter . . .  
You, pretty little bird,  
You can sing the words, you can tell her better . . .  
Coo coo roo coo coo, paloma  
Coo coo roo coo coo ( Spanish )  
Coo coo roo coo coo . . .  
Coo coo roo coo coo . . .  
Coo coo roo coo coo . . . paloma . . .
