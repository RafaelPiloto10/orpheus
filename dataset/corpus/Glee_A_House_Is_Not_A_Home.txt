A chair is still a chair  
Even when there's no one sitting there.  
But a chair is not a house  
And a house is not a home  
When there's no one there to hold you tight  
And no one there you can kiss goodnight.  
  
A room is still a room  
Even when there's nothing there but gloom.  
But a room is not a house  
And a house is not a home  
When the two of us are far apart.  
And one of us has a broken heart.  
  
Now and then I call your name  
And suddenly a face appears.  
But it's just a crazy game  
And it ends,  
It ends in tears.  
  
So darling, have a heart.  
Don't let one mistake keep us apart.  
I'm not meant to live alone,  
Turn this house into a home.  
When I climb the stair and turn the key,  
Please be there,  
  
Still in love with me.
