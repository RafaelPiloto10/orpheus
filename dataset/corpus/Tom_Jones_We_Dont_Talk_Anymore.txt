I used to think that life was sweet  
I used to think it was so complete  
I can't believe you, you've thrown it away  
I used to think we had it made  
I used to feel we would sail away  
Can you just imagine how I feel today  
Well, it seems a long time ago  
You were the lonely one  
Now it comes to letting go  
And you're the only one  
Do you know what you've done  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore  
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It really doesn't matter to me  
I guess your leaving was meant to be  
It's down to you now  
You want to be free  
Well, I hope you know which way to go  
You're on your own again  
Don't come running to me when you're the lonely one  
Remember what you've done  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny how we don't talk ..... anymore.......
