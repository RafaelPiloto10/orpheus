Well, I don't wanna be President, Superman, or Clark Kent  
I don't wanna walk around in their shoes  
'Cause I don't know whose side I'm on  
I don't know my right from wrong  
I don't know where I'm goin' to  
I don't know about you  
I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I don't wanna make you mad  
I don't wanna meet your dad  
I don't wanna be your dream come true  
'Cause I don't know just what I've found  
I don't know my sky from ground  
I don't know where I'm goin' toI don't know about you  
I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?  
I can be myself, how 'bout you?
