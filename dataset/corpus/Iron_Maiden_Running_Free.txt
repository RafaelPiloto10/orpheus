Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck  
I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free  
  
Spent the night in an L. A. jail, and listened to the sirens wail  
They ain't got a thing on me, I'm running wild, I'm running free  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free  
  
Puller here at the Bottle Top, whiskey, dancing, disco hop  
Now all the boys are after me, and that's the way it's gonna be  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
