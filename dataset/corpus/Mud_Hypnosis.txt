You laughed with me, I laughed with you  
You said that you already knew  
You looked at me, I looked at you  
And there was nothing I could do  
What to do, after all you put me through  
Ooh ? ooh, ooh, ooh  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar  
You captured me, I fell for you  
Now I've got nothing left to lose  
You walked on me, I let you do  
Whatever you must put me through  
Put me through, now what have I done to you?  
Ooh ? ooh, ooh, ooh  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar  
You're hypnotic when you touch  
Your hypnosis is too much  
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire  
You're hypnotic when you feel  
Your hypnosis is too real  
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar
