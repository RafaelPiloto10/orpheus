Lost  
On a painted sky  
Where the clouds are hung  
For the poet's eye  
You may find him  
If you may find him  
  
There  
On a distant shore  
By the wings of dreams  
Through an open door  
You may know him  
If you may  
  
Be  
As a page that aches for words  
Which speaks on a theme that's timeless  
While the Sun God will make for your day  
Sing  
As a song in search of a voice that is silent  
And the one God will make for your way  
  
And we dance  
To a whispered voice  
Overheard by the sould  
Undertook by the heart  
And you may know it  
If you may know it  
  
While the sand  
Would become the stone  
Which begat the spark  
Turned to living bone  
Holy, holy  
Sanctus, sanctus  
  
Be  
As a page that aches for word  
Which speaks on a theme that is timeless  
While the Sun God will make for your day  
Sing  
As a song in search of a voice that is silent  
And the one God will make for your day
