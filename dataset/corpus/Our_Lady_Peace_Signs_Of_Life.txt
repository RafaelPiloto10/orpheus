I'm not lookin' for trouble. I'm takin' one in the chin.  
I don't know where I'm goin', or where to begin.  
Alone in this room, thinkin' of you nd what could've been.  
  
The trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble got to me.  
And there's no signs of life in here at all.  
The sound of quiet is defining.  
I'll wait for you to call.  
And there's no sings of life in here at all.  
All the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble, won't get the best of me.  
  
Ah la la la la la  
Ah la la la la la  
Ah la la la la la la  
  
I'm sending you out a signal.  
Over land, over sea.  
From the top of the great lakes, down the Mississippi.  
Alone in the room, thinkin' of you and those possibilities.  
  
The trouble that I've seen.  
This trouble got to me.  
And there's no signs of life in here at all.  
The sound of quiet is defining.  
I'll wait for you to call.  
And there's no signs of life in here at all.  
All the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble.  
Ah the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble won't get the best of me.  
  
There's no signs of life in here at all.  
The sound of quiet is defining.  
I'll wait for you to call.  
There's no signs of life in here at all.  
Ah the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble.  
Ah the trouble that I've seen.  
And trouble won't get the best of me.
