Well I wish, I was a catfish  
Swimin' in the, the deep blue sea  
I have all you pretty women  
Fishin' after me  
Showin' up after me  
Oh well  
Ow well  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Well I went down  
To my girlfriends house  
And I sat alone on her front step  
And she said a "come in outcha man and just your love"  
I just now left  
I just now left  
And I say  
Who yeah  
She said sure enough you did  
Who yeah  
Who yeah  
Who yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah,  
Well there's two  
Two trains runnin'  
But there's not a one that's goin' my way  
You know there's a, one train running at midnight  
The other one leave just for day  
Leave just for day  
Oh well  
Yeah  
  
I role and I tumble  
Practically all night long  
I role and I tumble  
Practically all night long  
Well, my baby don't treat me well

Yeah
