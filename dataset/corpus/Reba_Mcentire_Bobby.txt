Bobby pleaded guilty to the charges that they read  
As they led him from the courtroom, a young voice turned his head  
A little boy, dressed in blue, was standing at the rail  
He said "I hope they kill you, I hope you go to hell"  
They locked Bobby in a jail with forty other men  
They all knew what he had done, they were glad to take him in  
They'd all seen the headlines about Bobby and his wife  
How they loved each other, and how he took her life  
Day after day, he sat alone  
Night after night, they'd hear him sing his song (he'd sing)  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down  
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around  
I am not afraid of what people say or do  
The only thing I fear is being here... without you  
  
The little boy dressed up in blue grew up to be a man  
When he fell in love himself, he came to understand  
How it was that Bobby took the life they both adored  
Cause Bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore  
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed  
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears he read  
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind  
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line  
And the one about the man who sits alone  
Year after year, singing his song (he'd sing)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The young man drove his car up, and parked outside the gate  
They led him to a cold gray room, the guard told him to wait  
When the guard brought Bobby in, the young man finally knew  
He still missed his mama, but he'd missed his daddy too  
And when the guard left the two of them alone  
He took Bobby in his arms, and the young man sang the song  
  
Daddy, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down  
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around  
You have taught me not to fear what people say or do  
The only thing I fear is being here... without you
