Weapons of mass distraction are used by politicians and conspiracy theorists  
Within their reach  
The entire solar system withstanding geographical combat  
Annihilation is one source of political free speech  
In a world of nuclear devastation, doom and deteonation  
In a world of curiosity beyond the imagination  
Every man and woman decides to hide the conspiracy behind global armageddon  
When the entire planet prepares for destruction  
Connecting their minds with others through telepathy  
In the common sense of human curiosity  
Destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
People use their super-human powers to discover the dark and dangerous world  
Of hypothetical secrets  
In most cases, sometimes he or she confess why they regret  
In my opinion, gubernatorial fear is far from over  
The conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest self-destructive endeavor  
More and more human beings make connections  
And it's part of an all-out worldwide chain reaction  
Keep staring at the annihilation gun before it's too late  
One year from now, the entire world's about to detonate  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
All nations will self-destruct, according to research scientists  
The bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist  
Search for the enemy within your secret human desire  
Stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire  
Stare at the anti-terrorsts standing higher  
Look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand  
Nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand  
Find one or more anti-terrorism activist fighting for freedom  
Be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere
