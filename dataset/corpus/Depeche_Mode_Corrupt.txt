I could corrupt you  
In a heart beat  
You think your so special  
Think your so sweet  
What are you trying don't even tempt me  
Soon you'll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be  
You'll be calling out my name  
When you need someone to blame  
  
I can corrupt you  
It would be easy  
Watching you suffer  
God, it would please me  
  
I wanna touch you with my little finger  
I know it will crush you my memory would linger  
You'd be crying out in pain  
Begging me to play my games  
  
I can corrupt you  
It will be ugly  
They could sedate you  
But what good would drugs be  
I wanna touch you with my hands on your hips  
It would be too much to  
Place my lips on your lips  
You'll be calling out my name  
Begging me to play my games
