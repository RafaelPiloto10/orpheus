When you give what's in your heart, to the one you love  
You want them to give their love back to you  
When every kiss and every smile mean the world to you  
Then you've got it bad  
Don't need a cure for what you're going through  
This feelin' inside you can't let it hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin', never stop that feelin'  
When your love is true  
Feelin', never stop that feelin'  
There ain't nothin' you can do now  
Feelin', never gonna stop that feelin'  
You feel it through and through, honey  
Feelin', never gonna stop that feelin'  
Cause there ain't nothin' you can do now, boy  
  
When every look and every touch makes you come undone  
And you can't believe this feelin' is real  
When the sound of someone's name gives you butterflies  
Don't wonder why 'cause you can be sure  
That you're in love  
This feelin' inside you can't let it hide  
  
[Chorus: x2]
