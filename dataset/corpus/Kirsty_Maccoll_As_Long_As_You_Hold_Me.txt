As long as you hold me I'll get by  
As long as you need me I will try not to die  
I don't want the shame  
I don't want the blame  
I don't want the fame anymore  
  
If only they'd tell me, tell me why  
If I could believe them and their lies  
But I don't want their name  
I don't want their pain  
I won't play their games anymore  
  
I always look at the last page of the book  
How will it end?  
The suspense robs me of lovers and friends  
  
I don't want the shame  
I don't want the blame  
I don't want the fame anymore
