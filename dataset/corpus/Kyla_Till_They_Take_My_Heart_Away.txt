I look into your eyes, so far away  
There's trouble in your mind  
You're losing faith  
Hey now, let me hold you  
It'll be okay!  
Coz I will love you  
Till they take my heart away.  
Remember when you called  
And said goodbye  
We thought we'd lost it all  
And so did I  
Even if I lost you  
I would feel the same  
Coz I will love you  
Till they take my heart away.  
Believe in me  
I'm here to stay  
I will love you  
Till they take my heart away.  
Now we're stronger than before  
We've made it throught  
I never felt more sure  
Because of you  
Hey now! are you listening?  
Do you hear me say  
"I will love you  
Till they take my heart away"
