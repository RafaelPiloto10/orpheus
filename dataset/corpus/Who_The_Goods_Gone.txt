I know when I've had enough  
When I think your love is rough  
  
[Chorus:]  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
The good's gone out of our love  
I know it's wrong  
We should enjoy it, but  
The good's gone  
The good's gone  
  
Once we used to get along  
Now, each time we kiss, it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it ain't no fun  
And the good's gone now  
We used to love as one  
But we have forgotten now  
  
I know when I've had enough  
When I think your love is rough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gone forever
