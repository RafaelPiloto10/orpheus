Maine on fire, my empire be higher  
Than an octave on Mariah,  
You niggas should worship sire  
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire  
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer  
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars  
I was David promising the world that ima serve Goliath  
Then I swam with sharks,  
Made it to the land and part  
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires  
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo  
Get my head out the window  
20 k in my pocket as I'm feeling the wind blow  
And I ain't have a wallet since nintendo, comprendo  
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo  
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough  
Till I snap back like hov hat  
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that  
  
Maine on fire  
Top down bitch I ain't no liar  
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch  
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher  
Maine on fire  
Every week can see my name on flyers  
Henny by the shots many bottles pop  
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar  
  
We collect a hundred thou  
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now  
I was such a cunning child  
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you  
The one your mama glad you hung around  
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga  
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor nigga  
But it's just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest  
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is  
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas  
We just let the paper blind us  
While vaginas chase behind us  
Take notes make money don't make jokes  
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats  
Real shit but if the world really bout to end  
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen  
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen  
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again  
  
Maine on fire  
Top down bitch I ain't no liar  
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch  
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher  
Maine on fire  
Every week can see my name on flyers  
Henny by the shots many bottles pop  
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar
