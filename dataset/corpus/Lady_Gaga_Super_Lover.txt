Oh oh oh your super lover  
  
Black pants and designer blue  
With my tattoos of 'i love you'  
I juts put on these dancing shoes  
To prove, my love, for you

Secretly he notices, I'm...  
Playing it up!  
For him, I'm playing it up  
I'm living it up  
Dancing on the tables, as the dj's  
Spinning it up, for me  
Spinning it up, for me!  
  
When the sun goes down, and the care ends up  
It's time for the show-oh oh ohh  
Plating you to the scene,  
Make fake for the queen  
I'm on a role oh oh ohh  
  
Staring my direction  
Craving your attention  
So now go back to the beat,  
Get up on your feet  
Gonna be your super lover!  
Right back to the beat,  
Get up on your feet

Champaigne in the glasses,  
Flip the bottle baby cmon take your turn
