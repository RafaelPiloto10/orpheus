La,  
I'm gonna buy myself (buy myself)  
a house without windows (windows)  
So I won't see you walking by (walking by)  
And you'll never see me cry  
For all the loving I had you treat me so bad and run away  
So when you look inside (look inside)  
You will never see me cry and cry  
In my house without love  
  
I'm gonna build myself (build myself)  
a house without windows (windows)  
So I can hide the pan (hide the pain)  
And you'll never see me cry again  
So when you're passing my way  
Each time of the day ,you'll feel the love in you  
And you can't look inside  
So you'll never see my cry and cry  
In my house without you  
  
For all the loving I had , you treat me so bad and run away  
So when you look inside ( look inside)  
You will never see me cry and cry in my house without love
