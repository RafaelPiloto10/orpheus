Hey God I just lost a dear old friend  
Hey God I hope he's in your angel band  
Hey God you know he believed in you  
Just help me understand why you do the things you do  
  
Hey God send me down some comfort please  
Hey God I'll be down here on my knees  
Hey God will we ever comprehend  
The forgiveness and grace that lies waiting in the end  
  
Oh there's anger and tears  
For all of the years that your children won't have you to hold  
Oh my heart had been broken  
The angels have spoken still I wish I could watch you grow old  
  
Hey God I know he didn't die alone  
Hey God tell my old friend welcome home  
Hey God please hear me when I pray  
Pray for a little peace 'til we meet again someday  
Pray for a little peace 'til we meet again someday
