Pass the time kickin' as time rips by  
Neither goose nor the gander fly  
Buy a minute spend an hour burnin' burnin'  
Take a peek as the model earns it earns it  
Walk a mile as it keeps crawlin' crawlin'  
Clean the politician, wash with everpure  
  
So the answer gets harder  
A nd the truth's getting farther and farther  
And the bottle keeps churnin'  
Seven caged tigers fly by  
  
Wastin' time chasing those cows that fly  
Churnin' out all that butterfly sugarboost  
Track the blade as it swoops downward and onward  
Take a pill it'll kill martyrs, martyrs  
  
Passin' time rippin' as time kicks by  
Pass the umbilical cord down for this flyby  
Take a sneak while the model earns it, earns it  
Hike a mile as it keeps crawlin'  
  
So the answer gets harder  
And the truth's getting farther and farther  
And the bottle keeps churnin'  
Seven caged tigers fly by
