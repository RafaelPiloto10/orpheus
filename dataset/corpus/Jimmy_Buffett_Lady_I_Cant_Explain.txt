Jimmy Buffett  
What could I do?  
That's never been done before  
What can I say?  
That hasn't been said by scores  
  
If I was a designer I could do nothing finer  
Than dress you in style  
But I'm a hopeless romantic still  
Behind all these antics  
Is a heart full of smiles  
  
So I'll just keep on dreamin'  
The thoughts that are in my brain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I can't explain  
  
I know that I've  
The imagination of a child  
And there are times  
When I let it all run wild  
  
But if I hurt, you forgive  
Still you won't let me live  
Some of those episodes down  
  
That's why I love you  
And put no one above you  
Love your sights and your sounds  
  
So I'll just keep on movin'  
When the forecast calls for rain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I can't explain  
  
So I'll just keep on movin'  
When the forecast calls for rain  
You just keep on being  
The lady I can't explain  
Yes I love you  
Put no one above you  
You're the lady I can't explain
