Blue jeans  
White shirt  
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn  
It was like, James Dean, for sure  
Your so fresh to death and sick as ca-ca-cancer  
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on air pop  
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know  
That love is mean, and love hurts  
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
Big dreams  
Gangster  
Said you had to leave to start your life over  
I was like "no please", stay here  
We don't need no money we can make it all work  
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday  
I stayed up waitin, anticipatin' and pacin', but he was  
Chasin' paper  
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
You went out every night  
An' baby that's all right  
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side  
Cause I'm a ride or die  
Whether you fail or fly  
Well shit at least you tried  
But when you walked out that door  
A piece of me died  
Told you I wanted more  
That's not what I had in mind  
Just want it like before  
We were dancin' all night  
Then they took you away  
Stole you out of my life  
You just need to remember  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time
