I know that I'm out of my mind  
Yeah I know when two hearts collide  
It can be such a suffering thing  
I was there before now I'm here again  
I'm a sucker for love  
La la la la la la la  
I walk right into temptation  
And I can't get enough  
La la la la la la la  
I'm addicted to the sensation  
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it  
And I'll arrange the stars around (oh oh oh)  
Tell me true, tell me nice, tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight (oh oh oh)  
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment  
This house of ours is made of fire (Oh oh oh)  
  
And I'll arrange a spell of desire.  
I know that I'm helpless and crazy  
I thaw and I cannot explain why I do  
It's like a lock and a key  
You open the door and I'm running free  
I'm a sucker for love  
La la la la la la la  
I walk right into temptation  
And I can't get enough  
  
La la la la la la la  
I'm addicted to the sensation  
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it  
And I'll arrange the stars around (oh oh oh)  
Tell me true, tell me nice, tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight (oh oh oh)  
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment  
This house of ours is made of fire (Oh oh oh)  
  
And I'll arrange a spell of desire.  
Oh, oh  
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it  
And I'll arrange the stars around (oh oh oh)  
Tell me true, tell me nice, tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight (oh oh oh)  
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment  
This house of ours is made of fire (Oh oh oh)  
  
And I'll arrange a spell of desire.  
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it  
And I'll arrange the stars around (oh oh oh)  
Tell me true, tell me nice, tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight (oh oh oh)  
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment
