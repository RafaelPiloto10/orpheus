(Dolly Parton)  
I would spin for you a blanket  
Out of gold and silver threads  
I would let my gentle bosom  
Be a pillow for your head  
I'd caress your perfect body  
On a rosy bed at night  
Play you love songs on a golden harp  
And sing you Butterflies  
In a diamond-studded chalice  
On an emerald-plated tray  
I would bring to you sweet nectar  
And gifts of bright array  
I would paint for you a castle  
In a blue and yellow sky  
Paint you happy ever after  
And paint you Butterflies  
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion  
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion  
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies  
I get close to you and I get butterflies  
If only I were magic  
I would make the wishes true  
I would wave a magic wand  
And be in Paradise with you  
But I'm just a girl that loves you  
I will love you all my life  
But I do have a magic feeling  
And it gives me butterflies  
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion  
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion  
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies  
We should fly away together, you and I  
Off to paradise forever, I get high  
I get close to you and I get butterflies  
I think of you and I get butterflies  
I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads  
If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true  
I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you
