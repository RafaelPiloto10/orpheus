Daily  
I've been waiting  
For the time to pass  
And Let it fade in  
But baby, my patience  
Is driving me crazy  
Making me fall apart  
What do you do  
When the truth isn't  
Quite enough?  
They lookin at you  
Tellin you  
We need to break it up  
You need to trust what you do  
It's you and me my love  
But Ima make it up to you  
And show the world  
I'm a changed man  
Cause you mean much to me  
I don't wanna be done  
I'm doing all that I can  
And everybody hates Chris  
They can never understand  
So can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love again  
Girl I know I told you  
Baby this ain't over  
This ain't over  
It ain't over  
I remember your touch  
God I miss you so much  
Please believe me  
Baby I'm sorry  
And all of this money and fame  
Can never amount  
To every morning when I see your face  
What do you do?  
When the truth isn't  
Quite enough?  
They looking at you  
Tellin you  
We need to break it up  
You need to trust what you do  
It's you and me my love  
But Ima make it up to you  
And show the world  
I'm a changed man  
Cause you mean much to me  
I don't wanna be done  
I'm doing all that I can  
And everybody hates Chris  
They can never understand  
So can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love again again  
Girl I know I told you  
Baby this ain't over  
This ain't over  
It ain't over  
Saying I'm sorry  
Doesn't make it alright  
I know  
I know  
But I believe that we can make it  
If we try  
If we try  
Yeah, yeah  
Wooaaaah  
I'm a changed man  
Cause you mean much to me  
And I don't wanna be done  
I'm doing all that I can  
And everybody hates Chris  
They can never understand  
So can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love again  
Girl I know I told you  
Baby this ain't over  
This ain't over  
It ain't over  
It ain't over  
Ohhhhhh...  
It ain't over.
