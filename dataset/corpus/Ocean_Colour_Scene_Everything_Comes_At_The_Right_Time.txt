I got a better love, got a whole new prose  
Got a whole new goal  
And I gonna find love, I'm gonna fall in love  
And it makes me cold  
And I gotta move my heels, gotta move outta here  
Gotta change my lane  
And I, I commend you now, yes, I told you soon  
So that you'd know now  
  
That at times, everything comes at the right time  
And at times, everything comes at the right time  
  
I, never understand, never understand  
With this pain in my hand  
And I cut my home, yes I cut my home  
When I need to go  
And I know your face, know it aches  
And I know it's sad  
Oh I, quit that scene 'cos I could not see  
Just where to be  
  
'Cos at times, everything comes at the right time  
And at times, everything comes at the right time  
  
Yes I got a better love, got a big part of love  
And it makes me whole  
Oh I yes I play with love, yes I play with love  
And it's playing with me  
  
But at times, everything comes at the right time  
And at times, everything comes at the right time  
And at times, everything comes at the right time  
  
Come on over to my side now  
Come on over to my side now  
Come on over to my side now
