Yes, I know I'm late gettin' home tonight  
Can supper wait, I quess I lost my appetite  
Yeah you can fix me a drink, oh anything's okay  
Oh, by the way I met a friend of yours today  
  
I was workin' on the other side of town  
And comin' home I thought I'd stop and have a round  
And in this bar I heard someone speak your name  
And that's how I met a friend of yours today  
  
I listened for awhile and I could tell  
That that stranger there he knew you much to well  
And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face  
Oh what a shame I met a friend of yours today  
  
Please don't cry woman 'cause it's much too late for tears  
Yeah, I'm sorry too 'cause it hurts after all these years  
  
And ain't it sad a love like ours should end this way  
And all because I met a friend of yours today
