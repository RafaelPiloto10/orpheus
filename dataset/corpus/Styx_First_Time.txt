The lights are low  
And we're alone  
The fire's glow  
It keeps us warm  
As I reach out and touch your face  
The moon lights up our first embrace  
But please don't hesitate  
Hold my hand, don't be afraid  
Of the feelings in your heart  
Just close your eyes, no one will mind  
If we're to fall in love this first time  
  
Don't be afraid of love  
Don't be afraid of love  
Don't be afraid of love  
  
It's the first time  
The first time for love  
There could be so many worlds and mountains  
We could climb  
Together, the two of us tonight  
  
The two of us, we're quite a pair  
These lonely nights we both can share  
So don't be shy, 'cause it's okay  
I understand feeling that way  
Hold my hand, don't be afraid  
Of the feelings in your heart  
Close your eyes, no one will mind  
If we're to fall in love this first time  
It's the first time  
The first time for love  
There could be so many worlds and mountains  
We could climb  
Together, the two of us tonight
