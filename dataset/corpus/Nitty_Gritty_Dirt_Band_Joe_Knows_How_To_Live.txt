Blue Monday morning at the factory gate  
Almost time to clock in  
The boys were bettin'  
That Joe wouldn't show  
Cause they had seen him over the weekend  
He had four new tire on his old cadillac  
Betty the waitress and some clothes in the back  
A dashboard full of roadmaps of Mexico  
Yeah, Joe knows how to live  
  
He said, "Women were made to love,  
Money is made to spend,  
Life is something, buddy,  
You will never live again"  
Yeah, you've got to admit it  
Joe's knows how to live  
  
And now they'll be down at the ocean  
He and Betty stretched out somewhere  
The only blue in his life  
Is the blue moonlight  
Bouncin' off Betty's blonde hair  
I can just see 'em rollin' round on the sand  
I never thought I was a jealous man  
But when I think what he's doin' that I'm not, hah  
Lord I'm jealous about it  
  
He said, "Women were made to love,  
Money is made to spend,  
Life is something, buddy,  
You will never live again"  
Yeah, you've got to admit it  
Joe's knows how to live  
  
Let's go to Mexico!  
Now Betty's back home with her mother  
Joe's back on the assembly line  
But he brings in his pictures  
And his Mexican hat  
Just to remind us sometime  
That women were made to love,  
Money is made to spend,  
Life is something, buddy,  
You will never live again  
  
Yeah, you've got to admit it  
Joe's knows how to live  
Yeah, you've got to admit it  
Joe's knows how to live  
That boy's a genius  
He sure is crazy  
Oooo la la la la la la...
