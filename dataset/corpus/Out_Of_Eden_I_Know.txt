Now you've been gone in these streets for like, three weeks now  
I'm startin to worry myself, so come on back now  
Don't want you dealing with a life like me  
Don't want you strung out, don't want to be like me  
Only fourteen and you've been with one child now  
Pregnant with no shoes is where you'll end up now  
You're fourteen, you've got your whole life ahead of you  
What's that twenty year old man got to do with you  
  
I wish-I made a better life for you  
I wish-there was someone you could look up to  
I wish-you did what I say not what I do  
I wish-you'd see the future but I know you  
  
Chorus  
I know-that you want to be in these streets  
I know-you think you gotta hustle to eat  
I know-money doesn't matter to me  
I just want you home  
I know-that you've got to do what you do  
I know-what's that life really doin for you  
I know-that's no way to live your life  
I need you to survive  
  
Little shorty and you want to be a baller now  
Want to ride on twenty-fours like a big timer now  
The respect of your crew that's around you  
On your way to getting kicked out your high school  
Thinking drugs will get you where you need to be  
You might get there but only temporarily  
Before you get there you might be under about 6 feet  
Or behind bars at least five fifty deep  
  
I wish-your daddy was here to help raise you  
I wish-you could see that that life ain't gon' save you  
I wish-you could meet God and He could change you  
I wish-get in your head and rearrange  
I wish-there was someone you could look up to  
I wish-you could see there's another way to get through  
I wish-use your mind and that can't stop you  
I wish-see the future but I know you  
  
Chorus  
  
God has got to hear me  
(hear me when I pray)  
It's heavy on my shoulders  
(make it go away)  
Carrying my babies  
Praying for my brothers  
Carrying for my sisters, my fathers, my mothers  
Hoping that one day soon you'll see  
All you're meant to be  
Come to know the things that are true  
And live the life that's meant for you  
  
Chorus
