Sorry, but I don't understand  
The things you say they make no sense at all  
Funny but I think that you mean them all  
This time don't you  
  
I know that you think I'm a fool  
But couldn't you try to forgive a fool  
One more time  
  
Sorry but I'm not really listening  
I've got my mind on something else if I'm here  
If I'm here at all  
I know that you want me to go don't you  
But it's not as easy as it seems  
I know that you think I'm not here at all  
But I'm just as fed up as you  
  
I know that you want me to leave  
I'm amazed at how cold you can be  
Well may my weak and insipid soul grow stronger in your absence
