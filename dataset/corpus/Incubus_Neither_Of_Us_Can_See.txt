I am one big walking chemical reaction  
A buzzing hive of self synopsis and nascent self perception  
  
Isn't it disdainful and curious  
That both of us think we know everything  
  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
One in the same  
Two of a kind  
And neither of us can see  
  
I am just a blinking neon roadside attraction  
I sow future wrinkles and I'm told I'm tapped potential  
  
Isn't it disdainful and curious  
That both of us think we know everything  
  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
One in the same  
Two of a kind  
And neither of us can see  
  
I am one big fleeting errant contradiction  
So good to meet you we are one in the same  
  
Isn't it disdainful and curious  
That both of us think we know everything  
  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
We both have pains  
We both have eyes  
(Neither of us can see)  
One in the same  
Two of a kind  
And neither of us can see
