I'm sleeping my way out of this one  
With anyone who will lie down  
I'll be stuck fixated on one star  
When the world is crashing down  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
But you've got me looking in through blinds  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well on my own  
  
The only thing worse that not knowing  
Is you think that I don't know  
I'm having another episode  
I just need a stronger dose  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
But you've got me looking in through blinds  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well on my own

Do do do do do do  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
But you got me looking in through blinds  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
I'm trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do to well on my own
