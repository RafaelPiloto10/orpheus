Here I lay, so close to you  
Knowing that you'll see me through  
Another night when we'll feel the joy  
The joy that makes me smile more and more  
  
And every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
And every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
Nah, ohh, oh, babe  
  
It seems that time moves much too fast  
Love is here and love will last  
Your body's warm and sure to please  
Lady of love, take all of me  
  
Every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
Every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
No, ooh  
  
Every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
Every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
Oh, ooh, aah  
  
And through the night, the touch of love will be  
Forever strong and forever sweet  
And giving in to passion's flow  
Creates a world we want to grow  
  
Every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
Every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
  
Every day, hey hey, ooh, every night  
Every day, hey, hey, whoa, every, every night  
Every day, hey, hey  
Naa, ooh, every, every night  
  
Every day I dream, oh I dream  
Naa, ooh each and every night  
You're moving me, soothing me, girl  
Loving, touching, feeling, ohh  
And I'm feeling good, ohh feels good
