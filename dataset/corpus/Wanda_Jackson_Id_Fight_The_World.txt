I don't care what anybody thinks of me  
My pride is gone and here I am on bended knees  
I want you and I need you that's all I know  
And I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go  
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow I'd turn my back on everyone I know  
I'd do these things with no fear of tomorrow  
I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go  
[ vibes ]  
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow...
