You walk into the room, everybody stares  
The talking stops, there's a silence there  
The room is yours, you own it now  
You're in control and everybody down here knows  
You got a place in my heart, I don't want you there  
But you come and you go, like a millionaire  
You take a walk right across my soul  
You're in control and everybody down here knows  
  
You're the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
You're the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show  
  
You love me bad, you love me good  
You're unimpressed, that's understood  
I lost it all, you knew I would  
You're in control and everybody down here knows  
  
You're the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
You're the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show  
  
It's just one night  
It's just one time  
It's just one hotel room  
It's just another dream  
That can't come true  
  
You're the life and the death of the party  
You got my heart right by the throat  
You're the life and the death of the party  
When the stage lights rise  
You start and stop the show
