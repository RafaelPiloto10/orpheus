I was with you when you wrote it, and I liked it better then. back when I
thought you were mine, and sang all your songs for me.  
I liked this song when you were mine, and I liked it better then.  
The people in here, they don't know that tonight I'm one of them.  
Here's to you, and your voice on the juke box!  
Here's to you! I  
I'm dancin' at the love shack.  
Shakin' it down at the love shack.  
Payin' for being a fool like that.  
At this run down place they call the love shack.  
Now the damn country loves you.  
Your voice belongs to them.  
They bought it for a quarter, and they sing along for a beer.  
So just one more boys, whaddya say?  
One more if you please...and I might find a reason why you don't belong to me.  
You can sing your song, boy, cause you sing it good.  
Raise your glass to me, when you're out on the road.  
Cause tonight I paid my quarter, and that still makes you mine.  
Once I said that, but now I'm shakin' at the love shack.  
Here's to you, and your voice on the juke box!  
Here's to you!  
I'm dancin' at the love shack.  
Shakin' it down at the love shack.  
Payin' for being a fool like that.  
At this run down place they call the love shack.
