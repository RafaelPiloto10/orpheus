[Z-Ro]  
It's like tears doesn't matter to you, it's like you laughed at my pain  
Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game  
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer  
Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer  
See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return  
Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn  
Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark  
Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks  
Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence  
But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent  
I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me  
But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me  
I represented for the both of us, how could you love me  
And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus  
Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead  
Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
This is where they all fall down  
Putting burners to they brain, till it bang  
There's no way for the real, to maintain  
This is where they all fall down  
Pay your dues, cause you owe  
When it's your time, God'll give you the go  
  
[Den Den]  
I sit back and put my thoughts, on paper and rhymes  
Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life  
All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail  
Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail  
Cut your tail, while you fall down homie  
Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me  
Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on  
I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on  
Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block  
Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops  
Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone  
95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong  
Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife  
Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life  
Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain  
Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain  
  
[Chorus - 2x]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of  
robbery  
Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain  
Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life  
If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life  
My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong  
And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone  
See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block  
My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block  
I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live  
Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive  
Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round  
But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down  
Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now  
I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now  
So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep  
The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot  
  
[Chorus - 2x]
