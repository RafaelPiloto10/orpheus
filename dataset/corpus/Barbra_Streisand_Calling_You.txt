(Robert Telson)  
  
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Some place better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixing  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
I am calling you  
(Don't you hear me)  
I am calling you  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and I can't sleep  
But we both know a change is coming  
Coming closer, a sweet release  
I am calling you  
(I know you hear me?)  
I am calling you  
I'm gonna walk through the desert to find you  
Gone leave behind the only life I know  
There's a place for hearts that need fixing  
A little cafe with a magic show  
I am calling you  
(Can't you hear me?)  
I am calling you  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
That coffee machine still needs fixing
