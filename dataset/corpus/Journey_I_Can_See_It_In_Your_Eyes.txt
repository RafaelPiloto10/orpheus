Baby... too bad... I used to love you girl  
I... don't care... no more about your face  
No you... make me mad... the way you cat around  
With your lips, your legs  
And all your sexy ways  
Do you got another lover now  
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now  
No... no  
(Chorus)  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
Ever since you walked away  
Said your last goodbye  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
All the damage has been done  
No more alibis  
Oh you... never hear  
A single word I say  
No you... turn away  
Where do you disappear  
Oh I've had enough  
You need to get a life  
It's all... so tired  
I think I'm out of here  
Do you got another lover now  
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now  
No.  
And when you're alone remember why  
You had never learned how to cry.  
No... no  
(Chorus)  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
Ever since you walked away  
Said your last goodbye  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
All the damage has been done  
No more alibis  
(Vintage neal solo)  
Say you got another lover now  
Tell me who you think you're foolin' now  
(Chorus)  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
Ever since you walked away  
Said your last goodbye  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
All the damage has been done  
No more alibis  
Oh...  
Oh...  
(Neal solo reprise to exit)  
I'm awesome
