Amazi-ing Grace, how-ow sweet the-e sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I-I was blind, but now, I see  
  
T'was Grace that taught my-why heart to fear  
And Grace, my fears re-e-elieved  
How precious did tha-at Grace appear  
Oh-oh the hour I first be-elieved  
  
When we've, when we've been there  
Lord, ten thou-ousand year-ears  
Bright shining, bright shining as the su-un  
We've no le-ess days to sing Go-od's praise  
Then when, we first be-egun  
  
We've no less days to sing Go-od's praise  
Then when we first begun
