Since I met you baby my whole life has changed  
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed  
And everybody tells me that I am not the same  
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to I don't need nobody to tell my
troubles to  
'Cause since I met you baby all I need is you  
  
[Choir ]  
  
Since I met you baby and you're my man since I met you baby and you're my man  
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can
