[Biggie mom]  
Lets say many times as i looked and soroow reflexes of my son (Biggie) i argue
sometimes and saltied i soroow thoughts and said "Well Done" i thoght of  
Him (Biggie) instinly and slighty ask why i tried formly and just can't say
goodbye i live with visions twin and twisted passion so cold and withored  
Thoghts batored shattered i dream dreams cherish memory's house friendships
and promise that mattered in the end time is trausured like love for my son  
Love Is Everlasting
