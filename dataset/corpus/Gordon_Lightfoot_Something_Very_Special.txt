She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary  
  
She could be straight-laced or homespun  
Or free and easy on the run  
She could be meek and mild or full of fun  
  
She liked country lanes and aeroplanes  
And cigarettes would make her strange  
And when she wanted you she made it plain  
  
She would never say where she came from  
It didn't seem that she had anyone  
To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay  
  
She departed in the early spring  
She didn't leave me anything  
To follow or to find her  
  
She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary
