Loose Lucy is my delight  
She comes running and we ball all night  
Round and round and round and round  
Don't take much to get me on the ground  
She's my yo-yo, I'm her string  
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing  
  
[Chorus]  
Singing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Singing thank you, for a real good time  
  
I got jumped coming home last night  
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights  
Round and round and round and round  
Don't take much to get me on the ground  
Loose Lucy, she was sore  
Says I know you can't want my love no more,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bebop baby, how can this be  
I know you've been out a cheating on me  
Round and round and round and round  
Don't take much to get the word around  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
I was just hanging out with the other guys  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Went back home with two black eyes  
You know I'll love her till the day I die  
Round and round and round and round  
Don't take much to get the word around  
I like your smile but I ain't your type  
Don't shake the tree when the fruit ain't ripe  
  
[Chorus]
