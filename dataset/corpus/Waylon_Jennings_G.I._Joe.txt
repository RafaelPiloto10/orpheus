Well he smoked those Camel cigarettes about three packs a day  
Nicotine stains on his fingers when he'd stretch them out to play  
That old "Midnight special" is one he loved to do  
Then he'd sing "I'm walking the floor over you  
  
TV preachers and welfare checks for him just had no place  
But he'd take his time to tune real good when he sang  
"Amazing Grace" He'd say boys I'm old and crazy but I still give a damn  
And I still think the boys got screwed over in Vietnam  
  
He'd drag out that old uniform  
And say "they used to call me slim"  
He never could get it buttoned up  
But the pride looked good on him  
He still feels the way he felt  
Over forty years ago  
Here's to the old man  
Here's to G.I. Joe  
  
He only sang the old songs, he's standing still in time  
"My Phillipino baby", right there on his mind  
Then he'd talk about the big one, the war we didn't lose  
He'd pick a little bit like Travis "Re-Enlistment blues"  
  
Here's to my old man  
And all the G.I. Joe's
