Everytime I think of you  
I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue  
Its no problem of mine but its a problem I find  
Living a life that I can't leave behind  
There's no sense in telling me  
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free  
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows  
And everyday my confusion grows  
Everytime I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
I'm waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I can't say  
I feel fine and I feel good  
I feel like I never should  
Whenever I get this way  
I just don't know what to say  
Why can't be be ourselves like we were yesterday  
I'm not sure what this could mean  
I don't think your what you seem  
I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else  
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be  
Everytime I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
I'm waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I can't say  
Everytime I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
I'm waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I can't say
