This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more  
Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  
Damn, here we go again, I just came back, girl, don't make me go again  
She say you been in the streets, you was with that hoe again  
Money wrapped in rubber bands, what you sellin' blow again  
How she got you holdin' guns but you call that hoe your friend  
You ain't posed to bring her home, what do you show her in?  
I was like show her in, never that, oh no  
Anybody in the streets know that that's a no, no  
So know I would never ever  
(Ever, ever)  
Baby, I'm a g, yeah, that's right the seventh letter  
See one thing about the streets, I know where the heffer at  
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at  
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper  
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper  
My ears to the streets, what you gonna tell us?  
You keep talkin' down, girl, you sound like you jealous  
This is the last time, I know I'm bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more  
Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  
Hi honey, I'm home  
She looked at me and said it's five somethin' in the morn  
You smell like you been drinkin', the vibe from me this strong  
I said, baby, that's cologne, she said, nigga, that's patron  
If you wanna keep with them bad habits that's fine  
You think I'm with it then you out your rabid ass mind  
They'll say tricks are for kids, most chicks woulda slid  
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did  
I'll be damned if I do another six with some kids  
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge  
Them niggas that you think are inna mix with ya shit  
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin' biz  
I say hold up, I met you, I was thuggin' back then  
And you was ridin' with me holdin' on a Mack 10  
But that was back when, you ain't give a what  
Now you standin' here tellin' me to give her up  
This is the last time, I know I'm bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more, try to walk  
But I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  
Hold on, baby please, you can't leave now, no, John baby, please  
We gonna get you to a hospital as quickly as possible  
Life is full of obstacles, we gonna get you through this one  
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done  
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one  
Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends  
Late night phone call from one of my close friends  
Tellin' you that we are rushin' to the er  
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in dr  
Me blowin' a cigar, you sippin' a tini  
I told her pack her bags and don't forget her bikini  
Then just like houdini, it all disappeared  
The escape to paradise, didn't end like this I swear  
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could  
If I can't be in the streets I guess heavens just as good  
This is the last time, I know I'm bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more, try to walk  
But I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go
