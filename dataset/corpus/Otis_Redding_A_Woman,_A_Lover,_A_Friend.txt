Mmm, I want me somebody to hold my hand  
Somebody to love me and understand  
I want me a woman, I want a lover, I want a friend, oh  
  
I want me somebody to share my love  
Lovin' is something I gotta have  
I want me a woman, I want a lover, I want a friend  
  
I don't want a fancy gal, powder and paint  
And I don't want me a woman who thinks she's a saint  
I'm lookin' for someone who's not make believe  
And doesn't mind giving so that she may receive  
  
I want me somebody somewhere around  
That's looking for someone  
TEE pound for pound  
  
Oh, I want me a woman, I want a lover, I want a friend

I Want to run away now  
Want her really how now
