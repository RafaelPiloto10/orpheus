Seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon  
Black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes  
Seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon  
Black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes  
  
People, people  
What are we doing here  
Oh, people  
What have we done with things  
People, people  
What are we doing here  
Oh, people  
What have we done with things  
  
When we fight over the oceans?  
When we fight over the skies, and why?  
When we fight over our borders?  
Then we, our brothers and sisters deny  
  
Tell me why is it so cold in here  
  
Seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon  
Black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes  
When we stand in the mother's arms, no feeling of emptiness  
When we stand in the mother's hands, we can see that  
When we fight over the oceans  
When we fight over the skies, and why  
When we fight over our borders  
Then we, our brothers and sisters deny  
  
Tell me why do we do it  
Why do we do it? Oh, .. .
