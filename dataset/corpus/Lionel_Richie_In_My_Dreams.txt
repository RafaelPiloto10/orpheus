My love how I often think of you  
Endless always is my love for you  
Just the thought of you calling my name  
And I'm on my way  
  
So many days I sit and think back  
Of all the things I take back  
If I had a wish it would be that  
I'd be there with you  
  
I think of you everyday, I see your love so far away  
And then you turn and hear me say  
That I will love you always  
  
In my dreams, in my dreams,  
You must be a fantasy  
'Cause you're always in my dreams  
  
My love I know you're the one for me  
Inside your heart is where I want to be  
I know some time has passed us by  
And I'm still here and I still care  
  
All that I dream of I wanna share with you  
There's no life if I'm not living it with you  
You might be far away,  
But in my heart you'll always stay  
Getting closer everyday  
  
In my dreams, in my dreams, you must be a fantasy  
'Cause you're always in my dreams  
  
Once there was magic in the air,  
And once you were all I ever cared about  
But now we know love won't let go  
It's always been there, always in my dreams  
  
In my dreams, in my dreams, you must be a fantasy  
'Cause you're always in my dreams,  
Always in my dreams
