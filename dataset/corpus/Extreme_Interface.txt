Don't just sit there and stare at me,  
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
I'm tired of what we are,  
I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
Faace lies flat,  
I see my reflection.  
Download thoughts,  
But your files are corrupted,  
Don't just sit there and stare at me,  
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
I'm tired of what we are,  
I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
Time stands still,  
And you're frozen in motion.  
Held down your escape,  
But you're crashing,  
You're crashing.  
Don't just sit there and stare at me,  
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
I'm tired of what we are,  
I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm losing you, we're losing...
