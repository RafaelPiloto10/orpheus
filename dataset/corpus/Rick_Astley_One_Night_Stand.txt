It Was An Ordinary Night  
At Least It Started Out That Way  
Two Ordinary People  
Sharing Thoughts At The End Of The Day  
  
Was It The Wine That Made Her Sparkle Made Her Shine  
I Crossed That Line It Was Only Meant To Be  
  
A One Night Stand  
Here I Am With Empty Hands  
Wasn't Looking For Love And I Knew From The Start  
It Was A One Night Stand  
  
She Was Only Passing Through  
But It Suited Me Just Fine  
Emotional Attachment Never Crossed My Mind  
  
Was It The Light That Played A Trick On My Mind  
I Crossed That Line It Was Only Meant To Be  
  
She Was Only Passing Through
