Breathe in, breathe out,  
Restless, waiting for anything  
Tension is thick in the air  
Are you gonna lead or follow me?  
Full speed, turn up the overdrive  
Make me feel glad that I'm alive  
It's time we finally made our move  
So come on so come on come on, now  
  
Let's go, let's jump right in  
Scream into the wind  
Feel the fire within  
I can't ignore this burning in my soul  
Come on, baby, let's go  
We might fall fast  
We might fall hard  
But I can take it, I need to know  
So come on, baby, go  
  
Fever in my eye  
Starts racing back and forth in my mind  
I feel emotions rush through me  
Stirring such passion inside of me  
Are we regressing or taking flight  
I'd rather be loud than just stay quiet  
It's time to make a move  
It's time, we've got nothing to lose  
Come on, Come on, Come on, now  
  
Let's go, let's jump right in  
Scream into the wind  
Feel the fire within  
I can't ignore this burning in my soul  
Come on, baby, let's go  
  
We might fall fast  
We might fall hard  
But I can take it, I need to know  
So come on, baby, go  
  
No one to stand in our way  
And nothing's holding us back  
Doesn't matter what they say  
It's just you and me  
I'm so glad it turns out what I didn't know,  
And I was too scared to show  
Lose control of my soul  
Come on, now  
  
Let's go, let's jump right in  
Scream into the wind  
Feel the fire within  
I can't ignore this burning in my soul  
Come on, baby, let's go  
  
We might fall fast  
We might fall hard  
But I can take it, I need to know  
So come on, baby, go  
  
Breathe in,  
Breathe out,  
Go,  
Breathe in,  
Go,  
Breathe out,  
Breathe out,  
Breathe out.
