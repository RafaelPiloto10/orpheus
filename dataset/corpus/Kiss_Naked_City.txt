All the victims have turned to stone,  
No one is happy, they're all alone  
I'd sacrifice my social position tonight  
In New York, millionaires, and lonely people with lonely stares  
I'm not lookin' for love and I'm lost in this night  
In the naked city (in the city)  
There are ten million stories (naked city)  
I'm not lookin' for pity (in the city)  
In this naked city (naked city)  
Street vampires in the night, young lovers and love at first sight  
This is my flesh and my fantasy  
Older women with younger men, I've got a feelin' I'm in trouble again  
But I've got to live my destiny  
In the naked city (in the city) it's a race with the devil (naked city)  
All the pain and the sorrow (in the city)  
Is there more tomorrow (naked city)  
In the naked, naked city (in the city) naked city  
Lonely people lookin' for someone, lonely people goin' their way  
Lonely people lookin' for something, lonely people goin' their way  
In New York, millionaires, lonely people with lonely stares  
I'm not lookin' for love and I'm lost in this night  
In the naked city, there are ten million stories  
I'm not lookin' for pity in this naked city  
In the naked, naked city (in the city),  
It's a race with the devil (naked city)  
All the pain and the sorrow (in the city)  
Is there more tomorrow (naked city)  
(In the city, naked city)
