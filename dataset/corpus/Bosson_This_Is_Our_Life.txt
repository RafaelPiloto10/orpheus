Baby this is our life  
And I still believe that love is the answer  
This is our life  
I sit alone on the balcony  
In the middle of the night  
And everything is calm  
And everything is right  
Thinking back on the time  
I was depending on somebody  
Tellin' me what to do  
I know what to do  
Because we're born with freedom  
We can live our lives  
The way we want  
And just the way we feel  
We will discover the truth  
For me, it's love  
My love is true  
Baby this is our life  
I still believe that love is the answer  
This is our life  
I still believe our love will last forever  
This is our life  
Baby this is our life  
This is our life  
We're heading into the future  
But we're running out of time  
And we're running out of gas  
We forget why we're here  
If we stop for a moment  
Give it all up for care  
I'm taking care of you  
Take good care of me  
Because we're born with freedom  
We can live our lives  
The way we want  
And just the way we feel  
And if we follow our heart  
We will discover the truth  
For me, it's love  
My love is true  
Take care of yourself  
Be nice to your friends  
And visit your relatives once in a while  
Give love to your family  
Take care of your baby  
Don't be afraid to open your heart
