Let me tell you  
  
Jenny's getting dressed up  
In my room  
Puts on her skirt and  
She's looking good  
Six am and she's leaving soon  
Says  
"What a crazy night  
I had a real good time"  
But her kiss tells me  
It's goodbye  
Just like nothing  
Happened last night  
But if I had one chance  
I'd do it all over again  
  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
She was only looking  
For a night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
No no  
  
Now I'm left up  
In my lonely room  
She left her underwear  
And her perfume  
I never thought  
It could be this good  
And I still feel her lips  
Up on my fingertips  
I'm trying hard  
Not to feel rejected  
Maybe the phone line's disconnected  
But if I had one chance  
I'd do it all over again  
  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
She was only looking  
For a night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
She was only looking  
In night stand  
But I'd do it  
All over again for sure  
  
Baby like a blind man  
I rushed in now  
Do I have the right to ask  
"Will you be coming back again?"  
  
(One night stand  
I don't think she's coming back  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming back  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming back)  
  
One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more  
She was only looking  
One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more  
She was only looking for a one night stand I don't think she's coming back for
more  
She was only looking for a one night stand I don't think she's coming back for
more  
She was only looking  
One night stand but I'd do it all again for sure  
  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I know it, yeah
