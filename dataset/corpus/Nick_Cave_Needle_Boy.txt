At the turn of the century I did many things to protect myself  
I did many things to protect myself  
I made myself a needle-boy  
And I Hid him in the closet  
And I made myself a money-man  
And I hid him underneath the mattress  
I made myself a spider-child  
And I put him in a matchbox  
And I forged myself a golden statuette  
And I wrapped him in a hello magazine  
And I hid I'm in a wall safe  
And finally I made myself a spade-girl  
And I put her in a garden she'd  
All to protect myself, you see  
From the demon that was coming from the East  
Or from the west  
Then I sat on the rooftop and I waited  
And when at last the demon came  
From the East or from the West  
And awoke me from my sleep  
And awoke me to a particular point of view  
And the needle-boy stuck him in the eye  
And the money-man chocked him with coins  
The spider-child bit him on the ankle  
And the statuette crashed crashed down upon his head  
And the spade-girl buried him underneath the house  
And I danced on the rooftops  
And I danced on the rooftops  
And I danced to the western world  
And I danced to the western world
