From a far off galaxy, I hear you calling me  
We are on an odyssey  
Through the realms of time and space  
In that enchanted place  
You and I come face to face  
  
Once upon not yet, long ago someday  
Countless times we've met, met along the way  
  
Through the luminescent night  
On beams of neon light  
You and I in winged flight  
As we cross the starry sea, powered by what we see  
Now and then, the victory  
  
There's a child in a sun-dress  
Looking at a rainy sky  
There's a place in the desert  
Where an ocean once danced by  
There's a song in the silence  
Weaving in and out of time  
We are notes in the music  
Searching for remembered rhyme  
  
On a mountain high somewhere  
Where only heroes dare  
Stand the stallion and the mare  
We have been and we shall be each other's destiny  
One another's odyssey  
  
There's a child in a sun-dress  
Looking at a rainy sky  
There's a place in the desert  
Where an ocean once did lie  
There's a song in the silence  
Weaving in and out of time  
We are notes in the music  
Searching for remembered rhyme  
  
We've met along the way  
We've met along the way
