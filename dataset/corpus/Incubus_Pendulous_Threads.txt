Mend this careless thread, it?s gone askew  
(Thread on my sweater is pendulous, step back and pull it  
Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet)  
Or pull and see how much we can undo  
(Thread on my sweater is pendulous, step back and pull it  
Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet)  
On a burning bridge  
Your options are minimal at best  
Depending on where you're standing  
And how much breath is in your chest  
If it came down to it  
Would you high-tail home and hide?  
Or dance on fire and enjoy the ride

At the heart of it all  
That innermost, your fiery core  
There's an amassing armor  
It?s building you into a bore  
Life?s a match in a gas tank  
Don't ever mourn the ebbing tide  
Just dance on fire  
And enjoy the ride, hey
