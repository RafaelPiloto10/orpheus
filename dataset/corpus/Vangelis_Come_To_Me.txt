Come to me  
While I'm sleeping,  
So their wagging tongues  
Might not find you, my love!  
  
All the while  
They lie down,  
Our lighter souls fuse,  
Fly and dive, my love.  
  
So, stamp this night so strong,  
That I will remember  
And have it ever after!  
  
Come to me  
In my dreaming,  
So their wagging tongues  
Might not find you, my love!  
  
'Round the corner,  
Back of hands,  
They'll still be talking  
Whether or not we'd ever,  
Whether we'd ever, my love.
