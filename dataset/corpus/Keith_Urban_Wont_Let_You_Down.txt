Everybody says  
That when it comes to friends  
The truest ones are counted on one hand  
But take a look around  
Before you hit the ground  
The only one you'll see will be this man  
  
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall  
'Cause I'm the one who loves you  
You'll never wonder if I care  
I'll always be there  
Standin' there in losin' ground  
I'm your best friend now  
And I won't let you down, no, oh  
  
Yes, I've been a fool  
But I've learned what not to do  
Don't take for granted those who keep their faith in you  
And if you lose your way  
On some rainy day  
Just look above  
And I will be the sunshine breakin' through  
  
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall  
'Cause I'm the one who loves you  
You'll never wonder if I care  
I'll always be there  
Standin' there in losin' ground  
I'm your best friend now  
And I won't let you down  
  
And every step along the highway  
Of your life  
I'll be the man standing beside you  
Believe me that I will  
Don't forget: you came, and you saved me  
You saved my life  
  
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall  
'Cause I'm the one who loves you  
You'll never wonder if I care  
I'll always be there  
Standin' there in losin' ground  
'Cause I'm your best friend now  
And I won't let you  
I will not let you  
I won't let you down
