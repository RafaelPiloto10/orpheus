Perhaps I'll never show this world all I could be  
  
I just can't sing to any man the song he wants to hear  
And I know that some won't like me  
  
Others try to be my friend  
But I'm all of me, and that's all that I am  
  
Chorus:  
And if life is for the living  
  
Then why can't men be real  
  
'Stead of hidin' in their costumes  
  
Forgettin' how to feel, forgettin' how to feel  
  
We still live in a time when manners cover what is real  
  
There's a basic fact of life that the times cannot conceal  
That if some are masqueraders  
  
Others live in their facade  
But I'm what I am  
  
I cannot be what I am not  
  
Chorus  
  
I may be too honest and offend those who pretend  
  
I don't claim I'm always right, that I'm ev'rybody's friend  
Perhaps for them it's easier to be what they are not  
  
But I'm what I am, and I just can't play that part  
  
Chorus
