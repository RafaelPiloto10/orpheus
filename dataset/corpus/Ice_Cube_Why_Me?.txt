[Verse 1]  
Why the fuck you wanna murder me?  
Your punk ass never heard of me  
I never did nothin' to your family  
Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly  
You wanna take the life God handed to me  
Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan to me  
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me  
That's an animal,  
A fucking cannibal  
I'm Duranimo and Hannibal  
We international Gangsta bull  
I'm bull and Barcelona, with a Corona  
You a fake ass nigga, where's ya owner?  
I'm real live man, you a persona  
Now I'm a goner, call ma momma, in the corner  
Mister gun man, your plan is working  
Cause niggas is dieing and mommas is hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna murder me?  
You never ever heard of me  
You don't know who I am  
I could be part of your family tree  
Now  
Sent by G.O.D  
To save the word you and me  
You never know who you facin'  
Who ya chasin'  
The life you wastin'  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was made by the one and only G.O.D  
To take my life to the T.O.P  
Now here comes a motherfuckin' D.O.G  
Who ain't happy til a nigga is R.I.P  
Tryin' to be somethin' you saw on BET  
Either T.I.P or B.I.G  
I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV  
But a 187 don't make a O.G.  
  
I'm a O.G  
Never had to fake it  
God gave me this, how you goin' take it  
What you goin' tell 'em, when you get to heaven  
When he asks you why did you send back his present.  
Who the fuck are you, you motherfucking peasant  
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing.  
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes  
Nigga, hell on earth is being stuck in the 80's  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Before you shoot me man think about it  
Lets go have a drink about it  
Before you make a stink about it  
Man lets talk about it  
Maybe we can walk about it.  
But just don't be a coward  
And take my life 'cause you got the power  
Of the white mans gun powder  
Cause you might face a gun tower.  
And time never run out,  
They take the fun out, til your life run out.  
So don't pull your gun out,  
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house.  
It's better than a big house,  
Less four-five some woman we can dig out,  
Find a place we can dig out,  
Party all night til the owner say 'get out'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dedicated to all the niggas, that's dead and don't know why.  
Who wanna look at the nigga who shot 'em  
And ask these questions.  
  
Why me homie? Why me?
