(Jackson Browne)  
  
[Unreleased Jackson Browne song, sung in concert a few times]  
  
It wasn't me at your window, Baby.  
It wasn't me at your door.  
It must have been some other fool  
With his heart in his hand,  
Coming back for more.  
  
I was there when you closed your eyes.  
But it wasn't me when you came.  
I just thought I heard you call my name.  
  
You were there when I needed someone  
With your warmth and your style.  
I was back in the world again  
And it was real for awhile.  
  
I was ready for love to be coming,  
But not for what love became,  
And I thought I heard you call my name.  
  
Call my name.  
Now there was something only we knew together  
Far too simple to explain.  
Love smiled on us just like forever.  
  
You're always leaving town.  
First you come around.  
Then you can't be found  
It always brings me down.  
  
There's nothing wrong with my heart, Baby.  
There's nothing wrong with the world.  
If a girl don't feel the same way I feel,  
There's nothing wrong with the girl.  
  
Maybe we were too different to love each other.  
Maybe too much the same.  
Anyway, I thought I heard you call my name.  
  
Call my name.  
Like you were drifting away down the river.  
All my voices and curses in the pain  
Love flows on just like forever.  
  
You're always leaving town.  
First you come around.  
Then you can't be found  
And it always brings me down.  
  
Da da da da da  
Da da da dum dum dum  
Da da da  
Ohhhh no no no no no no  
Na na na na na  
  
Just like forever.  
Da da da da da  
Just like forever.  
Just like forever
