We see the light of those who find  
A world has passed them by  
To late to save a dream that's growing cold  
We realize that fate must hide its face  
From those who try  
To see the distant signs of unforetold  
Oh oh, take hold  
  
From a haze came a rage of thunder  
Distant signs of darkness on the way  
Fading cries scream of pain and hunger  
But in the night the light will guide your way  
  
So take hold of the flame  
Don't you see life's a game  
So take hold of the flame  
You've got nothing to lose, but everything to gain  
  
Ride, to a place beyond our time  
Reach, for the edges of your mind, and you are there  
See, that the light will find its way  
Back to a place where it will stay, make it stay  
  
Throw down the chains of oppression that bind you  
With the air of freedom the flame grows bright  
We are the strong, the youth united  
We are one, we are children of the light  
  
So take hold of the flame  
Don't you see life's a game  
So take hold of the flame  
You've got nothing to lose, but everything to gain
