Off to the races, I'm going places  
Might be a long shot, not gonna waste it  
This is the big break,  
And it's callin' my name, yeah  
  
So far, so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
  
So far, so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Takin' a ride with chance on my side  
I can't wait, so far, so great  
  
Might need to wing it, still gonna bring it  
Not gonna sink, no, I'm going swimming  
Swing for the fences, sky's not the limit today  
Yeah  
  
So far, so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
  
So far, so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Takin' a ride with chance on my side  
I can't wait, so far, so great  
  
Everyone says don't get your hopes up  
Learn the ropes and climb the ladder  
I know in the end, just being here is the best  
And it only gets better  
It only gets better! Yeah yeah!  
  
So far, so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
  
So far, so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Takin' a ride with chance on my side  
Yeah, I can't wait, so far, so great  
I can't wait, so far, so great
