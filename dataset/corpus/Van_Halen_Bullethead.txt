My karma just ran over your dogma.  
I can feel your pain.  
If everything is coming your way  
You're facing the wrong lane.  
  
Bullethead,  
Bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.  
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead  
Got a different kind of true.  
Bullethead,  
Yes you are in danger.  
I drive just like you!  
  
How many roads must a man walk down  
Before he admits he's lost.  
And do you really, really drive this way  
Just to piss me off?  
  
Boldly going nowhere,  
Trouble busting through.  
Yeah, I'm rolling slowly  
But I'm ahead of you.  
  
Bullethead,  
Bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.  
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead  
Got a different kind of true.  
Bullethead,  
Yes you are in danger.  
I drive just like you!  
  
Well I'm a lovin' the horn baby.  
Well I'm a bullethead.  
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come on baby  
Well I'm a bullethead.  
  
Hurt me!  
  
Traffic is giving you trouble?  
I can feel your pain.  
No light at the end of the tunnel  
Due to budget constraints.  
  
Some days you're the dog,  
Some days you're the hydrant.  
If everything is going your way  
You're facing the wrong lane.  
  
Bullethead,  
Bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.  
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead  
Got a different kind of true.  
Bullethead,  
Yes you are in danger.  
I drive just like you!
