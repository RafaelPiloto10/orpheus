I see she  
Knowing what I came here for  
Get a little of your womanifestation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it grow  
We can draw the line on where we  
Let the fingers go  
  
Now I know me  
Never wanna lose control  
Making me the subject  
Of your warm initiation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it show  
You make me nervous but it's now or never  
  
Oh Oh  
You can be my message from above  
And it's time to say you're sorry  
We can sanctify our love  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the wind  
You can't just go movin' out  
You can't leave me when I'm movin' in  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover  
  
It's you or me  
Gotta be a kill or cure  
Maybe undergo a lover's operation  
Nothing cuts like a knife can  
You don't wanna hurt me more  
Look at all that damage  
We could do together  
  
Oh no  
You can wear me closer to the bone  
It don't work to make me worry  
But the demon seed is sown  
  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the sky  
You can't make me hold on  
Better you shoot my love between the eyes  
  
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie  
And what I see as fact is fiction  
You won't let me die  
And I'm bound to be abused  
I won't let you cut me loose  
This love is out to get you  
When the blood begins to flow
