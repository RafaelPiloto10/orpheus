With a glass eye on you  
With a glass eye on you  
Electric eye on you  
Who loves to be touched  
With a glass eye on you  
Electric eye on you  
Who could dance like you, dance like you, pleasure  
Dance like you, delay  
Keep it simple, one foot goes down, keep it simple  
One foot in front of the other  
Keep it simple, one, to repeat  
Never to part the sky  
One, to repeat  
Can you feel the darkness  
On you like a dog?  
With a glass eye on you  
Electric eye on you  
Who loves to be touched  
With a glass eye on you  
Who could dance like you, pleasure all day  
Can you feel it?  
I'm holding the moth, moth  
I'm holding the moth  
Floating under the net  
Fall down to my knees, kiss off, kiss off  
In the rain, stain, to embrace the mouth of every day  
Every car that never came  
You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me  
When do we get out of here, this perfect skin  
With a glass eye on you  
Electric eye on you  
Who loves to be touched  
Who could dance like you, dance all day  
Keep it simple, keep it  
One foot goes down in front of the other  
One foot in front of the other  
Never part this sky  
Real thing  
Is this your version?  
Only a copy  
Leap on, leap off  
But I don't know you  
And I don't remember you  
I need a light on  
In matted soul and disconnected  
Why didn't you call  
Why didn't I call, to laugh with you  
Bouncing, bouncing  
Is it play town? is it play town?  
Roll the ball with the blue slush cup  
Date line, be my cell phone connection  
With a glass eye on you  
Electric eye on you  
Who loves to be touched  
Who could dance like you, pleasure all day  
Keep it simple  
One foot goes down in front of the other  
One foot in front of the other  
One, to ever part this sky  
You feel  
You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me  
You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me  
You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me  
When do we get out of here  
This perfect skin  
This perfect skin  
This perfect skin  
You walked away, you walked away  
You took me home, you took me in, you left me  
When do we get out of here, this perfect skin  
With a glass eye on you  
Electric eye on you  
Who loves to be touched  
Who could dance like you, dance all day  
Keep it simple  
One foot goes down in front of the other  
One foot in front of the other  
Never part this sky  
Real thing
