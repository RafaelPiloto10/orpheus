Aah, aah  
In the land where horses born with eagle wings  
And honey bees have lost their stings  
There's singing forever, ooh yeah  
Lion's den with fallow deer  
And rivers made from wine so clear  
Flow on and on forever  
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air  
And baby lambs where Samson dares  
To go on on on on on on  
  
My fairy king can see things  
He rules the air and turns the tides  
That are not there for you and me  
Ooh yeah he guides the winds  
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong  
  
Ah, then came man to savage in the night  
To run like thieves and to kill like knives  
To take away the power from the magic hand  
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah  
  
They turn the milk into sour  
Like the blue in the blood of my veins  
Why can't you see it  
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain  
Son of heaven set me free and let me go  
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand  
Seasons fly no helping hand  
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah  
  
Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings  
Broken my fairy circle ring  
And shamed the king in all his pride  
Changed the winds and wronged the tides  
Mother Mercury Mercury  
Look what they've done to me  
I cannot run, I cannot hide  
La la la la la la la la la la la la
