Part of me won't go away  
Everyday reminded how much I hate it  
Weighted against the consequences  
Can't live without it, so it's senseless  
Wanna cut it out of my soul  
And just live with a gaping hole  
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste  
I made the problems in the first place  
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me  
You hardly see it right next to the heart of me  
Heard of me, the routine scar  
New cuts cover where the old ones are  
And now I'm sick of this  
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity  
I rather not even be then the man  
That's staring in the mirror through me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it  
Once it's been dealt with you feel like  
You've been touched by something angelic  
And then melted down into a pool of peace  
Cease to be the animal you used to be  
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong  
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone  
And then you start to see another piece  
Of yourself that you can't let be  
Memories of the last fight to free yourself  
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well  
And now you know that you can choose  
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise  
You can live if you're willing to  
Put a stop to just what's killing you  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
This part of me won't go away  
Part of me won't go away  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be  
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be  
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me
