Lately love keeps keeping up at night  
Tossing and turning, my love  
Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you real tight  
Ooo but I wonder love whether you know or not  
You just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock  
  
I just wanna be the one that you wanna see  
I just wanna have you near me  
But you fly away almost everyday  
You work a lot but you never stop to love  
  
Stop, I love you so stop  
Come home from the road  
Gotta stop to love  
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop  
Say you're coming home  
  
You say my love has always been on your mind  
But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime?  
Too many empty nights, can make almost any guy roam  
to look for the love he don't get whenever he's at home alone.  
  
Awaiting the day that you're coming to stay  
I hate to see you go away, but you couldn't rest  
Had to do your best to reach the top  
But you did not stop to love  
  
Stop, I love you so stop  
Come home from the road  
Gotta stop to love  
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop  
Say you're coming home  
  
And one day you'll discover I'm the one who love ya  
Gotta stop to love  
No one loves you better  
Can't you stay forever?  
Stop to love  
I can hardly stand the loneliness  
Come on home, that's what it's all about  
You really turn me out  
  
Stop, I love you so stop  
Come home from the road  
Gotta stop to love  
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop  
Say you're coming home
