Seems to me that we've been friends forever  
We spend our time together as all good friends will do  
But the silence only lies  
If you could read my eyes  
They hold another feeling  
I could show you  
  
Maybe you should know  
Just how much I love you  
In my heart there's no one else above you  
Maybe I should hope  
You find out for yourself somehow  
Or maybe I should tell you now  
  
Maybe I should wait and take the chances  
A good dancer never dances  
Until he hears the cue  
But the orchestra is gone  
They've left us all alone  
There's no one here to tell me how to tell you  
  
Maybe you should know  
Just how much I love you  
In my heart there's no one else above you  
Maybe I should hope  
You find out for yourself somehow  
Or maybe I should tell you  
Maybe I should tell you  
Maybe I should tell you now
