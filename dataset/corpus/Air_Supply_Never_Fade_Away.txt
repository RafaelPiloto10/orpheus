Walking along the boulevard  
Speaking into the air  
Where can I find the life  
I know that only dreams can share  
I close my eyes and see you there  
Calling me far beyond  
Wrapped in a robe of mystery  
You wave your magic wand  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can fly to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
Walking along the boulevard  
Wishing we were complete  
Why are some things so very hard to witness and believe  
  
The victor of this universe  
The victim of the wind  
Where does a dream begin and end  
And where does life begin  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can climb to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
We can climb to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away
