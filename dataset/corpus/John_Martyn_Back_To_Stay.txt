Although I've been away so many lonely nights  
You know I'm back today, I'm back to stay in your arms  
Although I've been around and lived the life I said I loved  
You know without you honey, all I do is worth nothing  
And girlie, don't cry for me  
Although there might be other people in my life  
Honey, on my mind, you will always find there's only you  
And though you say you'll journey to some foreign land  
I'll remember you, yes, and I'll be true to your memory  
And when at last you do come wandering home to me  
I might look at you but it will be through the weeks between  
And when I hold you it might not be you I have  
In the passing days, we might both have changed to something new
