I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.  
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly.  
I'm crying.  
  
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come.  
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday.  
Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long.  
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.  
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.  
  
Mister City Policeman sitting  
Pretty little policemen in a row.  
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run.  
I'm crying, I'm crying.  
I'm crying, I'm crying.  
  
Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye.  
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess,  
Boy, you been a naughty girl you let your knickers down.  
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.  
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.  
  
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun.  
If the sun don't come, you get a tan  
From standing in the English rain.  
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.  
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob.  
  
Expert textpert choking smokers,  
Don't you thing the joker laughs at you?  
See how they smile like pigs in a sty,  
See how they snied.  
I'm crying.  
  
Semolina pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower.  
Elementary penguin singing Hari Krishna.  
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Alan Poe.  
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.  
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob.  
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob g'goo.
