They say this guy's,  
This guy's in love with you  
Yes, I'm in love  
Who looks at you the way I do?  
When you smile, I can tell  
We know each other very well  
  
How can, I show you?  
That, I got to know you  
  
'Cause I've heard some talk  
They say you think I'm fine, yeah  
Yes, I'm in love, I'm in love baby  
And what I'ld do to make you mine  
Tell me now, is it so?  
  
My hands are shaking  
Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause  
  
I need your love  
I want your love  
Say you're in love  
In love, with this guy  
If not, I'll just sigh  
  
Tell me now,  
Is it so?  
Don't le me be  
The last to know  
  
My hands are shaking  
Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause  
  
I need your love  
I want your love  
Say you're in love  
In love, with this guy  
If not, I'll just sigh
