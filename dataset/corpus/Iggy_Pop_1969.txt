Well it's 1969 OK  
All across the USA  
It's another year for me and you  
Another year with nothing to do  
  
Last year I was 21  
I didn't have a lot of fun  
And now I'm gonna be 22  
I say oh my and a boo-hoo  
  
It's 1969 OK all across the USA  
It's another year for me and you  
Another year with nothing to do  
Another year with nothing to do  
  
It's 1969  
1969  
1969  
1969  
1969 baby  
And it's 1969 baby  
Baby  
Baby
