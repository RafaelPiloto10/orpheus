Seen all good things and bad  
Running down the hill  
All so  
Battered and  
Brought to the ground  
I am hungry again  
I am drunk again  
With all the money I owe to my friends  
  
When I'm like this how can you be smiling  
Saying  
How can you be sure?  
How can you be sure?  
  
If you walk out the door  
Will I see you again?  
If so much of me lies in your eyes  
I am hungry again  
I am drunk again  
With all the money I owe to my friends  
  
When I'm like this how can you be smiling  
Saying  
How can you be sure?  
(I don't want you anymore)  
How can you be sure?  
(I don't want you anymore)  
How can you be sure?  
(I don't want you anymore)  
How can you be sure?  
  
I don't want you  
I don't want you anymore  
I don't want you  
I don't want you anymore
