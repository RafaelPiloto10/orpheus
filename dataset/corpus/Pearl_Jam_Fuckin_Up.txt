Neil Young) (various dates)  
Mindless drifter on the road...why do I...  
Carry such an easy load...why do I...  
It's how you look, and how you feel...why do I...  
You must have a heart of steel...why do I...  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
I can see you on a hill...why do I...  
Comatose but walking still...why do I...  
Curves beneath your flowing gown ...why do I...  
Only I could bring you down...why do I...  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
Dogs that lick and dogs that bite...why do I...  
Hounds that howl through the night...why do I...  
Broken leashes all over the floor...why do I...  
Keys left hanging in a swinging door...why do I...  
Why do I keep fuckin' up?  
Fuckin' up...fuckin' up...fuckin' up
