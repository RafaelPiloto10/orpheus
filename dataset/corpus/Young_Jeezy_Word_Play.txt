[Chorus]  
You niggas want word play  
But I'm bout bird play  
1st of them month, yea we call that bird day  
Just look at em' fly (hey) [Repeat: x2]  
You niggas want word play  
But I'm bout bird play  
3rd of the month, yea we call that bird day  
Just look at em' fly (hey) [Repeat: x2]  
  
I'm way too intelligent  
To play wit my intelligence  
What you trying to say?  
What I'm sayings not relevant?  
I still represent  
Cause I'm a representa  
3 Benz and just for a 9 PC chicken dinner  
Young boss right back like a rubber band  
Bought a whip "look y'all, no hands"  
"Stop this nonsense where's your roof?"  
All dis nonsense, there's no use  
Married to the game yea we just got eloped  
Depending on the shipment we might need a boat  
I'm talking big money anybody any on the case  
Yea we switched up the status now we on to the states  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It just a waste wit all hip hop  
Young killed hip hop?  
"don't you know this dumb nigga still talkin' crack rocks"  
Got everybody followin' that makes him a leader  
And he got to get indicted just to make u a believer  
If that's that case then I really do apologize  
That I memorize  
And I fantasize  
Then I visualize  
And I strategize  
One false move will get your ass penalized  
Nigga you can't be serious  
What if Pac was hearing this  
"You bullshitting me?"  
I'm sure biggie would agree  
If he had to pass the torch, then that bitch'll go to me  
Now wouldn't you agree? does it matter? I accept  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have you ever see a blue rolls go on the black grass?  
Nigga go broke in investing a black mask  
Entrepreneur he found him a new crack  
A round of applause congratulate that nigga  
Cause when he get rich they goin' hate that nigga  
They goin' try they best to try n break that nigga  
  
[Chorus]
