Your blood speaks a better word  
Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth  
Speaks righteousness for me  
And stands in my defense  
Jesus it's Your blood  
  
What can wash away our sins?  
What can make us whole again?  
Nothing but the blood  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
What can wash us pure as snow?  
Welcomed as the friends of God  
Nothing but Your blood  
Nothing but Your blood King Jesus  
  
Your cross testifies in grace  
Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us  
Now boldly we approach  
Not by earthly confidence  
It's only Your blood
