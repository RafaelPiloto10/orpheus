She says she wants to see me  
She's tired of stayin in  
She says she wants some rockin'  
Shes got the right man  
I'm gonna take her ridin'  
Out past the edge of town  
Out where the wind's still racin' free on the heartland  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Can't wait for nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Ooh, nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be my baby  
She might be mine - tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be mine tonight  
  
I'm movin' in to action  
I'm shinin' up mt wheels  
I'm tryin' hard to think of the right things to say now  
The sun is slowly sinkin'  
Here comes a great big moon  
I'm startin' up my engine  
It won't be long now  
  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Can't wait for nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Ooh, nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be my baby  
She might be mine - tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be mine tonight
