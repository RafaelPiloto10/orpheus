[Verse 1]  
Greeks:  
In 776BC Olympics were begun  
Greece was the only country, so naturally we won  
Cheats built bronzes of God Zeus were we honest winners  
The answer's no we had more statues than you've had hot dinners  
Our games meant truce was called in war a peace every 4 years  
But wrestling was so violent that bouts could end in tears  
No girls allowed to watch or run that might sound rude  
But makes sense when I tell you we competed nude  
  
[Chorus]  
FLAME  
It's gonna burn forever  
Love for Olympic heroes  
FLAME  
We'd like one next however  
Sadly it's Emperor Nero  
Hey watch it you two, alright  
  
[Verse 2]  
Emperor Nero:  
I went from Rome to Greece so I could play them at their games  
In 67AD you know I won Olympic fame  
Told them to include a contest based on poetry  
Not much good for sportsmen no, but brilliant for me  
Crashed my racing chariot but still awarded gold  
Hey my Olympics my rules  
To argue would be bold  
I won every medal that was up for grabs  
The crowd loved it well they had to or I would have had them stabbed, OK?  
  
[Chorus]  
Greeks:  
FLAME  
  
Nero:  
Olympic champion that's me  
My games were emperors own round  
  
Greeks:  
FLAME  
  
Nero:  
Think I was bad in 393  
Christian Rome had them banned  
  
[Hook]  
all:  
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over  
  
Nero:  
  
SHAME  
  
[Verse 3]  
Baron de Coubertin:  
WAIT not so fast  
  
I'm Baron de Coubertin, a famous French historian  
I read of the Olympic Games thought I should try restoring them  
They'd be just like the old days I said but did propose  
That unlike Greeks Victorians should do them wearing clothes  
In 1896 we launched the games in dear old Greece  
Hoped it would make men more morale as well as less obese  
We built a stadium so we could start to play  
Games of the modern Olympics which we still have today  
  
[Chorus]  
All:  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin:  
I'm on my personal glory  
But no-one remembers my name  
  
All:  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin:  
So here to finish our story  
A man who has gold plated fame  
  
[Verse 4]  
Jesse Owens:  
I'm Jesse Owens fastest man in 1936  
I took home 4 gold medals yeah, but that's just the basics  
What you should know about the fact I was victorious  
Is, it made Herr Hitler mad ha it made him furious  
Hitler said Berlin should be the games Germanic base  
So he could show the world Aryans were the master race  
I won in 4 events he had to back pedal  
His evil theory destroyed with every medal  
  
[Chorus]  
All:  
FLAME  
It's gonna burn forever  
Olympics are never in doubt  
FLAME  
A fire of sporting endeavour  
You realise it's actually gone out  
Olympic, Olympic  
FLAME
