[Verse 1]  
Driving quick past [?] pass is 1000 feet high  
All in sky  
Pulling the clock down in the back of some pretty girl's ride  
You get high  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Avenues into this bowl for tips  
Foreign ships as long as girls ride on their [?]  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always summer breaking when we ride in the streets after dark  
We're always summer breaking hanging out near the boys in the park  
Summer is gone, summer breaking fall(?)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Give em new hell, got a new record to chill in your car  
Sing along  
It feels so good, doesn't know you're too bright and too calm  
Like a diamond  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Play your [?], playing away you forget [?]  
Baby girl, you can [?]  
  
[Chorus]  
We're always summer breaking when we ride in the streets after dark  
We're always summer breaking hanging out near the boys in the park  
[?]  
Summer is gone, summer breaking fall(?)
