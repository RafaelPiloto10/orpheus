Broken hearts, broken homes  
There's a war deep in motion  
Fighting hard to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
  
Breathing in, breathing out  
Missing life, living doubt  
Searching for a cure  
Some kind of open door  
  
Bring it back to the beginning  
To the first taste of shame  
A fallen world in waiting  
Only one could take the blame  
  
Fast forward to the ending  
One truth remains  
There's a miracle waiting  
For all who speak His name  
  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
  
And they can't take it from me  
Pleading the most worthy cause  
For the innocence we lost  
With his tears of blood  
  
He started freedom's flood  
As the world's opinions sway  
My beliefs will not be changed  
Nothing ever can take me from His hand  
  
Bring it back to the beginning  
To the first taste of shame  
A fallen world in waiting  
Only one could take the blame  
  
Fast forward to the ending  
One truth remains  
There's a miracle waiting  
For all who speak His name  
  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
  
And they can't take it from me  
Yeah, sure I remember  
Matter fact it was just last September  
She still calls it the fall to remember  
  
Little Heather when it all came together  
Said you remember the first time you met us?  
She cried when it rained and blamed the weather  
But inside she strained with suicide letters  
  
The kind of cold you couldn't warm with a sweater  
Hardly lasted past December  
Said she was headed down to defeat  
That's the last you'd seen, and never had dreamed  
  
That's the same little Heather It's who you saw last week  
In an instant you couldn't have missed her gleam  
As she listened She looked like a distant queen  
With a difference there for all to see  
  
She found a different, a different kind of free  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
  
It's a different kind of free  
And they can't take it from me  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
And they can't take it from me  
Take my life, my liberty  
  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
And they can't take it from me  
  
It's so much different  
It's a different kind of free  
And it's here for you and me  
It's a different kind of free  
  
And it's here to set you free  
It's a different kind of free
