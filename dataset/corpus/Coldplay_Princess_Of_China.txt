Once upon a time somebody ran  
Somebody ran away saying, "Fast as I can"  
I got to go  
I got to go  
  
Once upon a time we fell apart  
You're holding in your hands  
The two halves of my heart  
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
  
Once upon a time we're burning bright  
That all we ever seemed to do is fight  
On and on  
And on and on and on  
  
Once upon a time on the same side  
Once upon a time on the same side  
In the same game, now why'd you have to go  
Have to go and throw it all in my flame  
  
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king  
Could have had a castle and worn a ring  
But no, you let me go  
  
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king  
Could have had a castle and worn a ring,  
But no, you let me go  
  
Stole my star  
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la  
You stole my star  
La-la-la-la-la-la  
  
'Cause you really hurt me  
Oh you really hurt me  
'Cause you really hurt me  
Oh you really hurt me  
'Cause you really hurt me  
Oh-oh, you really hurt me  
'Cause you really hurt me  
You really hurt me
