She asked him for forever  
And a promise that would last  
He said, "Babe you know I love you  
But I can't commit to that"  
She said, "Love isn't love  
'Till you give it away"  
  
A father lived in silence  
Saw his son become a man  
There was a distance felt between them  
Cause he could not understand  
That love isn't love  
'Till you give it away  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
As we live  
Moving side by side  
May we learn to give  
Learn to sacrifice  
  
We can entertain compassion  
For a world in need of care  
But the road of good intentions  
Doesn't lead to anywhere  
Cause love isn't love  
'Till you give it away  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is like a river  
Flowing down from the giver of life  
We drink from the water  
And our thirst is no longer denied  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was a man who walked on water  
He came to set the people free  
He was the ultimate example  
Of what love can truly be  
Cause his love was his life  
And he gave it away  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]
