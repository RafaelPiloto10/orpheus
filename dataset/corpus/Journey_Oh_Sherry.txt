Steve Perry  
  
You should've been gone  
Knowing how I made you feel  
And I should've been gone  
After all your words of steel  
Oh I must've been a dreamer  
And I must've been someone else  
And we should've been over  
  
Oh Sherry, our love  
Holds on, holds on  
Oh Sherry, our love  
Holds on, holds on  
  
But I want to let go  
You'll go on hurtin' me  
You'd be better off alone  
If I'm not who you thought I'd be  
  
But you know that there's a fever  
Oh that you'll never find nowhere else  
Can't you feel it burnin' on and on  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
But I should've been gone  
Long ago, far away  
And you should've been gone  
Now I know just why you stay  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh Sherry, our love  
Holds on, holds on
