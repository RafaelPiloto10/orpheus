There's been a sayin' goin' round  
And I begin to think it's true  
It's awful hard to love someone  
When they don't care about you  
  
Once I had a lovin' gal  
The sweetest little thing in town  
But now she's gone and left me  
She done turn me down  
  
Now I ain't got nobody, and nobody cares for me!  
That's why I'm sad and lonely,  
Won't somebody come and take a chance with me?  
  
I'll sing you love songs, honey, all the time,  
If you'll only say you'll be sweet gal of mine,  
Oh, I ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me!  
  
I'll sing you love songs, honey, all the time,  
If you'll only say you'll be sweet gal of mine,  
Oh, I ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me!
