It's snowing angels, on my front porch  
Take a broom and sweep one in  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy  
Even though my shoes have broken  
I can't deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me one  
  
It's snowing angels  
By my window  
Take a net and fish one in  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy  
Even though I got no money  
This bear won't be hibernating  
Or I'd miss the sight of all the honey strolling by  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me one  
  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy  
Even though my shoes have broken  
I can't deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me  
Hope I'll catch me  
Hope I'll catch me one
