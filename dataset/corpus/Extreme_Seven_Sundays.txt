One day  
We'll find the time  
To spend, together  
Until then, my love  
  
If I had one wish  
It wouldn't be hard to choose  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Cause that's the day  
That I spend with you  
  
Someday soon,  
You and I  
Will hold each other  
Once again, my love  
  
If I had one wish  
It wouldn't be hard to choose  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Cause that's the day  
That I spend with you  
  
If I had one wish  
It wouldn't be hard to choose
