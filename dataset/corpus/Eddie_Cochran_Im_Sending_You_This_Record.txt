I'm sending you this record, please listen to it carefully  
The words are sayin' darling, I love you  
It looks like any other record, but it says oh-so easily  
The things that I can't say when I'm with you  
I spent all last week and the week before  
Down at the neighbourhood record store  
I've listened to a thousand tunes or more  
Till I found the one I was searchin' for  
So I'm sending you this record, please listen to it carefully  
The words are sayin' darling, I love you
