[Chorus:]  
Good mornin' blues, blues how do ya do?  
Good mornin' blues, blues how do ya do?  
Well I'm doing alright this morning, how are you?  
  
I woke up this morning  
Couldn't get outta my bed  
Oh I woke up this mornin'  
Couldn't get you outta my bed  
Went to eat my breakfast and  
The blues was all in my bread  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well the blues ain't nothing but a poor working man feeling down  
Lord, the blues ain't nothing but a poor working man feeling down  
That's about the meagerest feeling I done ever had  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sent for you yesterday, here you come walking today (hey)  
I sent for you yesterday, here you come walking today  
Yeah, your mouth's wide open  
You don't know what to say  
  
(I say) Goodmorning blues, blues how do you do? (yo yeah)  
Well goodmorning blues, blues how do you do? (hoo yeah)  
Well I'm doin' alright, blues how are you?  
Yeeeeeaaaah!
