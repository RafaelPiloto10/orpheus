If I believe in paradise,  
I swear I must be there.  
I swear I must be there right now with you.  
If I believe in miracles,  
I'd know that one was happening to me.  
  
But I don't believe in paradise  
And miracles are not real.  
Then, someone tell me what is this I feel?  
  
Chorus:  
I wanna believe it's love this time.  
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me lies.  
But with you I can't deny.  
If I believe in paradise,  
I swear...  
I'm there.  
  
If I believe in magic spells,  
It all would be so clear:  
A magic spell must have brought you here.  
If I can see the future,  
I'd see if you and I were meant to be.  
  
But I don't know any magic,  
And tomorrow's just a dream.  
Then something in this fantasy is real.  
  
I wanna believe it's love this time.  
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me lies.  
I wanna believe it's love this time.  
I wanna believe my heart's not telling me lies.  
But with you I can't deny  
If I believe in paradise, I swear...  
I'm there.  
  
I'm there...  
I swear...  
If I believe.
