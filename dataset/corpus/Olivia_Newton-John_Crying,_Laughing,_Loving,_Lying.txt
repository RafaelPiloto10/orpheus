Crying, crying never did nobody no good no how  
That's why I don't cry  
That's why I don't cry  
Laughing, laughing sometimes does somebody some good somehow  
That's why I--I'm laughing now  
That's why I--I'm laughing now  
Loving, loving never did me no good no how--no how  
That's why I can't love you now  
That's why I can't love you now  
Lying, lying never did nobody no good no how--no how  
So why am I lying now?  
So why am I lying now?  
So why am I lying now?
