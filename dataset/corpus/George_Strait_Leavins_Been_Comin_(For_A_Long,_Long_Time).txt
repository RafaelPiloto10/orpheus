It's never over 'til it's really over  
And someone's left standing behind  
It goes without sayin'  
It's too late for stayin'  
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I packed up my suitcase and started my pickup  
So many times in my mind  
It's a hard road to travel  
From blacktop to gravel  
And the next hill is the hardest to climb  
  
I've got all the answers for most of the questions  
And some ain't been easy to find  
There's no more erasin'  
The things I've been facin'  
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time  
  
[Chorus:]  
And leavin's been comin' for a long, long time
