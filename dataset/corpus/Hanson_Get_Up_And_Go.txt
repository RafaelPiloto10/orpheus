She plays guitar with her fingertips  
She'll play your heart with her tender lips  
She'll work it out until she makes the tips  
And it's alright, yeah it's alright  
Holding her tight in late December  
I look in the stars and I remember  
She doesn't mind when you offend her  
And it's alright, yeah it's alright  
  
Just a girl like you, and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me, maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and see  
Get up and go  
Just a girl like you, and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me, maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and take a look and go  
Get Up and Go  
  
What could I give when you've got all you need  
And she looks at me like all I want's a little free  
Every time I look at you it makes me see  
That it's alright, yeah it's alright  
We'll get away be in love we can make it better  
All I need's a little time for us to get together  
Happiness is just a step away  
When it's alright, yeah it's alright  
  
Just a girl like you, and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me, maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and see  
Get up and go  
Just a girl like you, and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me, maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and take a look and go  
  
Ooh oh, ooh oh, won't you go  
Ooh oh, ooh oh, won't you go  
Ooh oh, ooh oh, won't you go  
Take a look and, take a look and go  
  
Seems like love has always found a way  
But there's only so many hours in the day  
All that I know is that you're here with me  
And it's alright, yeah it's alright  
Won't you tell me that you need me so bad  
'Cause you are everything I've never had  
Every time I look at you it hurts so bad  
And it's alright, yeah it's alright  
  
Just a girl like you, and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me, maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and see  
Get up and go  
Just a girl like you, and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me, maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and take a look and go  
Get up and go
