When you're living for the love of  
A lifetime  
You wonder if the waiting will ever end  
And the right from the wrong  
That you've guarded so long  
Is closer that it's ever been  
But sometimes a moment of weakness  
Can sacrifice the treasure of time  
And cause you to miss the miracle  
That god longs for you to find  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a love he has for you  
There's a heart that he's been saving  
There's a joy beyond all measure  
That only comes from waiting  
There's a love he has for you  
It's more than the hope you're holding to  
And you will find the only love that's true  
Is the love he has for you  
  
When you're torn between today  
And tomorrow  
And holding out for something you  
Cannot see  
There's a strength you can find  
Knowing in god's own time  
You'll discover what he meant to be  
'Cause love like the father intended  
Is more than just a state of the heart  
So don't give up hope in the holding on  
'Cause no matter who you are  
  
[Chorus]
