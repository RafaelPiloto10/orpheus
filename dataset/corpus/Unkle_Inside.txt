Sample  
The only thing that burns in hell  
Is the part of you that won't let go of your life  
Your memories, your attachments  
They burn them all away,  
But they're not punishing you, they say  
They're freeing your soul, relax.  
  
Somethings gone  
This can't go on  
It's all been wrong  
For far too long  
  
Through all these tears  
No light appears  
And all that trust  
Has turned to dust  
  
So one things clear  
I wanna hear  
I wanna hear  
  
So break on through  
For something true  
'cause love's confused  
  
And love does see  
Sense in all of this  
Something's gotta give  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me  
  
In time  
You'll find  
In time  
You'll find  
  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
You don't wanna see  
Inside of me
