Took the ribbon from my hair  
And I'm letting it all hang down  
So, if you're lookin' for the same old me  
Gotta tell you that she's left town  
Don't try to call my number, baby  
You're gonna get no reply  
'Cause suddenly I'm changin'  
I'm finally rearrangin'  
  
In this day of liberation  
I'm lookin' to find my share  
What's the use of being patient?  
You ain't goin' nowhere  
I got my own two-step together  
And I want the first slow dance with you  
I just saw Venus risin'  
Guess I'm realisin'  
  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
And baby, you're the first to know  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
I took a little time to grow  
It's gonna be worth waiting  
The anticipating  
I'm not mama's little baby no more  
  
Well, I've been everyone's best friend  
Someone they could tell their troubles to  
How come they never noticed me  
And the pain that I was going through?  
I've seen the lonely side of living  
I never want to go back there again  
The sad old me is dyin'  
Tonight there is no denyin'  
  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
And baby, you're the first to know  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
I took a little time to grow  
It's gonna be worth waiting  
The anticipating  
I'm not mama's little baby no more  
  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
And baby, you're the first, the first to know  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
I took a little time, a time to grow  
It's gonna be worth the waiting  
The anticipating  
I'm not mama's little baby no more, no more  
  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
And baby, you're the first, the first to know  
I said I ain't mama's little girl no, no more  
I took a little time, a time to grow  
It's gonna be worth the waiting  
The anticipating  
I'm not mama's little baby no more, no more
