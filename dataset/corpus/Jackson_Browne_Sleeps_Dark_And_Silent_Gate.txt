Sometimes I lie awake at night and wonder  
Where my life will lead me  
Waiting to pass under sleep's dark and silent gate  
  
I found my love too late  
Running around day after day  
Looking for the time to play  
While my old friends slipped away  
  
Never shoulda had to try so hard  
To make a love work out, I guess  
I don't know what love has got to do with happiness  
But the times when we were happy  
Were the times we never tried  
  
(Sitting down by the highway)  
Looking down the road  
(Waiting for a ride)  
I don't know where I've been  
(Wishing I could fly away)  
Don't know where I'm going  
(Wishing I could hide)  
Oh, God, this is some shape I'm in  
When the only thing that makes me cry  
Is the kindness in my baby's eyes  
  
Sometimes I lie awake at night and wonder  
Where the years have gone  
They have all passed under  
Sleep's dark and silent gate
