(Rap lyrics)  
We have to give all the glory to the King of Kings  
And give honor and praise for long life and blessings now raise your hands up
wave them up in the sky and glorify the lord for he's the source of my life  
  
You are- the- source -of -my life  
And hope my life and hope is in you  
  
I will live and not die  
In Your presence satisfy  
(X3)  
  
You are- the- source -of -my life  
And hope of my life and hope is in you  
  
I will live and not die  
In Your presence satisfy  
(X3)  
  
You are- the- source -of -my life  
And hope and lover of my soul  
My future holder  
Day for sustainer  
Pass Redeemer  
  
For ever and ever and ever  
Por siempre  
  
With long life  
You will satisfy me,  
You will satisfy me,  
With long life...  
  
With long life  
You will satisfy me,  
You will satisfy me, oh  
With long life...  
  
I will praise you forever  
Forever, forever  
(Repeat x3)  
  
Only you can satisfy  
  
Nothing but you Lord  
You are the sustainer  
Your are the air I breath
