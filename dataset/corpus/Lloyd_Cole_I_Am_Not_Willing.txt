Never doubting  
Always faithful  
She returns  
She says she loves me  
And I could always  
Come to her  
She can't imagine how  
Another lover  
Could turn her head  
And I'm so grateful  
That I'm still willing  
To have her home  
She says she loves me  
She won't forget me  
And then she's gone  
She thinks that later  
We can pick up the pieces  
And carry on  
And I'd forgive her  
Still not suspecting  
She could be wrong  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing  
To have her home  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing  
To have her home
