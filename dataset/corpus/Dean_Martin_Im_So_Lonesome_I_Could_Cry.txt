Hear that lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is winding low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind the cloud  
To hide his face and cry  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I'm so lonesome I could cry
