Sunday, Sunday, here again in tidy attire  
You read the color supplement, the TV guide  
You dream of protein on a plate  
Regret you left it quite so late  
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep  
Oh, the Sunday sleep  
  
Sunday, Sunday here again, a walk in the park  
You meet an old soldier and talk of the past  
He fought for us in two world wars  
And says the England he knew is no more  
He sings the Songs of Praise every week but always falls asleep  
For the Sunday sleep  
  
You dream of protein on a plate  
Regret you left it quite so late  
To gather the family round the table to eat enough to sleep  
And Mother's Pride is your epithet  
That extra slice you will soon regret  
So going out is your best bet  
Then bingo yourself to sleep  
Oh, the Sunday sleep
