It's hard to say goodbye, it hurts to be alone  
And all that is left is a memory to love and keep as a part on me , that's
you. no one else but you, say what can I do?  
I miss you so. It's hard to let you go. It's hard to ease my pain, but I do it
all for you and I know you'll do the same and I hard it all me seem you are
always in my dream.  
And We will meet again far me on the stormy weathers for the on the cloud is
sky. Sweet we will meet again, when we do we were last forever, when we do we
were stayin'together you and me  
We we'll mean to be ohoh a perfect harmonie and every day will close by as
remaining me. Ther are so many things that you left with me. You see every
little thing as it's all stormy. There tell me and nowhere seems alone, help
me to be strong. you were meaning all my life and I'll kick a worry out, I'm
shouting out my pain, never spy away.We will meet again far me on the stormy
weathers for the on the cloud is sky. Sweet we will meet again, when we do we
were last forever, when we do we were stayin'together you and me.  
As a freer , as a mother, as a beautiful flower, as a wife, as a lover have me
climbing up your tower.  
As my garden your nature wonder your protection, as the lights on my life you
gave me so much reflection. I'm so acting on the once got to know you it was
hard for me to say but you told me with your chair, this light fear and I'll
never stop to livin' out time will come because there must'nt be a minute.  
We will meet again far me on the stormy weathers for the on the cloud is sky.
Sweet we will meet again, when we do we were last forever, when we do we were
stayin'together We will meet again far me on the stormy weathers for the on
the cloud is sky. Sweet we will meet again, when we do we were last forever,
when we do we were stayin'together  
You and me
