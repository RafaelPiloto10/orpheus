Baby's got sunshine 'cause she dances through the rain  
Momma's got a baby so she smiles through the pain  
Daddy's got a job so he's tired but inspired for a change  
Come out the window, you can see it from here  
It's like a new found restoration  
A destination that's clear, they've got each other  
And that's a whole lot more than some folks have it would be a crime  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we don't find a way to love somebody  
It would be a crime  
Now, I've got a dream and it started this way  
I get myself early up in the morning and it shines on my face  
Anytime you can find a reason and a place it'd be a crime  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we don't find a way to love somebody  
It would be a crime  
Some days make you want your feet on the ground  
Some days make you want to fly  
Some people make you want to keep your head down  
But you make me wanna try  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we don't find a way  
It would be a crime  
Oh, it would be a crime  
Yeah, it'd be a crime, it'd be a crime, be a crime
