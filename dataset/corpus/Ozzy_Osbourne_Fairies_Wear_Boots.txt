Goin' home, late last night  
Suddenly I got a fright  
Yeah I looked thought the window and surprised what I saw  
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!  
  
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies  
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!  
  
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me  
He said "Son, son, you've gone too far.  
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."
