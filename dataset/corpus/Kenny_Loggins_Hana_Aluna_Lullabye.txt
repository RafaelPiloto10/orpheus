Before you were born  
I saw you in the sunrise  
In the arms of my lover  
In the music of the islands  
And you were made of paradise  
Of ginger and pikake  
Wild mango and moonlight  
And dreams of our sweet ohana  
(Family)  
He lei poina ole ke keiki  
(A lei never forgotten is the beloved child)  
Aloha no, Hana Aluna  
(Our love to you, Hana Aluna)  
Tonight I rock you in my arms  
And sing of our tomorrows  
A song to call your own  
A vision of mohala  
(Opening as a flower)  
And this is my prayer  
My Hana Aluna lullabye  
Wherever live leads you  
Within you goes my aloha  
(Love and blessing)
