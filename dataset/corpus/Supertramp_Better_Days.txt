Trust me, I can help you  
Feel free, we can save you  
Join us in the good life  
And better days, better days  
  
Campaign for a new life  
Champagne and the bright lights  
Make way for the right way  
And better days, better days  
  
You didn't realize about the other life that we can give you  
We'll open up your eyes and make you see the light that's all around you  
We'll help you work it out and then you'll never doubt  
Our intuition, our vision, our decision, our mission, so listen  
  
No war, no inflation  
No more desperation  
You'll see we can show you  
Better days, better days  
  
More food, higher wages  
Good schools, smiling faces  
Make way for the new way  
Better days, better days  
  
We're going to lead you down to where the sun is always brightly shining  
We'll push away the clouds and show you there's a gold and silver lining  
We'll take away the pain, you'll want to try again  
You won't be sorry, so don't worry, don't worry, so hurry and join me
