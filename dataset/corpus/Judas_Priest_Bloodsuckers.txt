Don't speak to me of morality  
Justice wrong or right  
You dig up the dirt ignore the hurt  
And spit out all your lies  
  
Conscience free as we bleed  
Hypocrisy born from greed  
Don't preach to me of integrity  
Or your legal highs  
  
The judge's thrilled  
He's dressed to kill  
On TV every night  
  
Subliminal so absurd  
It's criminal yet can't be heard  
  
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night  
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites  
  
You will be on the stand today  
They cannot harm you it's okay  
But they will destroy your family  
And drag you through hell and tragedy  
  
A circus heading into town  
Complete with cameras and the clowns  
The First Amendment shot to bits  
The world is watching just for kicks  
  
As the day drew close to hand  
For all to view the faceless man  
He put out the lights it's sad  
Now who's to blame for that?  
  
Intimidate twist what you say  
With their fine points of law  
They lose the case but pontificate  
And then appeal some more  
  
Subliminal it's so absurd  
It's criminal but can't be heard  
  
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night  
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites  
  
Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night  
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites  
  
Promise to tell the truth  
The whole truth  
And nothing but the truth  
So help me God!  
  
You will be on the stand today  
They cannot harm you it's okay  
They will destroy your family  
And drag you through hell and tragedy  
  
Bloodsuckers parasites
