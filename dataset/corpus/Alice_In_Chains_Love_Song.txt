Love song, take one  
  
I love you and I'm coming back bitch  
I think I should say something  
I can't see you, I can't feel you, I can't, I can't  
  
Wash my face, cut out my teeth and tell me to grin  
My gums are bleeding  
My gums are bleeding  
  
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you  
Calling  
Don't forget your sheep  
First go up for air  
Get a fucking haircut  
Bring up the fleet  
Go fuck yourself  
What about  
Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung  
  
Get something, get, get them, get them  
Get the fuckin' midget  
Get the midget, get the midget  
Get the fuckin midget  
Kiss the fuckin' midget  
  
"Where the deer and antelope play"  
  
Kiss the midget, kiss the midget, kiss the midget, kiss the midget  
  
"That was perfect you guys, that was great!"
