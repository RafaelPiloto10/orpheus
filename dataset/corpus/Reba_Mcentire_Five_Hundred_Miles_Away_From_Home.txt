Tear drops fell on mama's note  
When I read the things she wrote  
She said, we miss you girl  
We love you come on home  
Well I didn't have to pack  
I had it all right on my back  
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home, away from home  
Cold and tired and all alone  
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home  
  
It's hard to tell the state I'm in  
Where I'm going, where I've been  
But there's a dream I've been following so long  
If mama knew the things I've done  
She'd forgive them everyone  
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home, away from home  
Cold and tired and all alone  
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home  
  
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait  
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home  
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight  
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home, away from home  
Cold and tired and all alone  
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home  
  
Lord, I'm still five hundred miles away from home
