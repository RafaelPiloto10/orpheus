My veins are poppin from this love inside  
I just can't let it out  
This pipe and these needles are my only guide  
They've got me on the wrong route  
  
What is my life about  
Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen  
Dreamin' like a lonely child  
I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too  
  
Man I wish you could see them too  
Oh Lord  
Oh Lord  
Man I wish that you could see them too  
Man I wish that you could see them too  
  
So can I come to see you sometime  
'Cause I been missin you  
I've never heard you cry I've never seen you whine  
I'm feeling oh so young  
But still I must die to get to you  
  
And if I do I wonder how just you will see me  
And implicate the things I've done  
I'm dyin in the shadows of this man I've never seen  
I'll see you soon  
Now where's my gun  
  
Oh Lord  
Oh Lord  
Oh Lord  
Where's my gun  
Oh where's my gun  
Oh Lord  
Where's my gun  
Oh Lord  
My gun  
  
Let me open your eyes  
Let me see who you are  
I am you, you are me  
We are a part of  
  
The second coming of christ  
It's God himself in a jar  
Yeah... yeah  
Yeah... yeah  
  
Let me open your eyes  
Let me see who you are  
I am you, you are me  
We are a part of  
  
The second coming of christ  
Its god himself in a jar  
Yeah  
Hey  
  
You got me, sad and lonely  
When I'm me...me  
You know you make me so lonely  
I am so alone  
  
And I will pray and then I'll cry  
And I will pray and then I'll cry  
And I will pray and then I'll cry  
And I will pray and then I'll cry
