There is a secret place  
Underneath a tree  
Where if you go and haste  
You will find a key  
The key will open doors  
And you will look inside  
The things that you will see  
Will open up your eyes  
  
At any given time  
On every other street  
The city comes to life  
Though everyone's asleep  
A man beats up his wife  
He doesn't want to keep  
Behind closed doors  
They're in retreat  
  
I don't know what makes me stay  
The city life just ain't the same  
There's something wrong with kids today  
I blame the parents anyway  
There's no hope  
No one to trust  
I can't cope  
It's obvious  
Please don't take my drugs away  
I'm gonna give them up someday  
  
There is a place somewhere  
That I could call a home  
I'd live without a care  
I'd never be alone  
One day I will get there  
I feel it in my bones  
I check upon the scores  
I listen to The Coors  
Behind closed doors  
  
Behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors  
They still want more  
Behind closed doors
