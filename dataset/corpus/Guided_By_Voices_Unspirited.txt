Even when you're lifted by the lie  
Heaven sent and gifted-ask them why  
Never give it all up-never try  
All their hearts are breaking  
Unspirited  
The less than life you live  
The lessons make you lame, boy  
The same, boy  
Everywhere that you go, I'm with you now  
When you lose it all, you'll think of me  
When you take the fall, you'll drink to me  
I'm the one who did it painlessly  
I'm the one that does it  
Unspirited
