Ugly children with poor complexions and greasy hair  
Receive no concessions and it's a heartless world  
And it's a thoughtless heartless world  
Oh james oh you're a terrible child  
Hide yourself away from furnished accommodation  
With a view and window seat  
You swear she really is the best thing that you have ever seen  
But your heart is in the wrong place  
Cover your face and despair yourself away  
Oh you're impossible james hide yourself away  
And it's a sin to be a saint  
And you're impossible james  
And it's impossible to accept that she's impossible  
And as a consequence you lock yourself away  
And it's a crime to be alive and be alone  
And be content to be  
Oh james oh you're a terrible child  
Hide yourself away  
And in the morning when you wake  
Nothing will have changed
