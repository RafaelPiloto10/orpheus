Hangin' out with Lars down on 6th street he knew that I was in trouble  
I was feeling much like the devil  
There was something burnin' deep inside of me  
Ran into three Puerto Ricans these girls took us to the fun house  
Where we played a lonely pinball machine  
Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  
I'm having a hard time understanding, it gets all too demanding  
She's all gone and I'm stranded  
Something burning deep inside of me  
All I know it's 4'o'clock and she ain't never showed up  
And I watched a thousand people go home from work, yeah  
Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  
How many times will it take me before I go crazy?  
Before I lose everything?  
Something burning deep inside of me  
Ran into three Puerto Ricans those girls took us to the fun house  
I don't wanna be alone again  
Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia
