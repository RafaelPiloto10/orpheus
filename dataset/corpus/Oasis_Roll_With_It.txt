You gotta roll with it  
You gotta take your time  
You gotta say what you say  
Don't let anybody get in your way  
'Cause it's all too much  
For me to take  
  
Don't ever stand aside  
Don't ever be denied  
You ought to be who you be  
If you're coming with me  
  
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside  
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide  
I'm thinking things that I just can't abide  
I know the roads on which your life will drive  
  
I find the key that lets you slip inside  
Kiss the girl she's not behind the door  
Do you know I think I recognize your face  
But I've never seen you before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know the roads on which your life will drive  
I find the key that lets you slip inside  
Kiss the girl she's not behind the door  
Do you know I think I recognize your face  
But I've never seen you before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't ever stand aside  
Don't ever be denied  
You ought to be who you be  
If you're coming with me  
  
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside [Repeat: x 8]
