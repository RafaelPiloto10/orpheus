From the Golden seat of Ramses to the ending of the sacred Nile  
The pharaohs of this ancient land the deserts cross countless miles  
Inside the labyrinth where buried is the king his waiting maids countless
gifts lie within  
Mumified entombed the ancient scroll left to rot brain heart and soul  
As they walk through the passages of endless night using sparsely the candles
as their only light  
Living only on the storages of food they brought no escape live to die becomes
their only thought  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tutankhamun  
Cursed where this grave is their only thing Kking Tutankhamun  
As the years begin to close and food to nourish sparse insanity starts to
reign to flourish in the dark  
As they walk through the passages of endless time using sparsely the candles
as their only light  
Living only on the storages of food they brought no escape live to die becomes
their only thought  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tutankhamun  
Cursed where this grave is their only thing king Tutankhamun  
And as they walk through the passages of endless night  
Drawing nearer to the last nothing left inside the tomb  
Except the braindead plight lost in histories of the past  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tuankhamun  
Cursed where his grave is the only thing king Tutankhamun  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king buried deep inside the pyramid  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king buried deep inside the pyramid
