Well, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
But don't fence me in  
Let me ride through that wide open country that i love  
Don't fence me in  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but i ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon till i lose my senses  
I don't like hobbles and i can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, don't you fence me in
