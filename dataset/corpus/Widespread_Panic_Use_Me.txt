My friends  
Feel its their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me  
All you want to do is use me  
Oh, but my answer  
To all that use me stuff  
I want to spread the news  
That if it feels this good getting used  
You just keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
My brother  
He sat me right down and he talked to me  
Oh, he told me  
That I ought to not let you just walk on me  
And I'm sure he meant well  
Yeah, but when our talk was through  
I said brother if you only knew  
You'd wish that you were in my shoes  
You just keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Oh, sometimes  
Yeah, it's true you really do abuse me  
You get me in a crowd of high class people  
And then you act real rude to me  
But, oh, baby, baby, baby  
When you love me I can't get enough!  
I want to spread the news  
That if it feels this good getting used  
Oh, you just keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
Talking about you using me  
It all depends on what you do  
It ain't too bad the way you're using me  
'Cause I sure am using you do to the things you do
