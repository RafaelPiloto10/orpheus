I feel your hearts-tune  
I feel the sound move  
I hear the last tune  
Over and over again  
Without end  
I feel the flowers  
I feel the showers  
I hear the last words  
Over and over again  
Without end  
  
I'll be your lucky guy  
I'll be your lucky guy  
Tomorrow when all things are shaping  
Tomorrow then I'll be with you  
Tomorrow when you're heart is aching  
I keep on loving you  
  
I feel the magic  
There's no tragic  
I hear your laughing  
Over and over again  
Without end  
I see you walking  
I hear you talking  
I feel the loving  
Over and over again  
Without end
