I've always said that one's enough to love  
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough  
Something tells me you're not satisfied  
You got plans to make me one of four or five  
  
I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood  
But you won't catch me carving up my love  
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit  
If it takes more than me let's call it quits  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I don't want to go on with you like that  
Don't want to be a feather in your cap  
I just want to tell you honey I ain't mad  
But I don't want to go on with you like that  
  
It gets so hard sometimes to understand  
This vicious circle's getting out of hand  
Don't need an extra eye to see  
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No I don't want to go on with you like that  
One more set of boots on your welcome mat  
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back  
cause I don't want to go on with you like that  
  
Oh if you want to spread it around sister that's just fine  
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines  
If you want to hold someone in the middle of the night  
Call out the guards, turn out the light
