E-E-E-Excuse me, but who are you fixin' to be  
Let them motherfuckers know it's plenty fish in the sea  
And he sweatin me just cuz I got that tightest hole  
But I couldn't find that th-thang with a microscope  
Give me dom dom da da da da da dom dom dom  
I ain't trippin on yo money, money long long long  
Want my own tv production company  
So tell harpo to hit me Celie  
Anyway, ri-ri, what rhymes with your name freely  
Money got you vacationing in Chili  
Do you want to sit on the back while I wheelie  
Really, really, no for real really  
Laid out on the beach, they be feedin me my catfishes  
Cuz it's raining men, Fat bitches
