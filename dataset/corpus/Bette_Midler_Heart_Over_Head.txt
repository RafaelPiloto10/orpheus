I had a will of iron  
I had a heart of steel  
I always call the shots  
But, honey, you shoot to kill  
I've spent a hundred other nights like this  
A little laughter and a stranger's kiss  
  
But the next thing that I knew  
I was heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
It's too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
  
I never once imagined  
A night like this before  
That love would last for hours  
And still I begged for more  
If I sound a little crazy  
Well, forgive me, please  
My head is swimmin'  
And I'm on my knees  
  
Cryin', "Love me, love me, do!"  
Because I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
  
Can't seem to slow down  
Can't even touch the ground  
The harder I try  
The higher I fly  
  
I'm fallin' heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Where did you get your touch?  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
I like it much too much  
Heart over head  
Over heart over head over you  
Too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head  
Over heart over head over you...
