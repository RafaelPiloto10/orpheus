I'm in such a mood  
Turned on by the thought of you  
You're not around  
So I just sit here and brood  
Amongst a lethal combination  
Kind of midnight mood sedation  
I miss you  
But that's another kind of silence  
Sittin' by the fire  
Stare into the flames  
Without you I'm as lonely as the night train  
  
Chorus  
And Miles is blowin cool through the room  
I wish that I could be there with you  
Was it the strike of two  
Or the sound of his blues  
You're going to my head  
And Miles is blowin' through the room  
  
Gypsy music for lonely hearts  
Takes care of me while we're apart  
If you were here  
I'd be dancing with you  
How long must you keep me waiting  
Can't you see the toll it's taking  
I need you  
But that's another kind of maddness  
Now I'm almost through  
A solo bottle of champagne  
And I'm half way through  
Sketches of Spain  
  
Chorus  
And Miles is blowin cool through the room  
I wish that I could be there with you  
Was it the strike of two  
Or the sound of his blues  
You're going to my head  
And Miles is blowin' through the room
