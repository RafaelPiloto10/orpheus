You said you loved me  
And then you left  
You broke every promise  
You win every bet  
  
[Chorus]  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
So tell me tell me  
Whatcha gonna do  
When your well runs dry  
  
Listen to me darlin'  
You cheat and you lie  
Now you come a runnin  
Runnin, wanting second try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sat down and sighed  
And I heard you packin'  
I watched you pass by me  
But you said nothin'  
Not one single word but I know  
You're gonna miss me  
And you're gonna be blue  
  
[Chorus]
