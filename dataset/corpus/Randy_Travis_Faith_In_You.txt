I don't have faith in technology,  
Even though we created it.  
All this stuff just breaks down anyway,  
And you can never get it fixed.  
But I do have faith in you.  
  
I don't have faith in politics,  
But I do believe in the will of the people.  
I don't know much about big time religion  
But I believe in the cross on the steeple.  
And I do have faith in you.  
  
[Bridge:]  
And after all this time the lie becomes the truth  
We traded in our innocence and sacrificed our youth.  
But you give me your love the one thing I can't lose  
You believe in me,  
And I still have faith in you.  
  
[Interlude:]  
  
The more I search for my significance,  
Seems the more I disappear.  
And I wonder, have I made a difference in anybody's life  
Since I've been here.  
And I can hear your laughter it's the sweetest sound I've ever known.  
I don't know how love happens,  
But I know I'm not alone.  
And I do have faith in you.  
  
[Bridge:]  
And after all this time sometimes I see the truth  
And I'm touched by your innocence and  
Now I'm not confused.  
You give my your love, the one thing I can't lose.  
You believe in me,  
And I still have faith in...  
I do have faith in you.
