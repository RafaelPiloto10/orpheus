He could word it out like a dangerous man  
How could you value his intentions?  
Martin had the devil just like anyone can  
He spoke words they were frightened to mention  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yesterday ain't gone  
We just pushed it aside  
Out in the jungle  
There ain't nowhere you can hide  
There's a different smile on your face today  
Though you wear it well there's a lot to say  
There's a different mood in the world tonight  
If we can do it good we can do it right  
  
John he washed it over with a confidence tan  
I know peace and love ain't prevention  
Brian in the closet with his master-plan  
Build them up its so sad they forget you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Are we not men, did you save us?  
Are we not men, did you try, did you try?  
  
We have been [Repeat: x3]  
We have been denied  
  
I could word it out like a dangerous man  
If they landed here we'd collect them  
Yellow, black or white here in the circus of man  
I don't know, I don't care, I forget you  
  
[Chorus]
