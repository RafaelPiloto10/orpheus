Only the wind sang the words he could hear  
Born of the sand washed ashore on a tear  
Time wrote the lines on his face like a scroll  
Love is a loss to the man with no soul  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Run through the darkness he hears - turn back  
There's no survivors, you can't turn back  
Dreams keep him turning back the years  
  
Raising his sail cast away on his own  
Motherless child on a sea all alone  
Morpheus calls but they won't lay him down  
Creatures of midnight appear with no sound  
  
Run through the darkness, turn back the years, turn back the years
