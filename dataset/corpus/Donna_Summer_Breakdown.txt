Breakdown, shakedown again  
Breakdown, over you  
Breakdown, way down again  
Breakdown, over you, over you  
  
Just when our love appeared to be  
Growing strong  
And just when you believed that  
We both belonged  
You catch me out a cheating and  
Foolin' 'round  
You find that I'm lyin'  
I feel like I'm dyin'  
Here I come cryin' again  
  
Breakdown, shakedown again  
Breakdown, over you  
Breakdown, way down again  
Breakdown, over you, over you  
  
I put you through this whole  
Affair before  
I broke it up, you broke it up even more  
Then I begged you to patch it all  
Up again  
Why did you listen to me  
You should have let it all be  
You shouldn't put all your trust me  
  
Breakdown, shakedown again  
Breakdown, over you  
Breakdown, way down again  
Breakdown, over you, over you  
  
Breakdown, let down again  
Breakdown, over you  
Breakdown, straight down again  
Breakdown, over you, over you
