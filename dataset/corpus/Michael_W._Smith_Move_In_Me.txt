I am only human  
Struggling to find  
Confidence in all that I believe  
You are only holy  
You are love defined  
And you have said to ask and I'll receive  
So I have come to pray  
That you will come and fill  
The hunger here inside me to grow  
Stronger in the faith  
There's a longing and a need  
To have you ever closer  
Come fill me  
Cause when you move in me  
It's like a symphony  
The timeless melody  
That soothes my soul  
Though silent I can tell  
That you're alive and well  
Cause I can feel you move  
In me  
What they try to tell me  
Is that your love is falseWhat they try to tell me  
Is that Your is false  
And faith is just a way  
I choose to feel  
And that there was no meaning  
To You upon the cross  
And I should reach for something that is real  
And when those words are said  
The questions in me start  
And I don't have any answers  
Until I stop thinking with my head  
And start listening to my heart  
And there I find my assurance  
I tell them  
Chorus
