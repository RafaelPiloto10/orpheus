I go out to work on Monday morning  
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon  
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down,  
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon  
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening  
Thursday I go waltzing to the zoo  
I come from London Town, I'm just an ordinary guy  
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre  
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night  
(There he goes again)  
I'll be lazing on a Sunday  
Lazing on a Sunday  
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon
