Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm,  
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.  
  
Wake up, wake up, the sun is saying,  
I know you're still in dream land,  
But just come back.  
I know you're afraid of me and the days of the world,  
But open your eyes and you'll see that I'm shining for you.  
  
Wake up, wake up, the sky is up telling,  
Today is the first day of the rest of your life.  
I know you're afraid of me and the best of the world,  
Open your eyes and you'll see that I'm smiling for you.  
  
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm,  
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm  
  
Wake up, wake up, the bird is up singing,  
I know the good times that are coming your way.  
I know you're afraid of me and the love of the world,  
Open your eyes and you'll see that I'm singing for you.
