(Hook: Takeoff)  
Two cups filled up with easter pink  
Take a minute, rest in peace, to pimp C  
Double G, Louis V all over me  
Take a minute, rest in peace, og Dee  
Two cups filled up with easter pink  
Take a minute, R.I.P, to pimp C  
Double G, Louis V all over me  
Take a minute, R.I.P, og Dee  
  
(Verse 1: Takeoff)  
Two cups filled up with actavis  
Damn! Rest in peace, to pimp C  
Louis V all over me I'm living luxury  
Take a minute, rest in peace, og Dee  
I remember the last time when double talked to me  
Told me y'all the hottest niggas in the street  
He told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry  
These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency  
So I go buy a pint of lean  
I'm thinking bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me  
I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me  
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!

[Verse 2: Quavo)  
Lost my daddy, young nigga I was only four  
Damn! Now I gotta pour a four  
Got my momma on my back, she really love me though  
Taking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door  
I understand I have committed a sin  
Double Dee said keep going hard on these fuck niggas, gotta know we 'gon win  
So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible  
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle  
Never know when it's your last supper nigga, so you gotta keep you some
disciples, gone!
