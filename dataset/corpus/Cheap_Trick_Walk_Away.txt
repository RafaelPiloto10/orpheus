You think that it's funny  
You think I'm a fool  
It's nothin' I needed  
Just somethin' to do  
Out of touch out of time  
It's not easy to find, well  
These two hearts are  
Broken before they start, so  
  
[Chorus]  
Walk away walk away  
I don't mind I don't mind  
Don't act like you're worried  
I'm feelin' no pain  
You got what you needed  
Your fun little game  
  
Stoned and confused  
I know  
It ain't easy  
To hold on  
We've been hidin'  
Pretendin' cheatin' and lyin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Don't know what to thank  
Who to blame  
We were lovers just the same, well  
Startin' stoppin'  
Over and over and over  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Walk away walk away
