One, two, three baby don't think twice  
Just like that you gotta brand new life  
Hop in this truck and run through the red lights  
  
Yeah where you wanna go, baby name the town  
We can go up north or head down south  
Roll down the windows with the radio loud  
  
Come on turn it up, yeah  
Start living your life  
On the double, leave your troubles behind  
You knew we're gonna be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
You could be a black bird  
On a country street  
Hiding from the world with a broken wing  
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me  
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans  
Scared of the rain just scared to sing  
But you better believe, you're gonna fly with me  
  
Well, here we are baby in the back of my van  
Sun's going down sky's turning red  
Stars coming out  
Baby look at you now  
  
God know how long but its been a while  
Since I heard you laugh and I'd seen that smile  
Felt that kiss and I can get use to this  
Baby I could get use to this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're gonna fly  
You're gonna fly  
  
You could be a black bird  
On a country street  
Hiding from the world with a broken wing  
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me  
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans  
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing  
But you better believe yeah you better believe oh baby  
  
You could be a black bird  
On a country street  
Hiding from the world with a broken wing  
But you better believe, you gonna fly with me  
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans  
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing  
But you better believe you're gonna fly with me  
  
You're gonna fly  
You're gonna fly with me baby  
You better believe my honey girl  
Ooh yeah, you're goin' to fly
