I saw you there last night  
In the latest place  
You were taking in the scenery  
Hungry for a new face  
Seems what I said to you  
Didn't change your mind  
You could open your eyes, realise  
You don't need anyone  
Who's always on the phone  
You don't need anyone  
Who won't leave you alone  
You don't need anyone  
Who'd want you to cut him a key  
You don't need anyone  
  
Out on the streets today  
In the clothes you bought  
And your glossy picture pages  
Full of other people's thoughts  
Will you just wander along  
Live your life this way  
'Till some magazine shows you what to do  
  
You don't need anyone  
Who's always on the phone  
You don't need anyone  
Who won't leave you alone  
To fill up the holes in your life  
To tell you what you're needing  
And make you do what you don't like  
  
You don't need anyone  
To show you where to go  
And turn you into somebody  
You wouldn't even want to know  
You don't need anyone  
As far as I can see  
You don't need anyone  
But Me
