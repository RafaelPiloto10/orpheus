In a sentimental mood, I can see the stars come thru my room  
While your loving attitude, is like a flame that lights the gloom  
  
On the wings of every kiss, drifts a melody so strange and sweet  
In this sentimental bliss, you make my paradise complete  
  
Rose petals seem to fall, it's all I could dream to call you mine  
My heart's a lighter thing, since U made this night a thing divine  
  
In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly  
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me  
  
In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly  
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me
