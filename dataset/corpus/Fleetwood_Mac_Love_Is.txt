Do you know what this is  
No I don't  
But whatever it is  
It's very powerful  
Have you felt this way before  
Oh, I thought I knew  
Do you know that I love you now  
Oh yes I do  
  
Love is  
You've got the softest lips  
You know that I cannot stay  
Yes, I know  
It has nothing to do with you  
Or with love  
Oh yes it does  
  
Do not call or come around here  
Do not tell  
You know that I loved you then.. Oh well  
  
Love is  
You've got the softest lips  
Love is  
The touch of your fingertips  
Love is  
Knowing you won't let go  
  
She awakens things  
That he said he thought were dead  
He says are you happy now  
Oh, yes I am  
But when it's over  
How then will you feel  
Will you miss those arms  
That used to go around you.  
  
So she stood in the hallway frozen  
In the dark  
And her heart broke down  
She cried  
She fell to the floor  
One tear... Slid across her lip  
To the corner of her mouth  
Love is  
And dropped... To the floor  
  
Love is  
You've got the softest lips  
Love is  
The touch of your fingertips  
Ooh she says, love is  
Knowing you won't let go  
Love is  
Watching you go  
You're so very powerful  
Love is  
Am I happy  
Yes I am  
  
Do I know you love me now  
Yes I do  
Do I know you cannot stay  
I know  
All about love  
All about love  
Love is  
You're so very powerful
