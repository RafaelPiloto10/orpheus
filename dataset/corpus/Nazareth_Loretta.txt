Lovely Loretta  
I'd like to know you better

Goin' on in your head  
Sweet juicy Lucy go crazy if you chose me  
Sure would like to help you  
Stop fallin' out'a your bed  
Lovely Loretta you know I'm scared to bet ya

Stronger tha whiskey, ya got to be a Frisky  
But ya got something I'd really, like to use  
  
Lovely Loretta

Helps to make my dreams reality

You know that its only a simple matter of time  
Save my sanity,Oh , girl you gotta use me  
Loretta come and help me stop goin' out'a my mind  
Loretta come and help me stop goin' out'a my mind  
Lovely Loretta
