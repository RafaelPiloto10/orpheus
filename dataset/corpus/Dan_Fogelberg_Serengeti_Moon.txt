The grass is high and the work is done  
Send the sun to his sleeping place  
Now we'll dance and make love  
Beneath the serengeti moon  
The gods are laughing their twinkling eyes  
Shine on us in the clear night sky  
Take my hand, let us walk  
Beneath the serengeti moon  
Oh, let the music play  
"listen to the melody" mamalang melodia yalla  
Fill your heart with joy and mirth  
"let your hearts rejoice" thabishing pelo tsa lona  
Oh, let the rain clouds come  
"listen to the melody" mameland melodie yalla  
Spill their life upon this earth  
Oh, let the music play  
"listen to the melody" mamalang melodia yalla  
Fill your heart with joy and mirth  
"let your hearts rejoice" thabishing pelo tsa lona  
Oh, let the rain clouds come  
"listen to the melody" mameland melodie yalla  
Spill their life upon this earth  
The grass is high and the work is done  
Send the sun to his sleeping place  
Now we'll dance and make love beneath  
The serengeti moon  
The serengeti moon  
The serengeti moon
