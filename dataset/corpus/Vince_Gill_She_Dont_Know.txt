Only a memory this morning  
My baby up and walked away  
In my heart the tears keep pouring  
She left with so much more to say  
  
[Chorus]  
She don't know whose heart she's breaking  
She don't know my dream lies still  
She don't know how much she's taking  
She don't know and never will  
  
I can't sleep, I've gotta find her  
I've got to make her understand  
Although another love may bind her  
No one can love her like I can  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
She don't know (she don't know)  
She don't know (she don't know)  
She don't know (she don't know)
