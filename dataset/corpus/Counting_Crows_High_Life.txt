All my friends got flowers in their eyes  
But I got none this season  
All of last years blooms have gone and died  
Time doesn't give a reason  
Hey baby, do you ask yourself sometimes  
What you need to be forgiven?  
Everything that you've ever done wrong  
Is the reason that I'm driven  
Straight to you  
  
Waiting here for you  
Wanting to tell you  
How I get my ends and my beginnings mixed up too  
Just the way you do  
Thought if I told you  
You might want to stay for just another day or two  
  
Waiting for the trains that just never come  
Beginning to believe in  
the disappearing nature of the people we have been  
We have begun to change into the worst kind of people  
So unkind  
Oh apologies, no apologies, this apology  
Doesn't describe the way it feels to feel for you  
  
Waiting here for you  
Wanting to tell you  
How I find myself slowly disappearing too  
Just the way you do  
Thought if I told you  
You might want to help me to remain with you  
  
I just wanna stay for a little while  
I wanna stay for a little while  
  
There's a night life falling down on me  
I just feel like a change  
Beneath the sun in the summer,  
a sea of flowers won't bloom without the rain  
But oh, this desert life, this high life  
Here at the dying end of the day  
I wasn't made for this scene baby  
But I was made in this scene  
And baby it's just my way  
I don't wanna go home alone, I wanna come on home to you  
  
Waiting here for you  
Wanting to tell you  
How I line my sky with all the silver I can use  
Just the way you do  
Thought if I told you  
You might want to stay for just another day or two
