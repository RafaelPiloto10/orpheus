This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
President Dead is clueless  
And he's caught in a head-lock, police state god  
And his skull is stained glass  
Incubated and jet set  
The bitter thinkers buy their tickets  
To go find god like a piggy in a fair  
  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
This is for the people, they want you  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
Give the pills time to work  
We all can't be martyred in the  
Winter of your discontent  
Getting high on violence, baby  
Every night we are nailed into place and  
Every night we just can't seem to  
Ever remember the reason why  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
And we don't want to live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
This is for the people, they want to  
This is for the people, they want to  
This is for the people, they want to  
Getting high on violence, baby  
  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better  
And we don't want to live live forever  
And we know that suffering is so much better
