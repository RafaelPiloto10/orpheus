Talk about love, talk about trust  
Talkin' 'bout forever baby  
When I'm talkin' 'bout us  
  
I give you my word, stick to my guns  
Believe me when I tell ya baby  
That we've just begun  
  
You don't understand, no  
The full intent of my plan  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be your soul provider  
I want to stay that way  
For the longest time  
I want to be, your sould provider  
Justsay you'll let me  
And darlin' I will  
  
I know you've been hurt, I know you're love shy  
You don't have to say it baby  
It's gonna take some time  
Ya got my heart, in the palm of your hand  
Swear it's gonna stay there baby  
Give me half a chance  
  
You don't understand  
The full intent of my plan  
  
I've been waitin' for a long time for somebody like you  
To give my love, all my love day and night  
Just say you'll be mine for the rest of your life  
Baby I'll show you why  
  
[Chorus]
