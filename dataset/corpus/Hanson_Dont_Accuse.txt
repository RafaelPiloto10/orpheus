Don't accuse  
Hanson  
There was a boy, he was lame  
He had a limp in his leg  
People looked at him with a frown  
He said why do you put me down  
No no no no don't accuse  
You don't know what they've been through  
No no no no don't accuse  
You don't know what they've been through  
How would you like it if I hurt you  
Way deep inside  
And looked at you with a frown  
Would you feel all alone  
No one comes over to help you  
It seems like nobody cares  
Maybe next time you'll think twice  
Before you accuse or compare  
(repeat chorus)  
When you prick us do we not bleed  
When you whip us do we not weep  
When you hurt us do we not cry  
When you stab us do we not die  
(repeat chorus 4x)
