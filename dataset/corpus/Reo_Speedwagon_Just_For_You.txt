This is just for you  
I dedicate everything I do  
My fear is gone  
And I feel so strong  
Love has never been so true  
I've never seen what I see in you  
I watch you sleep  
Your beauty runs so deep  
And wherever you go, I'll walk beside you  
And whatever you need, I will provide you  
Take my soul, and never let go  
  
Cause I live just for you  
And I give just for you  
And your love has me wanting to  
Be the best man I can be  
I believe in forever  
Just for you and me  
  
This is just for us  
To a future filled with truth and trust  
And your sweet touch  
I want you so much  
And there is nothing that we can't do together  
I am gonna be lovin' you forever  
Take my hand, and make me your man  
  
Cause I live just for you  
And I give just for you  
And your love has me wanting to  
Be the best man I can be  
I believe in forever  
Just for you and me  
  
Take my soul, and never let go  
Cause I live just for you  
And I give just for you  
And your love has me wanting to  
Be the best man I can be  
And I believe in forever  
Just for you and me  
  
And I believe in forever  
Just for you and me
