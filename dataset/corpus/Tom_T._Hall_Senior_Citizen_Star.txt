On the floor of the limo there's a bottle of whiskey  
A white Stetson hat with a fine feather band  
His face covered up with the two day old paper  
He's a songwriter legend that grey haired old man  
They don't say much to him he don't say much to them  
They wonder what goes on inside his old head  
Sometimes when they shake him tryin' to wake him  
He comes round so slowly they think that he's dead  
And you're not allowed to talk about Denver Colorado  
You're not allowed to talk about his first wife Joanne  
You're not allowed to talk about his first fiddle player  
Or anybody who ever worked in Elvis's band  
He motions the driver to get him some coffee  
He sits there and sips it his eyes on the floor  
When he's readin' his paper he sometimes looks angry  
He's still tryin' to figure out the Second World War  
He mentions Chicago the Opry and Wheeling  
His awards are all stacked in the box in his barn  
He made millions of dollars with a hoop and a holler  
Now he lives in a trailer on a five acre farm  
And you're not allowed to talk about...  
As the limo rolls on down the America's highways  
Just frames to the sign on the side of his car  
It says pickin' and singin' for any occasion the songwrittin' senior citizen
star
