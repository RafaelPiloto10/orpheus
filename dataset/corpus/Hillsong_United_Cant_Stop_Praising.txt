Can't Stop Praising  
Words and Music by Tulele Faletolu and Marty Sampson  
  
Try to find the words  
To express the way you are  
But the beauty of the lord  
Cannot be described in just one lifetime  
  
Look at the sun over the seas  
Look at your grace that covers me  
Now I know  
Yes I know  
Now I know  
I know your love has saved me  
  
In the morning  
I can't stop praising your name  
In the evening  
I can't stop praising your name  
In the morning  
I can't stop praising your name  
In the evening  
I can't stop  
  
And I want you to know  
Yes I want you to know  
Oh yes I  
  
Lord you're so amazing  
Every word you say is true  
Better than the finest treausre  
So glad that I found you  
  
You held me close  
When I was down  
Your world has turned my world around  
Now I know  
Yes I know  
Now I know  
I know how much I love you  
  
Hallelujah  
We praise your name  
We praise your name
