On every corner of every avenue  
The word's been passed all around  
Better watch out, lock up your daughters  
'Cause that bad Frankie lee is back in town  
All the ladies fall for Frankie  
Sayin', Frankie Lee, how can it be  
Of all the men here, you're the only one  
Who's got the key, to set us free  
Oh, Frankie Lee  
Now there's a woman, in this neighborhood  
Who's loving Frankie in her mind  
But in fear of bein' discovered  
She keeps her secret locked up inside  
Just then a stone's thrown up at the window  
And she looks below, what does she see  
There's a man there, standing 'neath the streetlight  
It looks to be  
Like Frankie Lee  
You'd best believe  
Well, old Frankie steals through the back door  
While her old man is leavin' by the hall  
But before she hears his footsteps  
Frankie's standing at the bedroom door  
So she holds him, then she begs him  
Oh Frankie Lee, don't 'cha ever leave  
And he tells her, she's the only one  
He's got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set her free  
Then as the moon fades, into the night sky  
Frankie leaves while she's asleep  
Then he's up and out on the street again  
He's got the key that'll set you free  
That Frankie Lee  
Every kid in this ol' gang town  
They'd want to be like Frankie Lee  
Please the ladies, like a vagabond  
He's got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set them free  
Yeah, every kid in this ol' gang town  
Yeah, they'd want to be like Frankie Lee  
Casanova and Valentino  
They'd like to be as good as Frankie lee  
Every kid in this ol' gang town  
They'd like to be like Frankie Lee  
Please the ladies, like a vagabond  
He's got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set them free
