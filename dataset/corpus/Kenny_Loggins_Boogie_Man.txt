Well, there hasn't been a party on a Saturday night  
When the music starts rollin' and the feelin' is right  
Some joker in the back screams loud as he can  
Boogie is the message that he sends to the band  
So if you really want to boogie  
You better begin by getting up on your feet  
  
And boogie, boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Well, if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me, baby, tonight  
  
There was a time when boogie was the law of the land  
And everybody'd boogie from New York to Japan  
Even little babies sing before they can speak  
To do the boogie woogie just by putting the beat  
So if you really want to boogie  
You better begin by getting up on your feet  
  
And boogie, boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Well, if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me, baby, tonight  
  
Well, boogie, boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
I said, "Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie"  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
  
Do you really want to boogie?  
Yes, I would really like to woogie  
Well, if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me, baby, tonight  
I'm gonna do your little boogie tonight
