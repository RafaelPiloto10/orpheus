I see you now  
Oh fill me now  
I feel it's coming down  
My voice cries out  
And I only hope  
That you're the one my voice will fall upon  
I play my cards  
But it's by the grace of love  
That I play my cards at all  
Come fill me up  
Oh fill me now when I'm empty  
When I'm all dried out  
Rain, rain, rain down on me  
Again and again  
Rain down on me  
Oh I see you now  
I see them all, see them all  
They line up to drink the blood  
I see it now  
I believe the devil  
And the lord have been dancing all along  
...  
Rain, rain, rain down on me  
Again and again  
Rain down on me  
I feel it now  
I see you standing there like an angel  
That fell down from above  
I see you now  
I don't believe that anything  
But a billion years could make you what you are  
...  
Rain, rain, rain down on me  
Again and again  
Rain down on me  
Rain, rain, rain down on me
