Everybody said so man you could see it on T.V.  
They stood there ashamed with nowhere to go  
Nobody wants them now the kids are alright  
Every day is a holiday and pushin' people around  
  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
  
Someone caught one I could see so myself  
I had to call 254 so they wouldn't blame me  
We wanted to know how much trouble there was  
When we asked our daddy he said it's just because  
  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
  
I don't want to open a can of worms and  
I don't want any Spagetti-Os  
And I could always tell when  
Someone is holding a grudge  
  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends  
I'm making monsters for my friends
