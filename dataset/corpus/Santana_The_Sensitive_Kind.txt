Don't take her for granted,  
She had a hard time  
Don't misunderstand her  
Or play with her mind  
Treat her so gently,  
It will pay you in time  
You've gotta know  
She's the sensitive kind  
  
Tell her you love her each and every night  
You will discover she will treat you right  
If you believe, I know you will find  
There ain't nothin' like the sensitive kind  
  
She gets so lonely waitin' for you  
You are the only thing to help her through  
Don't take her for granted  
She has a hard time  
You got to know she's the sensitive kind  
You got to know she's the sensitive kind
