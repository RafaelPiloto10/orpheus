Pulse's racing, darling,  
How grand we are.  
Little by little we meet in the middle.  
There's danger in the dark.  
  
It oughta be illegal  
Make it a crime to be out in the cold.  
It oughta be illegal  
You got a reason for living.  
You battle on with the love you're living on.  
  
You gotta be mine.  
We take it away.  
It's gotta be night and day,  
Just a matter of time.  
  
And we got nothing to be guilty of.  
Our love, will climb and mountain  
Near or far, we are,  
And we never let it end.  
  
And we got nothing to be sorry for.  
Our love, is one in a million.  
Eyes can see, that we  
Got a highway to the sky.  
  
Don't want to hear goodbye.  
Don't want to hear goodbye.  
I don't want to hear your  
  
And we got and we got nothing to be guilty of.  
Our love, will climb and mountain  
Near or far, we are,  
And we never let it end.  
  
And we got nothing to be sorry for.  
Our love is one in a million.  
Eyes can see, that we  
Got a highway to the sky.  
Don't want to hear, goodbye.  
Don't want to hear, goodbye  
I don't want to hear your  
  
And we got nothing
