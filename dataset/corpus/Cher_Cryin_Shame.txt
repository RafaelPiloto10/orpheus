Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Im Readin your letter  
I don't know weather  
To call you up and talk again.  
When i saw the name you signed  
Goin through my mind it was a memory  
Of way back when.  
  
Now All That I can tell you is good luck baby  
Im sorry that it couldnt be me,  
Cause it felt to right and if we held on tight  
Id be with you tonight.  
  
We never should have let our  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
I wont forget the summer  
My heart was like a drummer  
Just beating every night away  
Walkin in the sun with you  
Baby we were one i knew  
Love was really ours to stay  
  
Now all that i have left is a faded picture,  
You belong to her today  
And the memory of you and me  
Is just a used to be,  
  
We never should have let our  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
Shame it don't happen  
  
Love slipped through my hands  
Its a cryin shame  
I can't play in your band  
Love fell at my feet it's a cryin shame  
The bitter is in the sweet  
  
Oh no..oh no  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It don't happen no more
