Once I was young --  
Yesterday, perhaps --  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps.  
  
Once I was young,  
But never was naive.  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve.  
  
And now I know I was naive.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what day it was  
You held my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
  
And I'll say it was grand.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,  
  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what year it was  
Life was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what year it was  
  
Life was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
  
And I know what time it is now.
