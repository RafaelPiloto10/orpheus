Miss Lonely Hearts, please lend a hand  
My one and only love is with another man  
Can you tell me why my baby said goodbye?  
She didn't even try  
Miss Lonely Hearts  
  
Miss Lonely Hearts, What can I do?  
Oh how it hurts to know  
The one you love's untrue  
Will you hear my plea? Oh what can it be?  
Why can't we both agree  
Miss Lonely Hearts  
  
You've helped so many find their way  
Just give the word and I'll obey  
  
Miss Lonely Hearts, what can I do?  
Oh how it hurts to know  
The one you love's untrue  
Will you hear my plea? Oh what can it be?  
Why can't we both agree  
Miss Lonely Hearts
