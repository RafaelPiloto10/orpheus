I am William Wallace  
My life was a mystery  
Some say born twelve seven two  
Some say twelve sixty three  
  
Was dubbed Malcolm of Paisley  
Maybe Alan from Aire  
Did I have a wife or no?  
Do you really care?  
  
They say I had a big, red beard  
But all you need to know  
I was a Scottish rebel  
And the English were my foe  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
This is war I cried!  
Many English fought me  
And many English died!  
  
I took against the English  
Back when I was fairly wee  
'Cause an Englishman called Selby  
Bullied my whole family  
It upset me, so I struck him dead  
Well, wouldn't you?  
Then an English sheriff came along  
Guess what, I killed him too!  
  
They say he killed my wife  
So he deserved what he got  
Then England's King Ed came for me  
Ooh, I'm scared! Not!  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
Possibly six feet seven  
But all that really matters is  
I sent Englishmen to heaven!  
  
Forty thousand English came  
To Stirling Bridge for me  
They had to cross a narrow bridge  
To get to us, you see  
We held them off, pushed them back  
It was no contest  
Bridge collapsed, hundreds drowned  
Of course I killed the rest!  
  
I celebrated Stirling Bridge  
Another Scottish win  
By decorating my sword  
With the English general's skin  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
Scottish legend too  
Fought for Scottish freedom  
Was a hero through and through  
  
Here's where my rebel story comes unstuck  
At Falkirk defeated, I'd run out of luck  
Spent seven years playing hide and seek  
Captured, sent to London, tried for treason  
What a cheek!  
  
King Ed hanged me, then a lovely touch  
Pulled my guts out, guess he didn't like me much!  
  
William Wallace, Scottish rebel!  
In Scotland my heart lived  
Though sadly, my head wound up  
On a spike on London Bridge!  
  
Ooh, that smarts!
