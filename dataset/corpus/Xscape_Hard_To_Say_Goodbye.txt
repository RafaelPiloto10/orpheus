Time has been short since you left me,  
So I can't help but think,  
Of how things between us used to be.  
You were a piece of my heart,  
And I thought we were swell,  
Until you told me you were leaving,  
To find a better life for yourself.  
Oh I...  
  
I wish we were together again,  
Loving the way we used to love,  
Boy I miss you much.  
I wish we were together again,  
Oh how I'm missing you,  
It's so hard for me to say goodbye.  
  
You know that I love you,  
And for you there ain't nothing in this world,  
That I won't do.  
If you would only come back to me,  
And let me show you how loving me could be.  
  
I, I've got feelings,  
But you act like you don't care,  
You treat me so unfair.  
  
Love has no meaning,  
Since you walked right out my life.  
You've touched a part of me,  
Can't you see that I'm in need of you?  
  
I wish we were together again,  
Loving the way we used to love,  
Boy I miss you much.  
I wish we were together again,  
Oh how I'm missing you,  
It's so hard for me to say goodbye.  
  
I wish we were together again,  
Loving the way we used to love,  
Boy I miss you much.  
I wish we were together again,  
Oh how I'm missing you,  
It's so hard for me to say goodbye.
