Beggers:  
Look down and see the beggers at your feet  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down and see the sweepings of the street  
Look down, look down, upon your fello man  
  
Gavroche:  
How do you do my name's Gavroche!  
These are my people, here's my patch!  
Not much to look at nothing posh!  
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch  
This is my school my high society  
Here in the slums of San Michelle  
We live off crumbs of humble piety  
Tough on the teeth - but what the hell!  
Think your poor? Think your free?  
Follow me! Follow me!  
  
Beggers:  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man  
  
Enjolras:  
Where are the leaders of the land?  
Where are the swells who run the show?  
  
Marius:  
Only one man and that's Lamarque  
Speaks for the people here to go  
  
Beggers:  
See our children fed  
Help us in our shame  
Something for a crust of bread in Holy Jesus Name  
In the Lord's Holy Name  
In His Name  
In His Name  
In His Name  
  
Marius:  
Lamarque is ill and fading fast  
Won't last a week out so they say!  
  
Enjolras:  
With all the anger in the land  
How long before the judgment day?  
Before we cut the fat ones down to size  
Before the barricades arise  
  
Gavroche:  
Watch out for ol' Thenardier  
All of his family's on the make!  
Once ran a hash house down the way  
Bit of a swine and no mistake!  
He's got the gang the bleeding lay-about  
Even his daughter does her share  
That's Eponine she knows her way about  
Only a kid but hard to scare  
Do we care? Not a cuss!  
Long live us, Long live us!  
  
Beggers:  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man.
