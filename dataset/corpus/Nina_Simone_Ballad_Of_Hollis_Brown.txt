Hollis Brown  
He lived on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
And his cabin broken down  
Where you looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
You looked for work and money  
And you walked a rugged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they don't know how to smile  
Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve  
Your baby's eyes look crazy  
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour  
Bad blood it got your mare  
Is there anyone who knows?  
Is there anyone who cares?  
So you prayed to the Lord above  
Please send you a friend  
Yes you prayed to the Lord above  
Please send you a friend  
But your empty pockets tell you  
That you ain't got no friends  
Your babies are cryin' louder now  
It's poundin' in your brain  
Your babies are cryin' louder now  
It's poundin' in your brain  
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you  
Like the dirty drivin' rain  
Your grass is turnin' black  
There's no water in your well  
Your grass is turnin' black  
There's no water in your well  
You spent your last dollar  
On seven shotgun shells  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness  
A cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That's hangin' on the wall  
Your brain is a-bleedin' now  
Your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain is a-bleedin' now  
Your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand  
There's seven breezes blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes blowin'  
All around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the ocean's poundin' roar  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead  
On a south Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
Seven new people are born
