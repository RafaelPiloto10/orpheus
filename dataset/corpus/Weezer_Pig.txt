When I was a baby I was so happy  
I play with my friends in the mud  
Wilbur and Jack and Otis and Beatty  
We were a gang, you got to believe me  
Momma would scold us if we got too rough  
She didn't care, she was proud of us  
I ran around and talked to the animals  
Tellin' 'em stories of savage cannibals  
  
Then I got older and noticed a girl  
At first I was sure I didn't exist to her  
I sulker around but I didn't know why  
Then she put her cheek on my shoulder and I  
Was lookin' at her and she was lookin' at me  
We started to smile it was our destiny  
Tina was her name. She was my cutie-pie  
I forgot about things that I used to like  
  
I spent all my time followin' her around  
My friends all made the whip-lash sound  
But they understood. They was happy for me  
And everyone clapped when I asked her to marry me  
And she said "yes" and we felt so fine  
We lost track of the passin' time  
Before I knew it we had our own babies:  
Gina and Shannon and Keebie and Gabe  
  
But now I've got to die  
I've lived a good life I've got no complaints  
I'd like to thank Farmer Pete  
For bringing me scraps of food that I could eat  
He always had a smile on his face  
He didn't want to think of this day  
It's finally here  
It's finally here, oh  
  
Oo-oo, they called me pig  
Oo-oo, they called me pig  
  
When I was a baby I was so happy  
I played with my friends in the mud
