Living  
I is only one part of being  
Believing  
Is to know just what you're feeling  
  
You were so positive thing you know, you have  
I'm sure that in knowing you're growing and it's you  
  
Thinking  
Is you're own road of living  
Dreaming  
Is the one way to being  
  
Go in and your eye can see everything that's you  
The only real person you need to know is you  
  
Ah, oh  
Living, Living, Living
