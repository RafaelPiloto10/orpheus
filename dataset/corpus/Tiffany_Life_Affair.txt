We're off to the right start  
Put your hand on my heart  
Feel it beat with sweet intention  
Don't tell me 'sit tight'  
I'm too excited tonight  
Every touch takes me to heaven  
Got so much love inside, you know we're gonna make it  
Come here and turn the key, unlock all this ecstasy  
Let's start a life affair  
We have no time to spare  
To show how much we care  
Come on now let's start a life affair  
You know I'll be right there  
We make the perfect pair  
High as a kite now  
I've got perfect sight now  
I can see beyond forever  
It's gonna be just you and me boy  
Every day a new joy  
Loving more than we can measure  
So many dreams out there  
I know where we can find them  
Can't wait a minute more  
You're all I've been waiting for  
Let's start a life affair  
We have no time to spare  
To show how much we care  
Come on now let's start a life affair  
You know I'll be right there  
We make the perfect pair  
Dancing together this dance that lasts forever  
Never been so in love  
Eyes bright and open, a thousand new emotions  
Raining down from above  
Let's start a life affair  
We have no time to spare  
To show how much we care  
Come on now let's start a life affair  
You know I'll be right there  
We make the perfect pair
