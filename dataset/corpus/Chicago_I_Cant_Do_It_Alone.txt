(announcer) ladies and gentleman  
miss velma kelly in an act of desperation  
  
(velma kelly)  
my sister and I had an act that couldn't flop,  
my sister and I were headed straight for the top,  
my sister and earned a 'thou' a week at least, oh yea  
but my sister is now unfortunately deceased,  
I know its sad of course  
But a fact is still a fact  
and now all that remains is the remains,  
of a perfect... Double... Act  
  
Watch this!  
Now you have to imagine it with two people,  
its swell with two people,  
  
First I'd,  
Then she'd  
then we'd  
but I can't do it alone  
then she'd  
then I'd  
then we'd  
but I can't do it alone  
  
She'd say what's your sister like  
I'd say men,  
she'd say you're the cats meow  
then we'd wow the crowd again  
  
When she'd go  
I'd go  
we'd go  
  
Then those ding dong daddies started to roar  
whistled, stomped, stamped on the floor,  
yelling, screaming, begging for more,  
and we'd say  
Ok fellas, keep your socks on,  
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
(instrumental)  
  
But I simply cannot do it alone  
  
So what'd ya think huh?  
Come on you can say  
  
(roxie blows a raspberry)  
  
(velma)  
I know you're right the first part is shit.  
But the second part, the second part is really nifty,  
  
(takes a deep breath) ok  
  
She'd go  
I'd go  
we'd  
  
Then those two-bit johnny's did it around  
to cheer the best attraction in town  
they nearly tore the balcony down,  
and we'd say: ok boys we're going home,  
but before we go here's a few more partin' shots,  
and this, this we did in perfect unison  
  
(instrumental)  
  
Now you see me going through it  
you make think there's nothing to it  
but I simply cannot do it... Alone(hold note)
