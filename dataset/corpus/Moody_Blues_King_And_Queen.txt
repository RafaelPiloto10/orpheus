It's like awaking from a dream  
All I remember is a lullaby  
I couldn't tell you where I've been  
A thousand images just flutter by  
Takin' my time  
In a white limousine  
If I was the King  
She'd be my Queen  
And my thoughts are growing louder  
And my mind has lost its way  
And the flames are getting higher ev'ryday  
My mind is back behind my eyes  
And there before me sits a butterfly  
And as I watch, she gently cries (And as I watch, she gently cries)  
Can there be anyone who'll pity her? (Who'll pity her?)  
How many faces  
Have all of you been?  
If I was the King  
She'd be my Queen  
And my thoughts are getting louder  
And my mind has lost its way  
And the flames are getting higher ev'ryday  
My mind is back behind my eyes  
And there before me sits a butterfly  
And as I watch, she gently cries (And as I watch, she gently cries)  
Can there be anyone who'll pity her? (Who'll pity her?)  
How many faces  
Have all of you been?  
If I was the King  
She'd be my Queen  
And my thoughts are getting louder  
And my mind has lost its way  
And the flames are getting higher ev'ry day  
And the flames are getting higher ev'ry day  
And the flames are getting higher ev'ry day
