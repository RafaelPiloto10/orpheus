Cut the back, pull the stuffing.  
Cut the girl down to nothing.  
Feed the boy.  
...  
Disinfect the house.  
Disinherit. x3  
And it's creeping up, I spy it.  
And it's crushing at my throat  
And it's seizing my tongue and I'm numb.  
And it's bleeding on my face  
And it's foaming at the mouth  
And it's gnawing on my bones...  
And he's rolling up his sleeve  
And he feeds me  
And he's memorizing me  
And he's making his mark  
And he's making his mark  
Stop the car.  
Still the engine.  
Save your best until now.  
Dig your nails in.
