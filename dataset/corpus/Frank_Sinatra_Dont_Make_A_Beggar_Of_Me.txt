Don't make me beg for your kisses,  
Beg for your tender embrace,  
I want your love, not your sympathy,  
Please don't make a beggar of me.  
Since I looked in your direction,  
Your tenderness is all I seem to crave.  
But when I look for your affection,  
You smile, my dear, and tell me to behave.  
Don't make me beg for your kisses,  
Beg for your tender embrace,  
I want your love, not your sympathy,  
Please don't make a beggar of me.  
While I sigh and keep confessing,  
The love I have for you will never die,  
Somehow you always keep me guessing,  
And wondering just how long I'll have to cry.  
Don't make me beg for your kisses,  
Beg for your tender embrace.  
I want your love, not your sympathy,  
Please don't make a beggar of me.
