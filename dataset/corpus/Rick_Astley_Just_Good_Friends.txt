Said I love you a thousand times  
You don't betray your feelings  
But I can read the signs  
  
Stars are shining on a sea of tears  
I show my true emotions  
I have felt for all these years  
  
You cannot tell me  
That it's got to end this way  
There's nothing more to say  
  
[Bridge:]  
I just can't believe  
That you'll walk on out that door  
When I need you more and more  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again  
After promising to be  
Just good friends  
  
You say you need me, but you turn away  
I've got to show you how I feel  
I've got to make you stay  
  
You cannot tell me  
That it's got to end this way  
There's nothing more to say  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
