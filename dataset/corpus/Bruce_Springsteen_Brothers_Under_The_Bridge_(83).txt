Saigon, it was all gone  
The same coke machines as the streets I grew on  
Down in a mesquite canyon, come walking along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road or town  
There's too much brush in camp for the chp choppers to touch down  
Ain't lookin' for nothin , I just want to live  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come the Santa Anas and man that dry brush would light  
Jimmy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night  
We buried his body in the white stone high up on the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
I had enough of the town oh and the straight life  
Ain't careful you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife  
Now I want no trouble and I ain't got none to give  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Well I shipped home back in '72  
And you know you were just a beautiul light in your mom's dark eyes of  
Blue  
I stepped out on the tarmac, we were just kids  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come veterans' day I sat on the stand in my dress blues  
I held your mother's hand, and they passed with the red, white and  
Blue  
One minute you're right there, and somethin' slips...
