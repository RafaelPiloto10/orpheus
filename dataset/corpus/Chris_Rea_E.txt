E is for the comfort,  
You give to me  
E is for the peace, I feel inside  
E is for the good times  
That go against the bad times  
E is for the world you gave us  
And left us here behind  
They say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Let's talk about it  
E is for the reason  
To live through urban grey  
E is for the warm glow,  
That takes the fear away  
Show us what is better  
Why don't you stand inside  
these shoes  
Oh live with me each Monday...  
Let's see what you would do...  
Which world do you live in?  
Which world did you choose?  
Hiding the tears, that's all  
No win  
No lose  
They say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Tell me what's so wrong with E  
That's what I hear them say  
Let's talk about it
