Don't be my enemy  
Don't be my enemy  
You had your dreams  
You required a scheme of things  
Evolved, resolved through the years  
And I had my part  
(When you wrote me)  
But you broke my heart  
(When you wrote me)  
You spend your whole time trying  
To burn me to the ground  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  
I had a thought  
It was just a simple thought  
Of a friend, very close, very clear  
But then it stopped looking so straight  
(When you wrote me)  
You found the hate  
(When you wrote me)  
You spend your whole time trying to make  
Me look like your main fool  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?
