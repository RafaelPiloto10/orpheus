Do me wrong, do me right  
Tell me lies, but hold me tight  
Save your goodbyes for the morning light  
But don't let me be lonely tonight  
Say goodbye, woman say hello, say hello  
Sure enough good to see you, oh but it's time to go  
Don't say yes, but please don't say no  
I don't want to be lonely tonight  
Go away then damn you,  
Go and do as you please, go and do as you please girl,  
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees  
Cause I'm undecided, and your heart's been divided  
You've been turning my world upside down  
Do me wrong, do me right, do me right baby  
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight  
Save your goodbyes for the morning light  
But don't let me be lonely tonight  
Save your goodbyes for the morning light  
But don't let me be lonely tonight  
I don't won't to be lonely tonight no, no I don't  
Want to be lonely tonight  
I don't want to be lonely tonight
