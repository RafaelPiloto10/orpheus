We've got to face the face  
You must have heard the cautionary tales  
The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails  
From wiser men who have been through it all  
And the ghosts of failures spray-canned up on the wall  
We've got to judge the judge  
Got to find the finds  
We've got to scheme the schemes  
Have to line the lines  
We must stake the stakes  
And show the shown  
We must take the takes  
And know the known  
Try to place the place  
Where we can face the face  
Face the face, got to  
Face the face  
You must have tried and the defied belief  
Maybe found futility in insular grief  
  
I need your hunger just as you need mine  
A million appetites can swallow up time  
We've got to fool the fools  
And plan the plans  
We must rule the rules  
Got to stand the stands  
We must fight the fight  
And fall the falls  
We must light the light  
And call the calls  
We must race the race  
So we can face the face  
New York! Chicago!  
London and Glasgow!  
Keep looking!  
Keep on cooking  
Keep on looking  
Gotta stay on this case  
Study the picks  
Watch the fix  
We've got to find the face  
Try to place the place where we can face the face
