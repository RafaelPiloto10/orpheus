Once my future was shiny as the  
Seat of my pants are today  
Then old mother luck and all her  
Daughters started duckin' me  
When I finally got tired of just sittin' there  
Watching my life slip away  
I said I better start takin' all the living  
That's a-comin' to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I love too much, fight too much  
Stay out late at night too much  
But you bet your butt I'm going to  
Live before I die  
And I may smoke too much, drink too much  
Every blessed thing too much  
It's a low-down life, but it ain't gonna pass me by  
I don't care if the world don't ever hear  
The sound of my name  
And old mother luck and all her daughters  
Keep a-duckin' me  
As long as that cat that I gotta look at when  
I shave ain't ashamed  
There ain't no Jody in the world  
I'd ever rather be.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now I love too much, fight too much  
Stay out late at night too much  
But you bet your butt I'm going to  
Live before I die  
And I may smoke too much, drink too much  
Every blessed thing too much  
It's a low-down life, but it ain't gonna pass me by
