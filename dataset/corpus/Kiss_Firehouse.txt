Whoo, hoo, yeah  
Whoo, hoo, yeah  
  
She'll adore you and she'll floor you  
With her wisdom and her vision  
And you'll love it and think of it  
Till you lose all intuition  
Come on  
  
She can move you and improve you  
With her love and her devotion  
And she'll thrill you and she'll chill you  
But you're headed for commotion  
  
And you'll need her so you'll feed her  
With your endless dedication  
And the quicker you get sicker  
She'll remove your medication  
  
Get the firehouse  
Cause she sets my soul afire  
Get the firehouse  
And the flames keep gettin' higher  
  
She's like bad weather but it seems so good  
You'd never leave her but you know you should  
  
She's like bad weather but it seems so good  
You'd never leave her but you know you should  
  
Ooh  
Get the firehouse  
Cause she sets my soul afire  
Get the firehouse  
Whoo, hoo, yeah  
Get the firehouse  
Whoo, hoo, yeah
