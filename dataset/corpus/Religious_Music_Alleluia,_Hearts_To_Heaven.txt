Alleluia, alleluia, hearts to heaven and voices raise  
Sing to God a hymn of gladness, sing to God a hymn of praise  
He, who on the cross a victim for the world's salvation bled  
Jesus Christ, the King of glory now is risen from the dead.  
  
Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born  
Glorious life and life immortal on this holy Easter morn  
Christ has triumphed and we conquer by his mighty enterprise  
We with him to life eternal by his resurrection rise.  
  
Christ is risen, Christ, the first fruits of the holy harvest field  
Which will in all it's full abundance at his second coming yield  
Then the golden ears of harvest will their heads before him wave  
Ripened by his glorious sunshine from the furrows of the grave.  
  
Christ is risen, we are risen, she'd upon us heavenly grace  
Rain and dew and gleams of glory from the brightness of thy face  
That we with our hearts in heaven here on earth may fruitful be  
And by angel hands be gathered and be ever, Lord, with thee.  
  
Alleluia, alleluia, glory be to God on high  
Alleluia! to the Savior who has gained the victory  
Alleluia! to the Spirit, fount of love and sanctity  
Alleluia, alleluia, to the Triune Majesty...
