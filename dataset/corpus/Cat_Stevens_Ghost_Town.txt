Come on lets go down  
Everybody's waiting for us  
Down at the ghost town  
Bill Bailey said he'd be around  
If Mrs. G. Robinson would just put  
That bad Havana down  
  
Lovely Queen Anne Boleyn  
Learning new tricks from the Great Houdini.  
Now that's the way she's gonna make it  
Come on  
Come on lets go down  
Everybody's waiting for us  
Down at the boom town  
O. Redding and Washington  
Chico and Harpo and Karl are  
In the Kitchen with mum  
  
Buster Keaton and King Tut  
Are waiting for Disney to wake up  
Now that's the way  
No that ain't the way he's gonna make it
