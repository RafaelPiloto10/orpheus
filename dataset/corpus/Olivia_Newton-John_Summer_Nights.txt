Summer loving had me a blast  
Summer loving happened so fast  
I met a girl crazy for me  
Met a boy cute as can be  
Summer days drifting away to oh oh the summer nights  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Did you get very far  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Like does he have a car  
  
She swam by me she got a cramp  
He ran by me got my suit damp  
I saved her life she nearly drowned  
He showed off splashing around  
Summer sun somethings begun but oh oh the summer nights  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Was it love at first sight?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Did she put up a fight?  
  
Took her bowling in the arcade  
We went strolling drank lemonade  
We made out under the dock  
We stayed out till 10 o'clock  
Summer fling don't mean a thing but oh oh the summer nights.  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
But you don't gotta brag  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Cause he sounds like a drag  
  
He got friendly holding my hand  
She got friendly down in the sand  
He was sweet just turned eighteen  
Well she was good you know what I mean  
Summer heat boy and girl meet but oh oh the summer nights.  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
How much dough did he spend?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Could she get me a friend?  
  
It turned colder that's where it ends  
So I told her we'd still be friends  
Then we made our true love vow  
Wonder what she's doing now  
  
Summer dreams ripped at the seams but oh those summer nights
