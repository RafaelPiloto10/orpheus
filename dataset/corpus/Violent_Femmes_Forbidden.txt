Come with us and play!  
See, we have breasts as women!  
From your tents by the sea  
Come play with us: it is forbidden  
come with us and play!  
Lo, bare, straight legs in the water!  
By our boats we stay  
Then swimming away  
Come to us: it is forbidden!  
come with us and play!  
See, we are as tall as women!  
Our eyes are keen:  
Our hair is bright:  
Our voices speak outright:  
We revel in the sea's green!  
Come play: it is forbidden!
