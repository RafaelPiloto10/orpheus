There's a shortage on corn  
And there's a shortage on wheat  
There's a shortage on beans  
And there's a shortage on meat  
Things that we're needing we just can't hardly buy  
Soon we'll be asking if we're all gonna die  
But I know a great thing that there's no shortage of  
There's no shortage on God's mercy  
There's no shortage on God's love  
  
[Verse 2:]  
There's a shortage on fuel oil  
And there's a shortage on gas  
There's a shortage on wood  
And there's a shortage on glass  
Things that we've wasted are now precious to buy  
You know there's even a shortage on the air in the sky  
But I know a good thing that there's no shortage of  
There's no shortage on God's mercy  
There's no shortage on God's love  
  
Chorus:  
God is love and mercy unending  
His precious love will lead you, no doubt  
When from Satan you need defending  
God has supply that will never run out  
  
There's a shortage on friendship  
There's a shortage on smiles  
There's a shortage on neighbors  
Though there's millions for miles  
Thank Heaven for one thing that there's no shortage of  
There's no shortage on God's mercy  
There's no shortage on God's love  
  
Chorus  
  
There's no shortage  
There's no shortage... [ad lib]
