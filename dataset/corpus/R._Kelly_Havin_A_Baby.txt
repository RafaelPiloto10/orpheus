What is this news you got to tell me  
Girl, what has got you so excited  
Why would you call me on my job  
When I'm right in the middle of writing  
See you've got this look up on your face  
Spit it out girl I just cannot wait  
To get whatever it is up out of you  
So tell me girl, what it do  
  
I'll give you a hint  
It crawls 'fore it walks  
In a couple of years  
It begins to talk  
And it makes us so happy  
Girl are you telling me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm havin' a baby  
(Oh, I am so happy)  
I'm havin' a baby  
(And I'm so glad to be that baby's daddy)  
I'm havin' a baby  
(A lil' girl, a lil' boy, a lil' you, a lil' me)  
I'm havin' a baby  
  
(Girl it doesn't matter as long as it's healthy)  
  
While I can't believe I'm gonna be a father  
In nine months a child will be born  
Baby, your pregnant in April  
Which means we're havin' a Capricorn  
I'm so glad to be apart of this  
'Cause girl a child is heaven sent  
This is a blessing to me  
To have you with my seed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Girl it doesn't matter as long as it's healthy)  
  
Girl you got me Staring at you from head to toe  
When I look at you, it's like you've got this glow  
So much respect I got for you  
Girl since you told me what's good  
Ever since you told me I love you more  
Girl, what I feel is so spiritual  
And baby our lives have been changed  
Now I want you to have my last name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Girl it doesn't matter, now here it is nine months later)  
  
I'm havin' a baby  
(Push) I want you to (push)  
I need ya to (Push)  
Come on baby (Push)  
I'm havin' a baby  
(Push) (Push) I'm right here (Push) hold my hand (Push)  
I'm havin a baby  
(Push) baby push, Breathe (Push) your almost there (Push)  
I'm havin' a baby  
(Push) I love ya (Push, push, push)  
I'm havin' a baby  
Girl I can see it (Push) it's like a dream (Push) a miracle (Push)  
I'm havin' a baby  
A child unto me (Push) a baby boy (Push) a Robert Jr. (Push) thank you God
