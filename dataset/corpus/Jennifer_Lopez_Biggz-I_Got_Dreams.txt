[Verse:]  
I ain't a gangsta, that's just my image  
I ain't a thug either nigga, I just go along with it  
Fuck what the press tell you, listen to me  
I'm trying to tell you what's real, I don't live my life dangerously  
Live how I live, live by my rules  
You wouldn't survive just waking up in my shoes  
Yeah I dress like a thug, and talk like a gangsta  
But that don't mean I'm gonna clap at your crew  
Even if I strike rich, I'm stay with my crew  
I'ma stay with my peeps, I'ma stay in the streets  
I'ma keep spittin flames so my family could eat  
And now I'm not saying this to build my fan base  
And I don't give a fuck how many lives my hand takes  
And I'ma stay true to myself, I'm a man  
I'm a real nigga, hard to kill nigga  
Hard as a rock, I'm just Cris from the block  
Ya I'm that same troublemaking kid from the block (whut)  
[Verse 2:]  
I went from boy to man, ain't nobody gonn' stop me  
Holla Back nigga showing more hatred than the notzis  
I went from boy to man, from toys to guns  
Went from boy to man, from bottled milk to rum  
I went from boy to man, from the carriage to whips  
Now all the bitches wanna get married to Cris  
And there's Haze selling crack overseas,  
P. Diddy himself can't get rights to come and sample me  
You know I smoke to the sky and cook buckets of crack  
You that bitch ass that emptied out his budget for rap  
Biggs be the nigga that be running with gats  
Holla Back nigga, who else is fucking with that
