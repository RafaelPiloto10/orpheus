I pulled out with the mountain laurel blooming  
On a dirt road that is soon to be paved  
Down to the site of my original establishment  
And the west end family grave  
  
Cause one day moves into two  
(one day moves into two)  
And I'm losing  
Everything except for you  
(everything except for you)  
And I would sing you a song of devotion  
(i would sing you a song of devotion)  
Yeah that's what I should do  
(that's what I should do)  
  
Blood runs thick and when it rains it pours down  
(blood runs thick)  
On the family tree on the fields of war  
(the family tree on the fields of war)  
I spend my time being broken hearted and grieving bound  
(i spend my time being broken hearted and grieving bound)  
Yeah I haven't much need to look forward  
  
I just let a one day move into two  
(one day moves into two)  
I'm losing  
Everything except for you  
(everything except for you)  
I would sing you a song of devotion  
(I should sing you a song of devotion)  
  
Book of days  
(book of days)  
The way things lay  
(the way things lay)  
That's just space and time  
(that's just space and time)  
I gave it up  
(I gave it up)  
All for a love  
(all for a love)  
That won't be defined  
(that won't be defined)  
  
I've had enough temporary acquisition  
Building fences for no gain  
(building fences for no gain)  
Taking dead trees down before the winter freeze  
(taking dead trees down before the winter freeze)  
I said let em rot and fall where they may  
  
Just let one day move into two  
(one day moves into two)  
I'm losing  
Everything except for you  
(everything except for you)  
Ah yeah  
I would sing you a song of devotion  
(i would sing you a song of devotion)  
That's what I should do  
(i gotta let them fall where they may)  
(cause one day moves into two)  
It's the book of days  
(I'm losing)  
It's the way things lay  
(everything except for you)  
Now that's just space and time  
(I)  
(i would sing you a song)  
I gave it up  
(of devotion)  
All for your love  
(yeah)  
That's what I should do  
(that's what I should do)  
That's what I should do  
(that's what I should do)  
Yeah  
That's what I should do  
(that's what I should do)
