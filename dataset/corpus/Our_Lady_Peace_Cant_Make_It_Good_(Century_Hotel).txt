I  
I sit by the phone  
Waiting for someone to call me  
but I can't hear  
I'm just a little bit  
High  
I wanted to run  
But if there's somewhere to go, yeah,  
I'll be there  
I just don't know because  
I know  
I just can't let it go  
But if I could let you know  
That your leaving me alone  
And I know  
I just can't let it go  
But if I could let you know  
That would be right  
I just don't know  
(I)  
  
I sit all alone  
Surrounded by the man inside the speaker  
Just need some sympathy  
And then time  
(time)  
Is taking it's toll  
I'm afraid I'll sink deeper and deeper  
I'm sick of these tendancies and then  
  
I know  
I just can't make it good  
But if I could show you the world  
And the way I think that it should turn  
I know  
I just can't make it good  
But if I could show you the world  
And the way, the way I think that it should  
  
I threw in my soul  
Threw in my heart and intuition  
Don't need them stuck in here  
And then why  
(why)  
Why won't you come?  
Why won't you believe in what I'm missing?  
I'm missing, I'm missing  
  
I know  
I just can't make it good  
But if I could show you the world  
And the way I think that it should turn (x4)
