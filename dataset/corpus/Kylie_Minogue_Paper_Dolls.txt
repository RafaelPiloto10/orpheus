All around me  
This feeling has taken over me  
Thank God you feel it too  
'cause words would fail me  
And the spirits did bless this  
For getting on that road  
We were taken to a place  
Magical yet true  
As day becomes the night  
Love is in my life  
Nothing I have known  
Ever felt so right  
There's no more that I can do  
Than to fall a little more in love with you  
Here we are and we're paper dolls  
And we're side by side  
Here we are on the magic ride  
Just for you and I  
Everytime I look into your eyes  
I fall a little more in love  
Everytime takes me by surprise  
I fall a little more in love with you  
Do do do yeah  
Do do doo I fall a little more in love with you  
It's becoming the one thing  
That I want to last  
And there's never time enough  
The hours go too fast  
As day becomes the night  
Love is in my life  
Nothing I have known  
Ever felt so right  
There's no more that I can do  
Than to fall a little more in love with you  
Here we are and we're paper dolls  
And we're side by side  
Here we are on the magic ride  
Just for you and I  
Everytime I look into your eyes I fall a little more in love  
Everytime takes me by surprise I fall a little more in love with you  
Do do do Do do doo  
Mmmm I fall a little more in love with you  
Do do do yeah  
Do do doo I fall a little more in love with you  
Everytime I look into your eyes  
I fall a little more in love  
Everytime takes me by surprise  
I fall a little more in love with you
