You can't believe what you see. It's individuality.  
This world has made me who I am  
But you can't comprehend  
So you blindly consume their lies  
  
Evil wears a great disguise  
You have you no conscience man  
This is what made me who I am  
  
The social damage  
Controls your thoughts  
No minds of your own  
So you blindly march  
  
Live like this till the end  
Your lives I'll never understand  
I know I came from nothing  
Your all irrelevant to me  
  
And I don't want your help  
I hope you burn in hell  
Live by your own rules don't pretend  
Yeah zombies blindly follow trends  
  
Can't you see yourself?  
Just like everyone else  
Can't you see yourself?  
Just like everyone else  
  
You're trapped inside this mirror  
Nobody wants to break out.  
Break out.  
  
Someone tell me who's controlling all these marionettes.
