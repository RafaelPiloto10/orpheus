The piercing radiant moon,  
The storming of poor June,  
All the life running through her hair,  
  
Approaching guiding light,  
Our shallow years in fright,  
Dreams are made winding through my head,  
  
Through my head,  
Before you know, Awake,  
  
Your lives are open wide,  
The V-chip gives them sight,  
All the life running through her hair,  
  
The spiders all in tune,  
The evening of the moon,  
Dreams are made winding through my head,  
  
Through my head,  
Before you know, Awake  
  
Through my head,  
Through my head,  
Before you know,  
Before you know I will be waiting all awake,  
  
Dreams are made winding through her hair,  
Dreams are made winding through her hair.
