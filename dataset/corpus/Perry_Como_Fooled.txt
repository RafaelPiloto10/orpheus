Fooled, maybe I'm just being fooled  
Maybe I'll be ridiculed but I adore you  
If I'm fooled, then it's heaven being fooled  
For you taught a heart unschooled to live just for you  
  
Those who act cautious and wise  
Never have stars in their eyes  
If I'm in a fool's paradise  
Keep me there for I don't care  
  
If I'm fooled, and my mind is over-ruled  
Still my heart has not been fooled  
'Cause I'll always love you
