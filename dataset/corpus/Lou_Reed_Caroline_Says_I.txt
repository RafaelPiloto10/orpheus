Caroline says that I'm just a toy  
She wants a man, not just a boy  
Oh, Caroline says, ooh Caroline says  
  
Caroline says she can't help but be mean  
Or cruel, or oh so it seems  
Oh, Caroline says, Caroline says  
  
She say she doesn't want a man who leans  
Still she is my Germanic Queen  
Yeah, she's my Queen  
  
The things she does, the things she says  
People shouldn't treat others that way  
But at first I thought I could take it all  
  
Just like poison in a vial, hey she was often very vile  
But of course, I thought I could take it all  
  
Caroline says that I'm not a man  
So she'll go get it catch as catch can  
Oh, Caroline says, yeah, Caroline says  
  
Caroline says moments in time  
Can't continue to be only mine  
Oh, Caroline says, yeah, Caroline says  
  
She treats me like I am a fool  
But to me she's still a German Queen  
Ooh, she's my Queen  
Queen ...
