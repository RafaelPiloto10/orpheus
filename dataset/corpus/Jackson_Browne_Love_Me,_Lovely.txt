Lovely, lovely, did you see me  
Just as I was crying  
Love me lovely, make it easy  
What I say is hard but I am trying  
  
Lovely, lovely, can you hear me  
Listen to my singing  
Love me lovely, while you're near me  
Try and understand the thought I'm bringing  
  
Last night I was sleeping  
But I did not know if I'd awaken today  
Lie in my keeping, only know  
That I can't stay after today  
I'm on my way - love me lovely  
Love me lovely  
  
Lovely, lovely, you can't fool me  
I know that you need me  
Love me, lovely, now and truly  
Knowing that your love can only speed me  
  
Don't say how it could be  
Or I'll know that you'll be crying today  
Just how it should be I don't know  
So this I'll say  
I'm on my way - love me lovely  
Love me lovely  
  
Last night I was sleeping  
But I did not know if I'd awaken today  
Lie in my keeping, only know  
That I can't stay after today  
I'm on my way - love me lovely  
Love me lovely
