Down by the Salley Gardens  
My love and I did meet.  
She passed the Salley Gardens  
With little snow white feet.  
  
She bid me take life easy  
As the leaves grow on the trees.  
But I being young and foolish,  
With her did not agree.  
  
In a field by the river  
My love and I did stand.  
And on my healing shoulder  
She laid her snow white hand.  
  
She bid me take love easy  
As the grass grows on the weeds.  
But I was young and foolish  
And now I'm full of tears.
