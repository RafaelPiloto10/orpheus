[Alice]  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Must be something I said  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Don't deserve to roast or bake  
I'm fighting off slanderous allegations  
Why don't you give the kid a break?  
  
[Alice]  
Don't think maybe we could talk this over  
You're a reasonable man  
Could we discuss my grave situation  
I'm a miserable man  
And I'm in the frying pan  
Give the kid a break (continues over dialog)  
  
Devil: Give me one good reason why I should  
Alice: All right, all right, so I made a few mistakes but listen.. But for
heaven's sake  
Devil: Watch your language, Kid.  
Alice: OK, OK, don't get hot  
  
[Devil]  
Don't question my judgement  
He only reaped what he sowed  
He cast his pearls before swine  
And that's good enough for me  
  
[Devil]  
I don't want to talk it over  
Even tho' I'm a reasonable man  
Sonny, from over here looks like you're in no position to bargain  
You're a convicted man  
You're right in the frying pan  
  
Give the kid a break (continues over dialog  
  
Alice: Yeah, Please give me a break  
Devil: Nah, I don't think so, man  
Alice: Come on, you know I got what it takes. Can't you give me a break?  
Devil: Sure thing kid, when hell freezes over  
Choir: Ok, don't give the kid a break  
Alice: Hey you guys, I thought you were on my side  
Choir: No. Give the kid a break  
Alice: Yeah, well thanks a lot, pals  
Alice: Listen boss, maybe we can make a little deal. Is there anything I can
say, some kind of fine I can pay? Anything?  
  
[Alice:  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Must be something I said (I'm sorry)  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
It might be some sort of imperfection  
It might be a defection or a, a clear case of misdirection yeah  
It must be a small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Give the kid a break
