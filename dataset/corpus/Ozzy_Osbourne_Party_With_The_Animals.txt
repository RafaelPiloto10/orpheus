Into the night I've gotta go  
That's when the juices start to flow  
Everything will be alright  
  
I might be blind but I can see  
I got the power inside of me  
Everything will be alright  
  
I'm never gonna crack under a witch's spell  
Never put her chain's on me  
I'm never gonna break it  
No I'll never tell  
I know she'll never let me be  
  
Party, party with the animals  
Party, no dogs allowed  
Party, party with the animals  
Party, no dogs allowed no more  
  
I like it fast, I like it slow  
There's no direction I couldn't go  
Everything will be alright  
  
I like it loud, I like it mean  
I got the thunder in my machine  
Everything will be alright  
  
Dancing with disaster is a part of me  
I'm never gonna let it go  
Don't know what I'm after I'm deserting me  
The secret that I'll never know
