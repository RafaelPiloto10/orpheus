If love is real why can't you take love  
And lock love away in some safe place  
Where you won't lose love and keep love  
Each day untouched, so warm and near  
Where love will stay, so pure and clear  
The evenings pass and I wonder  
Where you are sleeping tonight  
Are you awake running through memories  
Remembering how good it felt when love took hold  
Our future plans that won't unfold  
Now days are long  
Just patches of time thrown together like clouds  
Of empty hours blinded by pictures of places we knew  
And now in space I stare  
Without your soul and voice to share  
It all seems lost  
Left are just words but without much to say  
'Cause if love's real  
You have to trust and let love go its way  
If love is real  
If love is real  
If love is real
