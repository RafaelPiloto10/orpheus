Had enough of this  
Out Out Out Out  
I seen a crazy dog, crazy dog  
In the flowers in the wood, crazy dog  
I've seen a crazy dog, crazy dog  
Crash through flowers in the big wood  
Do not know why it is that everywhere I go  
I'm seeing tall trees, tall trees  
They cover me  
All around me  
As they're standing up all around me  
With their big leaves, small leaves  
They cover me  
I've had enough  
I want out out, out out  
  
Gotta do something, can't do nothing  
Cause I know these people, they don't know me at all  
I want to hold you in my arms  
I want out, I want out, out out  
I want out, I want out, out out  
  
When I'm home I look around me in a room  
I see the white walls, stone walls, so solid  
And in the lonely night, watch the disappearing light  
On white walls, stone walls, swear they're moving in  
  
Gotta do something, can't do nothing  
Cause I know these people, they don't know me at all  
I want to hold you in my arms, again  
I want to hold you in my arms  
I want out, I want out, out out  
I want out, I want out, out out  
Out out out Hey Hey Hey out out  
Out out out Ho Ho Ho Ho...  
  
Come out of the night  
I want out, I want out  
Come out of the shadow  
Out of fear, out of fear and pain  
Into the warming sun  
Into the warming sun  
I will be with you again, will be with you  
Out of the shadow, out of fear and pain  
I will be, I will be, I will be, I will be  
I will be with you again  
Out Out, out, out  
Drain away the blood, out of darkness  
Out of shadow, out of the night  
Out of all the pain I'm going  
Ho Ho Ho Ho, out out...  
Out Out out out out Hey Hey...
