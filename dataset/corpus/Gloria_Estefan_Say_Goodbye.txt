I've seen and done it all it seems  
I've cried for all it's worth a few times  
I've lived and loved in search of truth  
I've seen a lot of pain oh, oh, oh, to finally realize  
The reason for this life  
Is to say goodbye to sorrow  
Don't hang on to the tears we borrow  
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel  
That we are so free, we are free  
I've seen the bottom once or twice  
I've soared above the earth as suddenly  
I've made a few mistakes, it's true  
I've seen enough of hate, oh, oh, oh, to finally realize  
There's not much more to life  
Than to say goodbye to sorrow  
Don't hold on to the fears we borrow  
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel  
We are so free, we are free  
We may long for happiness  
Pray to God that we be blessed  
Save us from this loneliness  
After all that I've been through  
I believe the thing to do  
Is to look inside of you  
And just say goodbye to sorrow  
Don't give up all the years we borrow  
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel  
That we are so free, we are free
