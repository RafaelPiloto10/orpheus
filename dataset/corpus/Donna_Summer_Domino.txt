Late last night at a fancy dress ball  
I was dancing with all the queens and lords  
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand  
And began dancing my eyes away  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
I was feeling so dizzy and lame  
Was it champagne or really him to blame  
Though our faces were disguised  
Feelings couldn't hide  
That this wasn't just some kind of game  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
Domino who are you  
Domino I'd like to know  
Domino who's the real domino  
Though we're strangers still  
It's real love I feel domino  
  
Then at midnight the bells were all rung  
And he kisses me and held me in his arms  
Then a crowd would ride between us  
Trapped away my stranger  
And I never did find him again  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's this man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino
