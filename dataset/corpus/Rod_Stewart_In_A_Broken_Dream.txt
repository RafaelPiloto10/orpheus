Every day I spend my time  
Drinkin wine, feelin fine  
Waitin here to find the sign  
That I can understand  
Yes I am.  
  
In the days between the hours  
Ivory towers, bloody flowers  
Push their heads in to the air  
I don't care if I ever know  
There I go  
  
Don't push your love too far  
Your wounds wont leave a scar  
Right now is where you are  
In a broken dream  
Did someone bow their head?  
Did someone break the bread?  
Good people are in bed  
Before nine oclock.  
  
On the pad before my eyes  
Paper cries, tellin lies  
The promises you gave  
From the grave of a broken heart  
Hmm  
  
Every day I spend my time  
Drinkin wine, feelin fine  
Waitin here to find the sign  
That I can understand  
Yes I am. Oh.  
  
I sit here in my lonely room  
  
Don't push your love too far  
You know your wounds wont even leave a scar  
Right now is where you are  
In a broken dream  
And don't you forget what I say  
  
Hoo, hoo
