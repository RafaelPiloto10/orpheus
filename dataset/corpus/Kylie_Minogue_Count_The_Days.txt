[Chorus:]  
Count the days till we're together  
(One-two-three)  
Though it feels like forever  
(We will be)  
Holding on to each other  
(You and me)  
You will be my only lover  
(Eternally)  
  
You made my day  
When a dozen red roses came my way  
Warmed up my heart  
'Cause I know you're thinking of me from afar  
  
Press a petal to my lips  
Feels like your kiss  
Don't you know that's what I miss  
To smell the sweet perfume  
Reminds me so much of you  
There's nothing else that I can do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's been so long  
I know our two hearts are strong  
There's not a moment  
That my spirit isn't in it don't you know it  
  
Try to occupy my time  
Remember you're mine  
Talking to you on the line  
Try to get used to this  
But long distance loving is  
Leaving me to dream of your kiss  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
When I'm feeling scared and lonely  
Wonder if I'm still your only  
Tell me now  
Soft and slowly  
It's gonna be alright  
You'll be by me side  
  
Press a petal to my lips  
Feels like your kiss  
Don't you know that's what I miss  
To smell the sweet perfume  
Reminds me so much of you  
There's nothing else that I can do  
  
[Chorus:]
