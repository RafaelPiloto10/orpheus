She sings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
It drips on down in a mist from above  
  
[Chorus]  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl  
The girl you want  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl  
The girl you want  
  
You hear her calling everywhere you turn  
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn  
But the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue  
She's the real thing but you knew it all along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at you with your mouth watering  
Look at you with your mind spinnin'  
Why don't we just admit it's all over  
She's just the girl you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She sings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
It drips on down in a mist from above  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at you with your mouth watering  
Look at you with your mind spinnin'  
Why don't we just admit it's all over  
She's just the girl you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl  
The girl you want  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
