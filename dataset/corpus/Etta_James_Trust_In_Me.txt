Trust in me in all you do  
Have the faith I have in you  
Love will see us through  
If only you trust in me  
Why don't you, you trust me  
  
Come to me when things go wrong  
Cling to me Daddy, oh yeah, and I'll be strong  
We can get along, we can get along  
Oh, if only you trust in me  
  
While there's a moon, a moon on high  
While there are birds, birds to fly  
While there is you, you and I  
I can be sure that I love you  
  
Oh, stand beside me, stand beside me all the while  
Come on Daddy, face the future, why don't you smile  
Trust in me and I'll be worthy of you  
  
Oh yeah, yeah, why don't you, you trust in me, in all you do  
And have the faith I, I have in you  
Oh, and love will see us through  
If only you trust in me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Why don't you, you come to me, when things go wrong  
Cling to me and, whoa, and I'll be strong  
We can get along, we can get along  
Oh, if only you trust in me  
Yeah, yeah
