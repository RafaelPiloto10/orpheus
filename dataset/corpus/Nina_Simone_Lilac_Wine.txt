I lost myself on a cool damp night  
Gave myself in that misty light  
Was hypnotized by a strange delight  
Under a lilac tree  
I made wine from the lilac tree  
Put my heart in its recipe  
It makes me see what I want to see  
And be what I want to be  
When I think more than I want to think  
Do things I never should do  
I drink much more that I ought to drink  
Because I brings me back you  
  
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love  
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love  
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly  
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?  
  
Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?  
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?  
  
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?  
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?  
  
Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
