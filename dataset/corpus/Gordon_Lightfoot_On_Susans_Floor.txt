Like crippled ships that made it  
Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore  
The homeless found a home on Susan's floor  
  
Didn't feel so cold and tired  
Stretched out before her fire  
Rollin' smokes and drinkin' up her wine  
And I remember candlelight  
And singing 'til we could not sing no more  
Then fallin' warm asleep on Susan's floor  
  
Well now that my song is sweeeter  
I think I'd like to greet her  
And thank her for the favors that she gave  
A stranger I came  
My head bowed in the rain to her door  
I sat and sang my songs on Susan's floor  
  
In the mornin' I'd go on  
Buyin' kingdoms with my songs  
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while  
Warm in the sunlight of her smile  
  
Well lots of time and songs have passed  
I catch myself just looking back  
Reliving all the wonder of those nights  
That's where I'd be today  
If I had only stayed one night more  
And sang another song on Susan's floor  
  
Like crippled ships that made it  
Through a storm and finally reached a quiet shore  
The homeless found a home on Susan's floor
