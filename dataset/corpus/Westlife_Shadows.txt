Morning after  
Still lingers  
Just waking up  
I see a shadow of you  
Making breakfast for two  
I go driving  
Past our place and  
I see this girl walk by  
I smell her perfume  
For a moment I wish it was you  
  
I'm not gonna tell ya  
I'm not gonna say that I'm okay, no  
I'm tryin' to get over  
I'm tryin' to get far away from our mistakes  
  
But I see shadows  
Everywhere that I go  
It's you, reminding me  
Of how we were  
Of how it was  
I see shadows  
Everywhere they follow  
It's you and memories  
Of how we loved  
I've had enough of your shadows  
  
Four months gone  
I can't feel you  
I don't understand it  
Where did you go?  
I hate that you're all that I know  
  
I'm not gonna tell ya  
I'm not gonna say that I'm okay, no  
I'm tryin' to get over  
I'm tryin' to get far away from our mistakes  
  
But I see shadows  
Everywhere that I go  
It's you, reminding me  
Of how we were  
Of how it was  
I see shadows  
Everywhere they follow  
It's you and memories  
Of how we loved  
I've had enough of your shadows  
  
You couldn't love me  
So why won't you leave me?  
Shadows  
Alone is the only place I want to be  
  
I see shadows  
Everywhere that I go  
It's you, reminding me  
Of how to love  
I've had enough  
I see shadows  
Everywhere they follow  
It's you, the memories  
Of how we loved  
I've had enough
