Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
She's walking down the street  
Blind to every eye she meets  
Do you think you'll be the guy  
To make the queen of the angels sigh?  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long  
When she moves my brain screams out this song  
Sidewalk crouches at her feet  
Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?  
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello  
I want you, hello, I need my baby  
Hello, hello, hello, hello
