I'll send her a rose and I wonder  
Will she cry or will she smile  
Darling, don't let me down  
Don't get some other one  
'cause I'm for you  
  
You're my sweetest angel, you go to my heart  
You're my sweetest angel, you've got the touch to my heart  
Baby, yeah  
  
I took her hand and she smiled  
Darling, I feel true love  
Damn it! I won't...  
Damn it! I won't let you down  
'cause I'm for you  
  
You're my sweetest angel, you go to my heart  
You're my sweetest angel, you've got the touch to my heart  
Baby, yeah  
  
I only need my little room  
A mirror and a brush  
Don't forget the nicest pillowcase  
  
You're my sweetest angel, you go to my heart  
You're my sweetest angel, you've got the touch to my heart  
Baby, yeah
