Oh holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of dear savior's birth!  
Long lay the world in sin and error pruning  
Till he appeared and the soul felts its worth  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine  
Oh night divine  
  
Hallelujahs for the holy night
