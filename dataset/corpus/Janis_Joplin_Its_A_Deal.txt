Wooh!!  
She's my baby, I'll tell you  
Just exactly what I used to do  
I will leave just to leave you alone  
Baby, baby, when I go home.  
  
Well love you baby I don't think I will  
Say the words but the bells go still  
It's true, baby, that I want you to stay  
But if that remains you got to pay your will,  
Pay your will, yeah yeah yeah.  
  
Well, I made you cry, hang your head,  
Life here was just smart and vain  
With your guys, baby, and you've gotta see  
When you're alone you want to make a deal.  
  
Well now love you baby I don't think I will  
Say the words but the bells go still  
It's true, baby, that I want you to stay  
But if that remains you got to pay your will,  
Pay your will, yeah! wooh wooh!!  
  
I wouldn't hurt but you can feel  
I'm leaving withdrawn you say it's a deal  
You may see inside my head,  
I love you, baby, but you're far away.  
  
Well now, love you baby I don't think I will  
Say the words but the bells go still  
It's true, baby, that I want you to stay  
But if that remains you got to pay your will,  
Pay your will, yeah yeah yeah.  
  
Pay your will, now yeah yeah  
Pay your will, yeah,  
Oh yeah, woohh!
