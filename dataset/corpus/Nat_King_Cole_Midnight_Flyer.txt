Midnight flyer  
Take me to L.A.  
Midnight flyer  
Take me to L.A.  
  
There'll be a whole lot of kissing  
When I jump off that Santa Fe  
  
Midnight flyer  
Roll on down the track  
Midnight flyer  
Roll on down the track  
  
The quicker I get there  
The sooner I'll get her back  
  
A pocket full of money  
A heart full of pain  
I won't be myself  
Until I see her again  
  
Midnight flyer  
Take me to L.A.  
Midnight flyer  
Take me to L.A.  
  
There'll be a whole lot of loving  
When I jump off that Santa Fe  
  
A pocket full of money  
A heart full of pain  
I won't be myself  
Until I see her again  
  
I got a whole lot of dust  
On my dancing shoes  
And I've got a lot of loving  
That I haven't used

Be on your way
