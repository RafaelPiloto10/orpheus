I was no one when I first met you  
I had nothing of worth in my life  
But then I found you and it all became clear  
You're the one that I've been searching for  
From the start I couldn't figure it out  
Why someone like you would die for me  
But I know that your love for me is so great  
And that is why I'm giving you my life  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
I can't believe that you're with me 'til forever  
I'll never leave you and you'll never leave me  
It's what I long for your presence here in my life  
Cause you're the air I breathe my reason why  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
You're the reason. You're the reason I live  
You're the reason. You're the reason I live  
You're the reason. You're the reason I live  
You're the reason. You're the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
My Jesus, You're the reason I live  
My Jesus, You're the reason I live  
My Jesus, You're the reason I live  
My Jesus, You're the reason I live
