Born into darkness in Saturn's sight  
Riding the night like the wind  
Ripping the heart form a world that is right  
Treading the borders of sin.  
  
Child of fire  
The souls that are damned  
By the pain that you bring  
Send you higher  
  
Slashing destruction, your right hand sword ringing  
To the ends of the earth you will fly  
Conquering masses in wanton deception  
Blood-red your black flag waves high  
  
Child of fire  
The souls that are damned  
By the pain that you bring  
Send you higher  
  
Look around, is this the end that you have foreseen  
The pain, the misery in us all  
What was it that you knew? Will we one day learn it too  
And together build another way, to the morning  
Or will it ever come again  
You've poisoned all our hopes  
We have nothing now, and what of the children  
What has this done to them? Damn you for the pain  
That they must feel  
  
The last hero standing no time to turn back  
He's listening, he waits for your call  
The black barren plains reflect the hope of the same  
For one only waiting to fall  
  
Child of fire  
The souls that are damned  
By the pain that you bring  
Send you higher
