Forgive the prince for awaking rude  
He heard footsteps near his head  
Lady luck had made him proud  
When he spends his stays in bed  
Making love to the victories  
Wives just paying for his head (?)  
Today will outlive yesterday  
As long as someone breaks the bread  
He's his mamma's pride  
He's his daddy's last heartbreak  
  
Well the sunrise in the kingdom  
Chicken's swooned to hear the man (?)  
Some find their way onto the paintings  
Others calling to the frying pan  
And the farmer's wife wakes him with smiles,  
Tender budging hands  
Meat and wine for all as long as someone breaks the land  
Meat and wine for all. long as someone breaks the land  
He's got his mamma's eyes  
He's got his daddy's younger hands  
  
Sunset makes the shadows longer  
But the tavern in the valley glows  
Stars fly on the forest, hell,  
There's a prince hanging out the window  
The farmer's daughter rubs his neck  
Her hands are strong from serving rum  
Today gonna outlive yesterday  
Tonight gonna outlive yesterday  
Tonight might make for kingdoms to come  
Kingdoms yet to come  
Kingdoms yet to come
