Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?  
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?  
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?  
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?  
  
Is it for all time or simply a lark?  
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?  
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?  
Or is it at long last love?
