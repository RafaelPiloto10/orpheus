Baby, we been knowing each other for a long,  
long time for somethin' like this to just go and break up everything.  
  
Here we are, just sittin' here  
Knowin' we're all alone  
My Rolley's lookin' at me  
Sayin' it's time to get it on  
You know what I want  
And baby, I know what you need  
So stop hesitatin', girl  
And give your love to me.  
  
[Chorus]  
All I really want is to love you, babe  
Make your body feel like heaven, babe  
I just wanna satisfy ya, babe  
That's all I want, that's all I want  
I just wanna give ya somethin', babe  
Just wanna keep it comin', babe  
I just wanna make you happy, babe  
That's all I want, that's all I want.  
  
Though the fireplace is burnin' marshmallows just right  
To who it may concern  
You won't be comin' home tonight  
Body parts that he DON'T kiss  
Girl, I will kiss for you  
Just put this CD on the repeat  
And let me pamper you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now the swimmin' pool's out back  
Come on and skinny dip, baby  
Eat breakfast in the morning  
That'll be complements of me  
In the middle of the night  
There's no need for morning here  
So hold your pillow tight  
Cause I wanna do it again and again.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Til the sun comes up)  
Baby, we'll be makin' love  
(And when the sun goes down)  
Still we won't have enough  
Take this love to you  
I will take care of all you need  
Baby, lets asure  
I just wanna set you free, free.  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
