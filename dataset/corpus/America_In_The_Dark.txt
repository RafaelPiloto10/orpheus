The day leaves me where I started  
Somewhere out in the cold  
The night enters broken-hearted  
One more suffering soul  
Baby, I can't tell you what is real  
I can only tell you what I feel  
Why must every line on the page  
Have a question mark  
  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
  
Look back across my shoulder  
The road was clear and wide  
Time, am I really that much older  
Where did the highway divide  
Baby, I remember every dream  
I just can't remember what they mean  
Still I find them hiding in my heart  
That's the crazy part  
  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
  
Here, wishing I could hold you till the dawn reappears  
Out there in the distance  
Somewhere in the shadows  
Something in the silence  
Something that I had, oh  
I can't tell you what is real  
I can only tell you what I feel  
And baby, all I'm feeling is alone  
That's the hardest part  
  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
Keep on searching (it keeps me in the dark...)  
Keep on searching (it keeps me in the dark...)  
Keep on searching (it keeps me in the dark...)
