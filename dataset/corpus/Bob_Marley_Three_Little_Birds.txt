"Don't worry about a thing,  
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright.  
Singing' "Don't worry about a thing,  
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright!"  
  
Rise up this mornin',  
Smiled with the risin' sun,  
Three little birds  
Pitch by my doorstep  
Singin' sweet songs  
Of melodies pure and true,  
Saying', ("This is my message to you")  
  
Singing' "Don't worry 'bout a thing,  
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright."  
Singing' "Don't worry (don't worry) 'bout a thing,  
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright!"  
  
Rise up this mornin',  
Smile to the risin' sun,  
Three little birds  
Pitch by my doorstep  
Singin' sweet songs  
Of melodies pure and true,  
Sayin', "This is my message to you"  
  
Singin' "Don't worry about a thing, worry about a thing, oh!  
Every little thing gonna be alright. Don't worry!"  
Singin' "Don't worry about a thing" I won't worry!  
"'Cause every little thing gonna be alright."  
  
Singin' "Don't worry about a thing,  
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright" I won't worry!  
Singin' "Don't worry about a thing,  
Cause every little thing gonna be alright."  
Singin' "Don't worry about a thing, oh no!  
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright!"
