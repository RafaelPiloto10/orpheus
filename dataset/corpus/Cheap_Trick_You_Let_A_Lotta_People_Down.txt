So how does it feel  
To stand so close  
And never understand  
How do you feel  
When you mean so much  
But you don't even give a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
You let a lotta people down  
You let a lotta people down  
You've got a lot to learn  
You can't do that  
Just who the hell do you think you are  
You can't do that  
  
Well you rode upon a wicked fence  
Could've fallen either way  
But you've chosen other losers  
In your sick sick game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just how can you keep goin'  
With all that's goin' on  
The best thing about knowing you  
Is knowin' when you're gone  
You let a lotta people down  
  
Your conscience has ghost writers  
Your dirty hands are clean  
Flesh and blood and life and death  
No it's no mystery  
  
[Chorus]  
You can't do that  
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' til a man starts comin' with a gun  
No you ain't seen nothin' til some nut starts comin' with a gun
