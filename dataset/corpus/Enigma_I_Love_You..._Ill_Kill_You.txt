I see love, I can see passion  
I feel danger, I feel obsession  
Don't play games with the ones who love you  
Cause I hear a voice who says  
I love you, I'll kill you  
  
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room  
  
Look into the mirror of your soul  
Love and hate are one in all  
Sacrifice turns to revenge and believe me  
You'll see the face who'll say,  
I love you, I'll kill you,  
But I'll love you forever  
  
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
