Turn the lights down low, I'm ready the break it off  
Since computer love, been wanting to set it off  
Like a hotel room I'm checking in to you  
Digging like shovel, all the things you do  
Take a leap over the broom, it's how you making me feel  
Come on in dis room, and let's keep it real, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
Half on a baby  
All I need is your body next to me (saying ooh)  
Ooh na na na na na (yo, yo body) Yo body na na na [Repeat: x2]  
  
Now tell me what the deal is, are u ready to bump  
It's gonna take a life time, to give u all of dis love  
So baby open up, and get ready to receive  
A miracle of love, getting down with me  
Like a baseball field, wanna hit a home run  
Me and u get together babe, and raise a lil' one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Set it off in a six, baby dat'll be cool  
Take a trip down town between me and you  
Sipping Don Perigdon  
Conversation like, what?  
Not afraid to go there, why don't u open up  
After 9 to 5, you deserve some 12  
Making future plans, to be where I dwell  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
From my toes up (From my toes up)  
To my knee cap (to my knee caps, to waistline)  
And slowly (and slowly, lady)  
Can we go half on my baby [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Chorus]
