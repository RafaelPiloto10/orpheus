[Verse 1]  
You make me invisible  
Like the sky, you make my day  
I feel so wonderful  
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go  
Now, see, there's a darker few  
It feels like I never saw the sun  
Should I shout for a rescue  
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go  
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hearts are beating, together  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Is this forever, and ever  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Two hearts are beating, together  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Is this forever, and ever  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Looks good in the sunshine  
Hold on, 'cause I'm coming up for air  
I cant even see up here  
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go  
Oh, oh, oh, don't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hearts are beating, together  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Is this forever, and ever  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Two hearts are beating, together  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Is this forever, and ever  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hearts (a-woo-woo-woo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Is this forever, and ever  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
I'm in love (woohoo)  
Two, hearts  
A woowoowoo, oh
