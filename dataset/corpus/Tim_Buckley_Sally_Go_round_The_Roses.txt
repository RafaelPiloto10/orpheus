Sally go round the roses  
Sally go round the roses  
Sally go round the roses  
Sally go round the roses  
Oh, Sally don't you go down  
Oh, Sally don't you go down  
The saddest thing in this whole wide world  
Is to find your baby been laying with another girl  
Sally, don't you do down, honey  
Aw, Sally don't you go down town  
Well, I'm going down town, Lord, I'm drinkin' tonight  
I'm goin' down town, gonna be dancin' tonight  
I'm goin down town, gonna drink myself blind  
I'm goin' down town, I gotta keep that mood high  
It's been a long time since I've had my way  
It's been a long time since I've had my way at all  
I want to do that drunken belly rub  
I want to sing that jukebox melody  
Now sally, don't you go down  
I want to stroll like we used to stroll  
Way back home in Baltimore  
Singing, Sally go round the roses  
Sally go round the roses  
Sally go round the roses  
Sally go round the roses  
Sally, don't you go down  
Oh, baby don't you go down town  
The saddest thing in this whole wide world  
To find your baby been laying with another girl  
Sally, don't you go down  
Oh, darlin', don't you go down town  
I'm singin', Sally go round the roses  
I'm singin', Sally go round the roses  
I'm singin', Sally go round the roses  
I'm singin', Sally go round the roses  
I'm singin', Sally go it around  
Sally go it around  
Sally go it around  
Sally go it around  
The roses, roses  
Sally going round the roses
