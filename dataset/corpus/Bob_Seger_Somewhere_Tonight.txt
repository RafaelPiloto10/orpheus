Somewhere tonight  
Someone's reachin' out to someone who's refusin'  
Someone's tired of all the reasons someone's using  
Someone doesn't understand  
  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's thinkin' back to someone who got closer  
Someone's realizin' something's really over  
Someone's thinkin' it's too late  
Someone's thinkin' it's too late  
  
There's a cold wind blowin' from the north  
And the summer birds are leavin'  
As the sun slips ever further south  
The lakes will soon be freezin'  
And the ice will claim the empty shores  
Where the one's in love went walkin'  
And the hard blue skies will shiver  
As the winter clouds come stalkin'  
  
And unless you find someone to hold  
Unless someone starts carin'  
Unless you find the warmth you need  
Unless someone starts sharin'  
When the long, dark nights come closin' in  
And the winter winds come howlin'  
You don't know if you'll make it  
Without someone you can count on  
  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's packin' up and someone's really leavin'  
  
Someone's not quite sad - only disbelievin'  
Someone's walkin' out the door  
Someone's walkin' out the door
