[Verse]  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I know I let you down  
Didn't I?  
  
So many sleepless nights  
Where you were waiting up on me  
Well I'm just a slave  
Unto the night  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now remember when I told you  
That's the last you'll see of me?  
Remember when I broke you  
Down to tears?  
  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I gave you hell through  
All the years  
  
[Chorus]  
So I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you  
I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been around the world  
And never in my wildest dreams  
Would I come  
Running home to you  
  
I've told a million lies,  
but now I tell a single truth  
There's you in  
Everything I do  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now remember when I told you  
That's the last you'll see of me?  
Remember when I broke you  
Down to tears?  
  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I gave you hell through  
All the years  
  
[Chorus]  
So I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you  
I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you  
  
[Bridge]  
Don't tell me that I'm wrong  
I've walked that road before  
And left you on your own  
And please, believe them  
When they say  
  
That it's left for yesterday  
And the records that I play  
Please forgive me for  
All I've done  
  
[Chorus]  
So I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you  
I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you
