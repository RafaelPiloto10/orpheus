Oh my, oh my, oh my, what if it was true?  
And oh my, oh my, oh my, tell me is it true.  
Did he, did he, did he die upon that cross?  
And did he, did he, did he come back across?  
  
Jesus walking on the water.  
Sweet Jesus walking in the sky.  
Sinking sand, took my hand, raised me up,  
And brought me up.  
I can hold my head up high.  
  
Will I, will I, will I be true to my birth?  
And will I, will I, will I give what I'm worth?  
Oh yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, I come when you call,  
And yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, sweet Jesus, my all-in-all.
