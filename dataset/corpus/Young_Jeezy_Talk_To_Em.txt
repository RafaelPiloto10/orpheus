Like the person needs his soul "uh huh, jeah"  
Fight the will "ay" to need his own "ay, ay, ay"  
"Just talk to em for a minute, ay just talk to em for a minute"  
Like the baby "ay" needs to cry "uh huh jeah"  
If you go "ay" I swear "jeah" ill die "ay, ay, ay"  
  
How the fuck I'm free out here and you locked in there  
Your whole family acts like I ont care  
They don't know about the nights I just lay in my bed  
I can't even sleep I just lay in my bed  
Eyes full of tears and a heart full of pain  
Take deep breathes every time I hear your name  
You was more than family you was like my brother  
So when the shit went down its like I lost my brother "ay"  
And I wish we could trade places  
Swear to GOD dawg wish we could trade places  
Livin' a life of crime, but it wasn't your life it was more like mine  
I often think about the close calls we had  
And I often think about the close brawls we had  
And I love my nigga what you know bout that  
And ill do anything to get goalmouth back talk to em  
  
Like the person needs his soul  
Fight the will to need his own  
"Make em understand, hey, please, make em understand"  
Like the baby "please, look, ay"  
Needs to cry "make em understand, ay, ay, ay"  
If you go I swear ill die  
"make em understand, jeah, ay, talk to em ay, ay, ay"  
  
Mel man you my heart I swear to god "swear to god"  
Knew you was real man I saw it from the start "from the start"  
Even when I was wrong my nigga had my back "yeah"  
Even when I was right my nigga had my back "damn right"  
We used to laugh wouldn't shit funny "naw"  
Late night at my grandma house counting money  
I trust you with my life dog if I was married id trust you with my wife dog  
Any given time a half a mill in your possession  
You ain't called in two days man I still wasn't stressing "naw  
Cause when I talk my nigga listen "listened"  
Switch shit you used to help me with them pigeons  
"Earnest" Earnest T. won't talk to me dog and it hurts "it hurts"  
She treats a nigga like I'm the scum of the life "scum of the earth"  
In your eyes I couldn't do no wrong "naw" so to you I dedicate this song "talk
to em"  
  
Like the person "ay" needs his soul "ay"  
Fight the will "talk to em for me my nigga" to need his own  
"gotta feel me on this one, jeah, ay, talk to em in tongues nigga,  
Do it make these niggas understand"  
Like the baby "ay" needs to "I love you Mat Lou"  
Cry "uh huh, talk to em"  
If you go "I don't think they understand me my nigga"  
I swear ill die "jeah, talk to em, ay, ay, ay"  
  
Must've bust ten rounds through the strap in your lap  
Knew I was a gangsta I wasn't going for that  
Pussy nigga in my yard talkin' shit  
Knowin' damn well I was on some G shit  
Let the whole clip ride and didn't think  
Let the whole clip ride and didn't blink  
You told me kindly not to bring the white in your house  
And then what I do bring the white in the house  
Bricks in the addict and yean know  
Your grandson killin' em he getting 24  
Feds at the door I'm out of town  
Yean tell 'em shit, you held me down  
Now a-days I rock the mic I'm getting paid for that  
And all the shit I been through I'm getting paid for that  
Always said I would make, wish you could see me now  
But if I tried to tell her she probably wouldn't believe me now
