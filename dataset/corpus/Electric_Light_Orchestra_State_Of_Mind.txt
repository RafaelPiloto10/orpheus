I was goin' round the world  
I was lookin' for somewhere  
I was searchin' for someone  
Who was gonna take me there  
  
Didn't want to do it 'cause I knew what I'd find  
Your're Really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah  
  
I was thinkin' of the past  
I was tryin' to rack my brain  
I was looking at the future, looking at the future  
I was tryin' to play the game  
  
Didn't want to do it 'cause I knew what I'd find  
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah  
  
Sometimes you get lost  
Sometimes you get found  
In a state of mind  
Sometimes you're too high  
Sometimes you're too down  
It's just a state of mind  
  
Didn't want to do it 'cause I knew what I'd find  
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah  
  
Sometimes you get lost  
Sometimes you get found  
In a state of mind  
Sometimes you're too high  
Sometimes you're too down  
It's just a state of mind  
  
You think you know it all  
Then you think that you know nothing  
Can't dance, can't crawl, crawl  
Maybe you better forget it  
  
Didn't want to do it 'cause I knew what I'd find  
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah  
  
Didn't want to it 'cause I knew what I'd find  
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah  
  
Didn't want to it 'cause I knew what I'd find  
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah  
  
State of mind  
It's a state of mind  
State of mind  
State of mind  
State of mind  
State of mind
