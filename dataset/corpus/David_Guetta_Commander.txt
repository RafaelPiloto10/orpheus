I feel like the dj is my bodyguard  
You see the way he keeps me safe  
With the treble and that bass  
I feel free enough to party hard  
This dress won't go to waste  
Feels like I own the place  
V. I. P to to be the boss  
You see the way these people stare  
Watching how I fling my hair  
I'm a dancefloor lover  
Baby there's no other  
Who do it like I do it yeah  
  
(Chorus:)  
From here on out  
I'll be your commander  
No fear no doubt  
I'll provide the answer  
Right now I command you to dance  
I'll be your commander  
Right now I command you to dance  
I'll be your commander  
Right now I command you to...  
  
I- I'll be your commander  
I'll provide the asnwer  
  
(Verse 2:)  
Ain't no reason to celebrate  
But you know we gon' hav a ball Champagne spillin' from the wall  
And I'll be partying til hella late  
But I ain't worried not at all  
I just give my driver a call yeah  
(Tell him) Pick me up at 8am  
No we ain't stopping right here  
We'll take the party to the crib  
Let's go all night baby  
You won't find no lady  
Who does it like I does it yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's jam packed  
So dj where you at?  
I know you got my back  
So make that bass attack  
Let's make these people move  
You know I need some room, to  
Do what I do, I'm bout to act a fool  
Turn the lights on  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I-I'll be your commander  
I'll provide the answer.
