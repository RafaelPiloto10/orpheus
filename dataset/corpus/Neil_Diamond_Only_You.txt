Only you  
You and the night and the right kind of music  
And only you  
There's only you  
And only the moments that we've spent together will ever do  
And only me  
  
Me like the fool with his head in the cloud  
Could believe  
But I believe  
Dreams will come true  
With only you  
  
And so I dreamed  
I'll wait for the moment I'm praying and hoping that what I dreamed  
Will soon come true  
I'll have you forever and never be lonely again  
Not only friends, but lovers too  
With only you  
  
Me, I was that fool on the hill  
You know I will be waiting there still  
Hoping you'd come back again  
I heard your name  
Echoing soft through the trees  
I know it was calling to me  
And nothing could keep me away  
I only wanted to hold you  
And only you  
  
There's only you  
And only me  
Me like the fool with his head in the cloud  
Could believe  
But I believe  
Dreams will come true  
With only you  
  
Me, I was that fool on the hill  
You know I will be waiting there still  
Hoping you'd come back again  
I heard your name  
Echoing soft through the trees  
I know it was calling to me  
And nothing could keep me away  
I only wanted to hold you  
And only you  
  
You and the night and the right kind of music  
And only you  
Hey, there's only you  
Only you  
Hey, it's only you  
Only you
