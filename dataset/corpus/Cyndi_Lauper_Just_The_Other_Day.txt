Just the other day-  
I heard you walked out on her  
Just the other day-  
I heard it's not forever  
You say, anyway-  
You said it's not like before  
Just the other day-  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go.  
Just the other day-  
You lost the girl you adored  
Just the other day-  
You boyish love was the cause  
Did she cost you pain  
You could have held out for more  
Just the other day-  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go  
I see your walking alone  
Will you still talk to me  
If she's not by your side anymore.
