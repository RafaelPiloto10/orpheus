Victim the cards were dealt with less time for me  
Rebel my only way to avoid your sympathy  
Virtue spellbinding charm,  
And the strength of a hurricane  
Black sheep the rebel son,  
That clashed with authority  
  
Powerless at least I have tonight  
The roads not long at least I have tonight  
  
Bloodline few will see this through till the end  
Cower some hide in fear,controlled by ignorance  
Eyes closed the cruelest site for those to see  
Sting your conscience seared as anguish tears away  
  
I might not come back tomorrow  
Please know I chose the right path for me  
  
I've lived, I've died  
I've done it all a thousand times  
And I don't regret a thing I've done  
This time was mine to have  
  
Wanderer I've seen it all like no other man,  
I've seen the light of all worlds  
Father I did my best for lack of my own  
Son a ragged path,but the love was not unknown  
Brother the best of times a forever unyielding bond  
  
Free from this disease  
Farewell I'll miss you all
