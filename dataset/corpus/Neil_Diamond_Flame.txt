They call her Flame  
For obvious reasons  
And I'll admit that's its frightnin'  
Whenever her lightening flashes  
Only ashes remain  
Don't get to close  
My friends all warned me  
And maybe I should of learned  
By the boys who were burned by the fire  
When they played with Flame  
After all I told myself  
She's a girl of flesh and blood  
And I'm a man  
Yeah, who's been around  
So I got dressed like royalty  
And was off for all to see  
The king of fools  
Just waiting to be crowned  
You know the rest  
It's a old, old story  
I've got a new kind of heartburn  
And friend if you're smart,  
Learn my lesson  
Don't go messin' with Flame  
Don't go messin' with Flame  
Don't go messin' with Flame
