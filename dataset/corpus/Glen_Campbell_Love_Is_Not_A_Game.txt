Love is like a warm and tender rain  
Splashin' on the roof  
Beatin' on the window pain  
  
She was like a soft and gentle breeze  
Seemin' so sincere  
Pretty as you please  
  
Though the time we spent together was so small  
I keep wondering if I'll pull through it all  
But the way you held me close and call my name  
The pain I'm feelin' now  
Tells me love is not a game  
  
Every time I looked into her eyes  
I couldn't really see  
What was on her mind  
'Cause she'd been through this many times before  
I never realised I must have been a bore  
  
Now I believe in love to be  
Just simple truth and harmony  
Happiness both day and night  
No one wrong or right  
  
But the way you held me close and call my name  
And the pain I'm feelin' now  
Tells me love is not a game
