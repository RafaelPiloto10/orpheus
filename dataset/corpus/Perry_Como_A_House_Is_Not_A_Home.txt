A chair is still a chair  
Even when there's no one sittin' there  
But a chair is not a house  
And a house is not a home  
When there's no one there,  
To hold you tight  
An' no one there  
You can kiss goodnight...  
  
A room is still a room  
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom  
But a room is not a house  
And a house is not a home  
When the two of us  
Are far apart  
An' one of us  
Has a broken heart...  
  
Now an' then  
I call your name  
An' suddenly your face appears  
But it's just a crazy game  
When it ends  
It ends in tears...  
  
Darling have a heart  
Don't let one mistake keep us apart  
I'm not meant to live alone  
Turn this house into a home  
When i climb the stair  
An' turn the key  
Oh please be there  
Still in love with me...  
  
I'm not meant to live alone  
Turn this house into a home  
When i climb the stair  
An' turn the key  
Oh please be there  
Still in love with me . . .
