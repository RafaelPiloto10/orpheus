You probably wanna smooth her smooth out with like some ahh  
But first of all you gotta understand on the Alkaholik level  
They, they don't wanna get Absolut-ed out  
And hit they head on the headboard but that's another level  
So we'll go ahead, umm

Smooth em out, real silky, knahmean?  
Cranberry, yo some cranberry orange juice  
That's all you need

Do your thing  
You wanna get some goosepimples, it's all good (and it's like that)  
Aight?
