The bars are crowded with wasted youth  
You just went, you didn't know the truth  
You don't know that kid when you look back  
You remember the music, paint it black  
  
You had a brother in the movement and he burned his card  
He's got a job in the white house, ain't life hard  
You came back a hero on a stolen horse  
You say you don't fit in, you can't stay the course  
  
I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong  
It's a veteran's song  
I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong  
It's a veteran's song  
  
The band paraded playing "Oh gung ho""  
Your country needs you, you've got to go  
When you came over they said "Soldier go back"  
When you came home they put you on the rack  
  
Between agent orange and the jungle and fear  
You're just surviving to get out of here  
You smoke some more herb and you keep your head down  
Could be your number is on the next round.
