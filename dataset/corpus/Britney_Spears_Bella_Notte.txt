Oh this is the night  
Its a beautiful night  
And we call it bella notte  
Look at the skys  
They have stars in their eyes  
On this lovely bella notte  
Side by side with your loved one  
You will find the enchanment here  
The night the night will weave its magical spell  
When the one you love is near, oh  
This is the night  
And the heavens all rise  
On this lovely bella notte  
  
(repeat)
