Well swingin' on the front porch swingin' on the lawn  
Swingin' where we want 'cause there ain't nobody home  
Swingin' to the left and swingin' to the right  
If I think about baseball I'll swing all night yeah  
  
Swingin' in the living room swingin' in the kitchen  
Most folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'  
Swingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her  
So I mixed up the batter and she licked the beater  
  
I scream you scream we all scream for her  
Don't even try 'cause you can't ignore her  
  
She's my cherry pie  
Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise  
Tastes so good make a grown man cry  
Sweet cherry pie oh yeah  
  
She's my cherry pie  
Put a smile on your face ten miles wide  
Looks so good bring a tear to you eye  
Sweet cherry pie yeah  
  
Swingin' to the drums swingin' to guitar  
Swingin' to the bass in the back of my car  
Ain't got money ain't got no gas  
But we'll bet where we're goin' if we swing real fast  
  
Swingin' in the bathroom swingin' on the floor  
Swingin' so hard we forgot to lock the door  
In walks her daddy standin' six foot four  
He said you ain't gonna swing with my daughter no more
