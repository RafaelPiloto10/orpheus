You thought she'd cared for you and so you acted smart  
Go on and break your crazy heart  
You lived on promises I knew would fall apart go on and break your crazy heart  
You never would admit you were mistaken  
You didn't even know the chances you were taken  
I knew you couldn't meant I've told you from the start  
Go on and break your crazy heart  
[ piano - guitar ]  
I knew you'll wake up and find her missin'  
I tried my best to warn you but you wouldn't listen  
You told me I was wrong you thought that you were smart  
Go on and break your crazy heart
