Sometimes we make it harder than it is  
We'll take a perfect night  
And fill it up with words we don't mean  
Dark sides best unseen  
And we wonder why we're feeling this way.  
  
Sometimes i wonder if we really feel the same  
Why we can be unkind  
Questioning the strongest of hearts  
That's when we must start  
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far.  
  
That's what love is for  
To help us through it  
That's what love if for  
Nothing else can do it.  
  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby, that's what love is for.  
  
Sometimes i see you  
And you don't know i am there  
And i'm washed away by emotions  
I hold deep down inside  
Getting stronger with time  
It's living through the fire  
And holding on we find  
  
That's what love is for  
To help us through it  
That's what love if for  
Nothing else can do it.  
  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby, that's what love is for.  
  
Believing in the one thing  
That has gotten us this far  
That's what love is for  
To help us through it  
That's what love if for  
Nothing else can do it.  
  
Round off the edges  
Talk us down from the ledges  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby, that's what love is for  
That's what love if for.  
  
That's what love if for  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
  
Baby, that's what love is for.  
That's what love if for.  
That's what love if for.  
That's what love if for.
