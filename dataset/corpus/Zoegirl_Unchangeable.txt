You said You'd never leave  
You said You'd never forsake me  
Time after time I see every little thing You do  
And all You say turns out to be for real  
And all Your promises come true  
Now I have all the things I need to live for You  
A faith that's unshakable  
A heart that's unbreakable  
Your truth that has set me free  
A love that's unchangeable  
A life that's available if I would've just believed  
That's what You gave to me  
With every passing day  
You prove You've stayed the same  
It's taken some time to see  
That I am the one who's changed  
Now I will never be the same  
Since You've made me see  
You shower me with  
Every good thing that I can be  
From the moment that I first believed  
I was free and now  
You have given to me every good thing
