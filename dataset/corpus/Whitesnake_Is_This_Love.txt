I should have known better  
Than to let you go alone  
It's times like these  
I can't make it on my own  
Wasted days, and sleepless nights  
An' I can't wait to see you again  
  
I find I spend my time  
Waiting on your call  
How can I tell you, babe  
My back's against the wall  
I need you by my side  
To tell me it's alright  
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore  
  
Is this love that I'm feeling  
Is this the love that I've been searching for  
Is this love or am I dreaming  
This must be love  
'Cause it's really got a hold on me  
A hold on me  
  
I can't stop the feeling  
I've been this way before  
But, with you I've found the key  
To open any door  
I can feel my love for you  
Growing stronger day by day  
An' I can't wait too see you again  
So I can hold you in my arms  
  
Is this love that I'm feeling  
Is this the love that I've been searching for  
Is this love or am I dreaming  
This must be love  
'Cause it's really got a hold on me  
A hold on me  
  
Is this love that I'm feeling  
Is this the love that I've been searching for  
  
Is this love or am I dreaming
