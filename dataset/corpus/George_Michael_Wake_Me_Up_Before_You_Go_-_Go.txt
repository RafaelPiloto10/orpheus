Jitterbug  
Jitterbug  
Jitterbug  
You put the boom boom into my heart  
  
You send my soul sky high  
When your loving starts  
Jitterbug into my brain goes a' bang bang bang till my feet do the same  
If somethings bugging you  
If something ain't right  
  
My best friend told me what you did last night  
Left me sheeting in my bed I was dreaming  
  
But I should have been with you instead  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up before you go-go  
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo  
Wake me up before you go-go  
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high  
Wake me up before you go-go  
Cause I'm not planning on going solo  
Wake me up before you go-go  
Take me dancing tonight  
I wanna hit that high  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
You put the grey skies outta my way  
  
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.  
You turn a bright spark into a flame  
  
My beats per minute never been the same  
  
Cause you're my lady  
I'm your fool  
It makes me crazy  
  
When you act so cruel  
Come on baby  
Lets not fight  
We'll go dancing  
Everything will be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuddle up baby  
Move in tight well go  
Dancing tomorrow night  
It's cold out there  
But 'it's warm in bed  
They can dance  
We'll stay home instead...  
  
Jitterbug  
  
[Chorus: x2]
