They said release 'Remote Control'  
But we didn't want it on the label  
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"  
The people laughed but the press went mad  
  
Ooh ooh ooh someone's really smart  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, that's a laugh  
  
On the last tour my mates couldn't get in  
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again  
At every hotel we was met by the Law  
Come for the party - come to make sure!  
  
Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong?  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song  
  
They said we'd be artistically free  
When we signed that bit of paper  
They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee  
An' worry about it later  
  
Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control - lemme see your other hand!  
  
All over the news spread fast  
They're dirty, they're filthy  
They ain't gonna last!  
  
This is Joe Public speaking  
I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind  
  
Total  
See-o-n control - that means you!
