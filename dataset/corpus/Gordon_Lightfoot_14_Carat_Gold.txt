If you see me smile don't think I'm acting strange  
I got my just reward for all my pains  
I you see me on the TV talking proud  
Please understand if I don't talk too loud  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll  
This is my advice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin' hot 'n' cold  
She's more than money  
She's 14 Karat Gold  
  
If you wonder why I'm acting up this way  
Gonna cash my chips I'm leavin' town today  
I got more love than I could ever spend  
So long, farewell, good-bye, this is the end  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll  
Be as cool as ice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin' hot 'n' cold  
She's more than money  
She's 14 Karat Gold  
  
If you get hit by the bug that bit on me  
If you get caught with something soft and sweet  
If you get found with something you can't waste  
Then listen bud, let me give you a taste  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll  
This is my advice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin' hot 'n' cold  
She's more than money  
She's 14 Karat Gold  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll  
Be as cool as ice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin' hot 'n' cold  
She's more than money  
She's 14 Karat Gold
