Once was a time you and I  
Made a promise till the day we die  
I trusted each and every word  
Never thinkin' that I'd get burned  
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales  
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well  
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried  
And it cuts like a knife  
  
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips  
Or ever will deceive these eyes  
Believe me when I tell you this  
Baby boy it's the last time  
I'm ever gonna cry these tears  
I'm ever gonna hear your lies  
So listen while I make it clear  
In case you didn't hear  
This time's the last time  
There's no time  
To give it one more try  
There's only time to say goodbye  
  
Fooled me once shame on you  
Fooled me twice now this song is through  
The things you said I can never forget  
The things you did for my heart went through bad  
But I'm still standin' tall as I walk away  
And you know that it's true when you hear me say  
It's over, it's through  
Ain't nothin' you can do boy it's sad but it's true  
  
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips  
Or ever will deceive these eyes  
Believe me when I tell you this  
Baby boy it's the last time  
I'm ever gonna cry these tears  
I'm ever gonna hear your lies  
So listen while I make it clear  
In case you didn't hear  
This time's the last time  
There's no time  
To give it one more try  
There's only time to say goodbye  
  
Goodbye, no baby  
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales  
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well  
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried  
And it cuts like a knife  
  
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these
lips)  
Or ever will deceive these eyes  
Believe me when I tell you this  
Baby boy it's the last time  
I'm ever gonna cry these tears  
I'm ever gonna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)  
So listen while I make it clear  
In case you didn't hear  
This time's the last time  
There's no time  
To give it one more try  
It's over it's through nothin' you can do and wonder why  
There's only time to say goodbye  
  
Baby, goodbye  
Never gonna never gonna cry no more  
Goodbye, goodbye
