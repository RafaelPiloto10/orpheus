Does it matter if you broke this spell  
So unreal is the future life along the way  
They dare you  
To turn around, it all comes through this feel  
It doesn't ring true  
  
Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world  
Silent talking, always dreaming, sing me to this beautiful world  
Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world  
Silent talking, always dreaming, sing me to this beautiful world
