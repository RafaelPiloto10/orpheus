Could be honeycomb  
In a sea of honey  
A sky of honey  
Whose shadow, long and low  
Is slipping out of wet clothes?  
And changes into  
The most beautiful  
Iridescent blue  
  
Who knows who wrote that song of Summer  
That blackbirds sing at dusk  
This is a song of color  
Where sands sing in crimson, red and rust  
Then climb into bed and turn to dust  
  
Every sleepy light  
Must say goodbye  
To day before it dies  
In a sea of honey  
A sky of honey  
Keep us close to your heart  
So if the skies turn dark  
We may live on in  
Comets and stars  
  
Who knows who wrote that song of Summer  
That blackbirds sing at dusk  
This is a song of color  
Where sands sing in crimson, red and rust  
Then climb into bed and turn to dust  
Who knows who wrote that song of Summer  
That blackbirds sing at dusk  
This is a song of color  
Where sands sing in crimson, red and rust  
Then climb into bed and turn to dust  
  
Oh sing of summer and a sunset  
And sing for us, so that we may remember  
The day writes the words right across the sky  
They all go all the way up to the top of the night
