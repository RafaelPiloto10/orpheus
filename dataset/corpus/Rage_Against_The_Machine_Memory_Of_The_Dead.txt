Wealthy vampires  
With the cold hands of executioners  
Execute  
Executive decisions  
Determined to destroy  
What 1 million women, children, and men  
1910  
Died, drowning in the rage of battle.  
Mothers, half naked  
Infants clutching thier necks  
Running frantically  
Tripping over the bodies of their sons  
Teeth gnashing  
Swinging machete  
Spitting blood and mud, and screaming:  
Land, and liberty!  
Were erased.  
Buried and burned  
Along with the memory of the dead  
Along with the ejido.  
With the smooth stroke of a pen  
And with the ghost of nixon present in their eyes  
They smiled.  
And pronounced the omnipitence  
Of the free market  
The profits of profit  
Extending the scurge of columbus and pizarro  
The freedom to buy things you can never afford  
The freedom for indians to buy corn that once flourished overgrown in their
backyards  
The freedom to die of curable disease  
The freedom to watch their children's stomachs swell and burst  
The freedom to starve and die  
Without land  
Or liberty  
But ramona, with eyes of obsidian  
Peering through her blood and sweat drenched mask  
Darding, unseen  
Changing direction with the swiftness of a bird  
Through the shanty's of the canyon  
With every coyote, every insect, every phylum of life  
Urging her, propelling her forward.  
The leaves and branches of the forest  
Part for miles, clearing her path  
The voices and screams of the dead beneathe her feet  
Echo in the deepest chasm of her soul  
Hurling her, toward the city  
History surging through her veins  
Pulsing through her fingers  
Hurling her, towards the city  
She caresses her trigger  
And the words of magome fulfil her being  
And with each shot she fires, she affirms her movement  
Saying:  
Enough! Enough!  
No!  
I will see my own blood flow  
Before you take my land... Or my liberty
