Oo my little pretty one, pretty one  
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?  
Oo you make my motor run, my motor run  
Gun it coming off of the line, Sharona  
Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind  
I always get it up with a touch of the younger kind  
My-ee ey-ee by-ee ahee ah woo!  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
Come a little closer, over here  
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona  
Keep a little mystery, kissin' me  
Runnin' down the length of my thigh, Sharona  
Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind  
I always get it up from a touch of the younger kind  
My-ee ey-ee by-ee ahee ah woo!  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
When ya gonna get to me, get to me  
Is it just a matter of time, Sharona  
Is it a destiny, a destiny  
Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona  
Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind  
I always get it up from a touch of the younger kind  
My-ee ey-ee by-ee ahee ah woo!  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma  
Myee ey-ee by-ee ahee ah woo!  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
Ooooh my Sharona
