Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, yoo-hoo  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand, just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs, we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop  
  
There's a happy feeling, nothing in the world can buy  
When you pass around the cider and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, yoo-hoo  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand, just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
For a sleigh ride together with you, sleigh ride together with you  
Sleigh ride together with you
