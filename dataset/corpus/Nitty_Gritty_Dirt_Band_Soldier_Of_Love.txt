I am loyal on those who care  
Who care about the fate of love  
I know there's many others just like me  
I know they too had enough  
Of these hearts doin' battle on the frontlines  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
Wooh ohoh I am a soldier of love  
  
I've seen it in your eyes, you felt the heat  
There was a time when you believed  
Love is the only way to make it through  
Hardly another casualty  
From these hearts doin' battle on the frontlines  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
  
Look at all these hearts doin' battle on the frontlines  
Love's got no heroes in these modern times  
What love needs is a defender  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
Wooh ohoh I am a soldier of love  
Ohoh I am a soldier of love  
  
I am a soldier of love  
I am a soldier  
I am a soldier of love  
I am a soldier  
I am a soldier of love  
I am a soldier  
I am a soldier of love
