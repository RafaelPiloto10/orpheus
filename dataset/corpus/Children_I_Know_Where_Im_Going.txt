I know where I'm going  
I know who's going with me  
I know who I love  
And my dear knows who I'll marry.  
  
I have stockings of silk  
And shoes of bright green leather  
Combs to buckle my hair  
And a ring for every finger.  
  
Feather beds are soft  
And painted rooms are bonnie  
But I would give them all  
For my handsome winsome Johnny.  
  
Some say he is poor  
But I say he's bonnie  
Fairest of them all  
Is my handsome winsome Johnny.  
  
I know where I'm going  
I know who's going with me  
I know who I love  
And my dear knows who I'll marry.
