As I walk along I wonder what went wrong  
With our love, a love that was so strong  
And as still walk on I think of the things we've done  
Together while our hearts were young  
  
I'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain  
Wishing you were here by me to end this misery  
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder  
Why, why why why why why she (you) ran away  
And I wonder where she (you) will stay  
My little runaway, a run run run run runaway
