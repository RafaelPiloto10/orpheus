[Verse 1]  
I am coming from the edge of madness  
A Northern mourns the world of men  
Gonna drive them into exile  
Or never let them breathe again  
  
[Chorus]  
On that night under the raging Northern sky  
The seeds of legend lie  
Swollen almost to a man  
The War of Kings began  
  
[Verse 2]  
In a land thrown into darkness  
An army would arise  
The heathens died laughing  
At the kings bent his bone high  
  
[Chorus]  
On that night under the raging Northern sky  
The seeds of legend lie  
Swollen almost to a man  
The War of Kings began  
  
[Chorus]  
On that night under the raging Northern sky  
The seeds of legend lie  
Swollen almost to a man  
The War of Kings began  
The War of Kings began  
The War of Kings began
