Let me start it by telling you something  
I think there's one thing you should know  
We ain't playin' no games, this ain't no playground  
It's time to drop your sticks and stones  
  
'Cause I've been chasing dreams since I took my first leap  
And I'm gon' be lil' Bo so contemplate if you're the sheep  
And we gon' make a humble pie so egos cut a slice and take a piece, hey  
  
So, you see, there's no point in underestimating me, to me  
Lock up all your thoughts and throw away the key  
No, I don't want to hear it 'cause you're, no, it doesn't bother me  
  
Now I'm done with all your negativity  
And I'm gonna let it wash all over me  
I'll be stronger than your words, baby, I'm harder  
My smile lights up the world, I'm flyin' higher  
So stand down (don't wanna hear it)  
Back it up now (don't wanna hear it)  
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)  
Back it up, back it up-up now  
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)  
Back it up now (don't wanna hear it)  
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)  
Back it up, back it up-up now

She ain't waiting for luck, no wishful thinking,  
She's gonna do it on her own
