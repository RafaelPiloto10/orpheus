Well I'm finding it harder  
To be a gentleman every day  
All the manners that I've been taught  
Have slowly died away  
But if I held the door open for you  
It would make your day  
  
You think that I care  
About me and only me  
When every single girl needs help  
Climbing up a tree  
Well I know it don't take much  
To satisfy me  
  
Maybe it's whatever's in my head  
That's distracting me  
But if I could find emotion  
To stimulate devotion  
Well then you'd see  
  
Well I'm finding it hard to say  
That I need you twenty times a day  
I feel comfortable so baby why  
Don't you feel the same?  
Have a doctor come and visit us  
And tell us which one is sane  
  
I never said I wouldn't  
Throw my jacket in the mud for you  
But my father gave it to me so  
Maybe I should carry you  
Then you said  
"You almost dropped me"  
So then I did  
And I got mud on my shoes
