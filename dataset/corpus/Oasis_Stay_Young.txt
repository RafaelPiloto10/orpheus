One way out is all you're ever going to get  
From those who'll hand it out don't never let it upset you  
'cause they'll put words into your mouths  
  
They're making you feel so ashamed  
Making you taking the blame  
Making you cold in the night  
Making you question your heart and your soul  
And I think that it's not quite right  
  
Hey ! Stay young and invincible !  
'cause we know just what we are  
And come what may we're unstoppable  
'cause we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
  
Feed your head with all the things you need  
When you're hungry  
Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday  
'cause they'll put words into my mouth  
  
They're making me feel so ashamed  
Making me taking the blame  
Making me cold in the night  
Making me question my heart and my soul  
And I think that it's not quite right  
  
Hey ! Stay young and invincible !  
'cause we know just what we are  
And come what may we're unstoppable  
'cause we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
Yeah we know just what we are  
  
Hey ! Stay young and invincible !  
'cause we know just what we are  
And come what may we're unstoppable  
'cause we know just what we are  
And hey ! Stay young and invincible !  
'cause we know just what we are  
And come what may my faith's unshakeable  
'cause we know just what we are  
'cause we know just what we are  
'cause we know just what we are  
'cause we know just what we are  
'cause we know just what we are  
Know just what we are  
Know just what we are  
Know just what we are  
Know just what we are
