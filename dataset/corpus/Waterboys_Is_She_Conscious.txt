Is she really wide awake  
Is she conscious  
Of her beautiful mistake  
Is she conscious  
As she moves among the crowd  
  
She's got the world upon a piece of string  
She's got the world upon a piece of string, it's so  
He was ugly and she was beautiful  
He was ugly and she was so...  
  
Is she conscious  
Is she asleep or just afloat  
Is she conscious  
Of the letter that she wrote  
Is she conscious  
Of the muzak in her ears  
  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes, it's so  
He was ugly and she was beautiful  
He was ugly and she was so...  
  
Is she conscious  
As she sways across the room  
Is she conscious  
Of the weeping of the moon  
Is she conscious  
As she leaves the door ajar  
Is she conscious  
As she gets into the car  
  
I don't even want to say her name  
I don't even want to say her name, that's all  
I want to sing it from the toppest top  
I want to sing it from the toppest top, that's all  
  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes, it's so  
He was ugly and she was beautiful  
He was ugly and she was so...  
  
Is she conscious  
Of the chauffeur as he drives  
Is she conscious  
As the ambulance arrives
