Always strapped when I hit the club  
Niggas give me that bitches give me hugs  
And since I'm paid niggas be muggin' me  
You know I'm muggin' back niggaz be muggin'  
Me you know I'm muggin' back  
  
Yes sir  
Check me out hod' up  
26 inches bitch was sittin' croocked.  
Old school chevy' faster den a silver bullet.  
Strawberry paint seats vanilla puddin' 2 bitches goin' at each others pussy.  
Top chopped sent the car to a barbershop.  
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot.  
I'm so unorthodox I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shox.  
(Bounce bitch bounce bounce)  
I'm the hottest shit jumping out the coffe pot man I'm just tryin'  
To get my spot like a polka dot. Lil' cush make my eyes and my shoulders drop,  
Lil syrup and I can make the soda pop, keep talking and I can make my soldiers
pop,  
Real niggas ridin' wit me till the motor' stop, I got these hoes straight
livin'  
Out the soap op. I got a couple like a coat on. (OK)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Always strapped when I hit the club  
Niggas give me dat bitches give me hugs  
And since I'm paid bitches be lovin' me  
They know I love em' back bitches be lovin' me they know I love em' back  
  
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blazed,  
Put the chop and the pussy in the driveway.  
Bet the house on the youngen and we got paid.  
Triple colors on the bikes and the new Mercedes'  
Bustin keys on they ass while we got paid.  
But my tens ridin' hot to an open bay,  
Uptown made man out the hard way crap in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way.  
(like father like son)  
Ball till' ya fall stunting with them paper plates,  
Throw hundreds on them hoes while we eating stakes.  
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday.  
We grind for the shine nigga getting' big money.  
Got a fleet tossin' chicken nigga get cake,  
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface.  
I'm in the impala dropped top chawnky ice man birdman rockin' red monkeys  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Always strapped when I hit the club  
Niggas give me that bitches give me hugs  
And since I'm paid bitches be lovin' me  
They know I love em' back bitches be lovin' me they know I love em' back
