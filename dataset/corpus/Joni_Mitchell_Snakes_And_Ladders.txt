He  
In a shopping mall  
Finally met the perfect girl  
She is all that matters  
The only one in all the world  
Like a Barbie doll  
Oh love is snakes and ladders  
Snakes and ladders  
  
She  
Just to have and hold  
Is the perfect air-brushed angel  
Makes you hot just looking at her  
Stapled into all his braincells  
Like a centerfold  
Oh love is snakes and ladders  
Snakes and ladders  
  
Get to the top and slide back down  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Buy the townhouse  
Call the preacher  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Get to the top and slide back down  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Set up credit for the lovely creature  
The lovely creature  
  
He  
On a corporate climb  
Set his sights on power for her  
On a silver platter  
He gave up happy hour for her  
Perrier and lime  
Oh love is snakes and ladders  
Snakes and ladders  
She  
In a handsome world  
Put her mind to social graces  
All the privileged chatter  
Setting pretty table places  
For the girls in pearls  
Oh love is snakes and ladders  
Snakes and ladders  
  
Get to the top and slide back down  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Buy the carphone,  
Call the broker  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Get to the top and slide back down  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Buy the wife a diamond choker  
A diamond choker  
  
True love, true love, true love  
He's so nervous  
New love, new love, new love  
When he's with her  
Oh, he's wasting away  
True love, true love, true love  
It's so curious  
New love, new love, new love  
Just to kiss her  
To kiss her, to kiss her, to kiss her  
To kiss her, to kiss her, to kiss her  
To kiss her he has to shave  
  
She  
In the gilded mirrors  
In the swing of fancy places  
Where the black ties flatter  
Started seeing other faces  
Young-fogie-financiers  
Oh love is snakes and ladders  
Snakes and ladders  
  
See  
In the crimes of time  
How the seasons steal away  
How the rungs are shattered  
First you're green then you're grey  
Still the snakes unwind  
Still playin' snakes and ladders  
Snakes and ladders  
  
Get to the top and slide back down  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Sell the vineyard  
Call the lawyer  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Get to the top and slide back down  
Get to the bottom climb back up  
Gather garbage to destroy her  
To destroy her  
  
Ladders, ladders, ladders  
The perfect girl  
Ladders, ladders, ladders  
The paper chase Love is snakes and ladders  
Ladders, ladders, ladders  
The social whirl  
Ladders, ladders  
The rat race  
Barbie doll
