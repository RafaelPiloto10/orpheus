One look and I'm done  
One glance from your eyes  
And I'm captivated  
  
The taste of your skin  
The warmth of your hungry lips  
Has me so taken and I  
Love the way you can make me dance  
From miles away  
  
When I'm with you I'm so sedated  
I'm captivated by you  
  
You're just like the wind 'cuz  
Everything moves away when you're around it  
  
The sun is just like the sound of  
your voice in the morning  
When you light my world up and I  
Love the way you can make me dance From miles away  
  
When I'm with you I'm never jaded,  
I'm captivated  
  
Oh,  
I'll never stop believing  
In this crazy love we're leading  
Oh, sugar,  
Hold me closer,  
Make me sweeter,  
I need ya,  
I love you  
  
So, please, show me that smile  
Make me laugh for just a little while  
Then breathe me one breath  
I only need one to fill the emptiness  
  
Love the way you can make me dance  
From miles away  
It's been so long but now,  
I've waited and I'm captivated
