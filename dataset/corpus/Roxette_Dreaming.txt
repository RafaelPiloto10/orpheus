Hot summer night.  
The art of make-believe.  
The treasure behind closed doors.  
The hunter behind the trees  
Radiowaves thru the air.  
Can you hear me calling?  
Oh I've been dreaming.  
Dreaming.  
Dreaming of a woman in white.  
The sound from the street.  
The smell of sweet perfume.  
My breath inside of you hits an electric room  
Radiowaves thru the air.  
Can you hear me calling?  
Oh I've been dreaming.  
Dreaming.  
Dreaming of a woman in white.
