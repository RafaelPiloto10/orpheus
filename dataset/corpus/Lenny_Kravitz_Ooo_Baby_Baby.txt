I did you wrong  
My heart went out to play  
But in the game I lost yyou  
What a price to pay  
  
  
I'm cryin'  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
  
Mistakes I know I made a few  
But I'm only human  
You make mistakes too  
  
I'm cryin'  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
  
But I guess I'm trying  
I can't give up hope  
Cause it ain't a day  
That I hold you in  
A whisper: I still love you  
  
Until that day  
I'm cryin'  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo my baby baby  
  
I wanna be by your side  
Day and night  
I'll never leave you, never leave you  
  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby  
Ooo baby baby
