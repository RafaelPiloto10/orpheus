Evil in my head, in my head, inside this private hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
  
Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way  
Day after day, day after day, day after  
  
Demons in my head, in my head, inside this private hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell  
I'm not feeling very well  
  
Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way  
Day after day, day after day, day after  
  
Do do do do  
Mental  
Hell mental  
Hell mental
