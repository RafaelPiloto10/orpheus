When will it make a sound  
The sound... I desire  
  
'Cause we all need something to do  
A certain something... That's true  
  
Floating upstream I've seen  
The spider and the snake  
A trip without pause when  
I saw... My mistake  
  
'Cause we all need something to do  
A certain something... That's true  
  
All my life... I have known who I am  
A troubled man but I stand  
  
All my life I have seen what ir means  
To be myself in this dream  
  
'Cause we all need something to do  
A certain someone... That's you
