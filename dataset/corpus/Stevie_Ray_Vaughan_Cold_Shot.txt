Once was a sweet thang baby, held our love in our hands  
Now I reach to kiss your lips, the touch don't mean a thing  
And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag.  
A cold shot baby, I let our love go bad  
  
Remember the way that you loved me, do anything I say  
Now I see you out somewhere, you won't give me the time of day  
And that's a cold shot darlin', yeah that's a drag  
That's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad  
  
I really meant I was sorry, for ever causin' you pain  
You showed your appreciation, by walkin' out anyway  
And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag  
That's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad  
  
Don't let our true love run cold baby
