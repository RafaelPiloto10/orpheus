An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day  
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost herd in the sky  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat  
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet  
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name  
"If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range"  
"Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride"  
"A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies."  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
Ghost riders in the sky
