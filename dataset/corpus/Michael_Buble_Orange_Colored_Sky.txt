I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Now out of the blue my dreams come true  
When they ask I'll tell them why  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When out of an orange colored sky  
Flash,bang, alakazam  
Wonderful you came by  
  
I was humming a tune  
Drinking in sunshine  
When out of an orange colored view  
Wham,baam, alakazam  
I got a look at you  
  
One look and I yell timber  
Watch out for flying glass  
  
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
I've been hit,this is it,this is it
