Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis  
  
So far apart, I check that the coast was clear,  
I feel like a post card,  
I wish you were here  
Subway through the dark, tearing through the park  
Taxi down the street, the avenue's at my feet  
Don't matter much to me  
What it is that I do  
As long as I'm coming home With you  
  
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see,  
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me  
Like a high jacked plane,  
Or a runaway train,  
Or a speeding bullet,  
There's no stopping this!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
  
A thousand miles feels like a million years,  
Like hundreds of postcards  
That say I wish you were here!  
Airplane through the sky, grey all racing by,  
Air bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea,  
Don't matter much to me  
What it is that I do,  
As long as I'm coming home with you  
  
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see,  
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me  
Like a high jacked plane,  
Or a runaway train,  
Or a speeding bullet,  
There's no stopping this!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
  
Like a high jacked plane,  
Or a runaway train,  
Or a speeding bullet,  
There's no stopping this!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis
