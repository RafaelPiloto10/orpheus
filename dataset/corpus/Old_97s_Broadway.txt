In a hotel room just off Times Square it's like a closet  
I can watch the dancing class go round  
But in a hotel room that costs as much as my apartment  
I can watch the working class go down  
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight  
Broadway, Broadway  
In a hotel room just off Times Square they made a monster  
He was unaware of what went down  
Fattening him up just like calf before a slaughter  
But he'd had his fill of hollow town  
And it's enough to make a stupid man think straight  
Broadway, Broadway  
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight  
Broadway, Broadway, Broadway, Broadway
