I've tried so hard  
You know I can't do more  
It's the turn of the card  
It's the close of the door  
  
The lies you told  
You know they hurt so deep  
So I'll go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
  
And day after day  
You've been treating me bad  
Friends come up and say,  
Why do you take all that?  
  
'Cause it's making me moan  
And it's making me weep  
So I'll go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
  
You play at love  
Like a child plays games  
One day I'm in  
Then I'm out again  
  
You change the rules  
And I just can't win  
You've broken me now  
So I give in, yeah, yeah  
I've been through worse  
  
But I don't know what  
Oh, I gave to you  
Everything that I got  
So take this heart  
Or what's left to keep  
  
And I'll go home  
And cry myself to sleep  
So I'll go home and cry myself to sleep  
Cry myself to sleep
