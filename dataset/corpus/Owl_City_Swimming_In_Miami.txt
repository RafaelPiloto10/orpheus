I'm alone above the atmosphere  
And no one looking up can find me here  
'Cause I can close my eyes, and disappear  
When I climb the stairs, to watch the sun  
Above the station walls, the colors run  
To fill the swimming pool, when I am done  
  
I am the captain of an oil tanker that travels through your veins  
  
When the satellites hang all around  
And I can finally hear the lovely sound  
When all the engines in the back room die down  
All the airships move across the sky  
And my equipment just keeps standing by  
The planets glow, and intensify  
  
I am the pilot of a cargo airplane that travels through your veins  
  
When you are lying half asleep in your room  
Unaware if it is midnight, or afternoon  
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell  
It could be raining, but then you can never tell  
  
If you're alone in this awful downpour  
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door  
  
In the evening light, the boulevard  
Conceals the night, with disregard  
For all the workers in a west coast shipyard  
When I rearrange, the silverware  
And re-install the lights, in captain's chair  
I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air  
  
I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travel through your veins  
  
When you are lying half asleep in your room  
Unaware if it is midnight, or afternoon  
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell  
It could be raining, but then you can never tell  
  
If you're awake in this awful downpour  
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door  
When you are swimming in Miami at night  
And all around you in the traffic and city lights
