Lady Dolphin and her dolphin beau  
Were swimming out to sea one day  
All the other lady dolphins smiled  
But they were smiling in that subtle dolphin way  
  
So they pretended that they'd pay it no mind  
But she was female, of the jealous kind  
She couldn't stand it - not to ask him why  
She could see that he was flattered by the twinkle in his eye  
  
She said, "How much do you need me?  
How much do you need me?  
Would you stay with me till this ocean floor is dry?  
But if you cannot find the words that say  
I'm the only one you love that way  
I guess we'll have to say goodbye."  
  
He said, "My love for you is wider than the wide Sargasso Sea  
There ain't no bigger number, I know, but  
I never counted every ripple on the sea."  
  
He said that words had never failed him yet  
"But before our future course is set  
I have to find a way to win you, dear  
But there's two atmospheres of pressure on me here"  
  
"How much do I need you? How much do I need you?  
Can't seem to find the words to make you stay  
But remember all the things I've said  
That I'll love you till the day I'm dead  
'Cause I need you like this hole in my head  
I need you like this hole in my head
