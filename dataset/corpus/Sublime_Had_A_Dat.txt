Raging and swirling,  
Getting inside,  
I feel like I'm going to break!  
  
Bright sun sinking low,  
I never feel afraid to let emotions show.  
Well I did.  
Now take a look at me,  
I had a close brush before your destiny.  
  
Before I end, and you'll be victims of  
My stories, tales, lies, and exaggerations.  
I'm gonna  
When your living life like a show  
You gotta  
Take a bow to the people you know  
  
I said lie, for me  
Lying under a process tree  
Oh engrossing in my brain  
Feeling like I'm going a little insane.  
  
A little close inside  
Feels like I'm going insane!  
  
Red lights  
Are sinking low  
  
I grab another beer cuz it's time to go  
  
I feel my head burst, I head out to your car  
And I pray to Jesus Christ, but you won't get too far  
  
I say uh, headlights and uh second gear  
I run the road of like and skip the things you fear  
I said that you might, that you might find a better way  
To justify the evil things that you say  
  
Ah, help me please, ah help me please  
Because I'm going upon my knees  
  
I said, I said  
Going down to my knees  
I pray to the Lord up above!  
  
Help me,  
I'm falling down  
Feeling now the cold, cold, cold, hard ground  
  
Haunting faces, and moving lines  
Slumber party for tonight  
  
Pound it hard, your gonna pound it again  
But please just do not pump up my friend  
Cuz it seems all right, gonna push him around  
But I can't be taken for no clown.  
  
Because,  
When I am on the ground I cry!  
  
Wowowowowowo, dub style!  
  
Oh, cool and easy  
Oh no  
Cool and easy  
To the sweet reggae music  
Oh no  
Feels all right to sweet reggae music  
Feels all right  
Sweet reggae music
