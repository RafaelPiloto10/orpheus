All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know...  
You're not with me.  
Some can shine,  
Some can fly,  
Some are glorious,  
Some are ancient.  
Some are wise,  
Some are strong,  
Some are everything  
You could dream of.  
Some are clouds,  
Some are rain,  
Float like angel wings  
On an ocean.  
Some can sing  
Songs of Gods,  
Words so beautiful  
They fall like raindrops.  
Fall like raindrops.  
Fall like raindrops.  
But none are like me,  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know is you're not with me.  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know is you're not with me.  
Some will cry,  
Cry for you,  
Take your pain away  
When you're sleeping.  
Some will die,  
In your name,  
Give their soul to you  
For safe keeping.  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know...  
All I know is that you're not with me,  
Like me. (x3)  
All I know is that you're not with me.  
You're not with me. (x4)
