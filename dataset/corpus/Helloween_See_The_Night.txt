Born into a neighborhood that ain't exactly rich  
Never knew his father and his mother was a bitch  
Oh no  
Didn't have a place to go  
  
Grown up in the streets  
He learned to take just what he needs  
Violence and crime the only answer he believes  
Oh no  
Your emotions you don't show  
  
How can you ever give up  
When you never were scared?  
How can you ever forgive  
Without learning to blame?  
  
See the night  
That's where you're living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After you're gone  
  
Unemployed and full of hate  
You're dealing with cocaine  
One day you will end up with a needle in your brain  
Oh no  
As you slowly go insane  
  
How can you ever be good  
When you don't see a reason?  
How can you trust an old friend  
When you don't even care for one?  
  
See the night  
That's where you're living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After you're gone  
  
All you know is what you see  
You see society is treating you bad  
No more visions, no more hope  
Your future is a cold, cold cell  
I send you to hell  
  
Falling so deep into darkness  
Crawling so deep in the dark  
Give me a chance to regret what I've done  
Only if I can explain  
  
See the night  
That's where you're living  
Feel the dark  
That seems to follow you  
See the stars  
I see you crying  
See the stars  
You wished that one of them just shines for you  
After you're gone
