Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings  
Of the bluebird as she sings.  
The six o'clock alarm would never ring.  
But it rings and I rise,  
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes.  
The shavin' razor's cold and it stings.  
  
Cheer up, sleepy jean.  
Oh, what can it mean.  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen.  
  
You once thought of me  
As a white knight on a steed.  
Now you know how happy I can be.  
Oh, and our good times start and end  
Without dollar one to spend.  
But how much, baby, do we really need.  
  
Cheer up, sleepy jean.  
Oh, what can it mean.  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen.  
Cheer up, sleepy jean.  
Oh, what can it mean.  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen.  
  
Cheer up, sleepy jean.  
Oh, what can it mean.  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen.
