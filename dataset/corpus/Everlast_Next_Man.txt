Aha  
'And there, but for the grace of God, go I'  
It's kinda neat  
I wonder what it means  
  
I rock a jam for love  
I quit my band for love  
I'll smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love  
Make you cry like a dove  
Leave you standin' alone  
In a world so cold  
Watch the drama unfold  
'Cause you sell your soul  
Now you're fearin' your death  
Sniffin' crystal meth 'till there ain't none left  
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it  
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted  
You probably won't admit it  
So you start to sink lower  
You're caught in the flood  
And you're tryin' to find Noah  
If you hungry and your near me yo, you gonna get fed  
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay your head  
Then come take my bed  
I'll sleep on the floor  
'Cause these are the times that friends are for  
  
Chorus (X2)  
I see everybody out here doin' for self  
And they don't give a damn on the next man  
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health  
I can't wait 'till you the next man  
  
I get uptight for love  
You know I'll fight for love  
I might keep my wifey up all night for love  
And when the daylight comes  
I be seein' mad bums  
With no shoes on their feet  
Plus nothin' to eat  
I can't save the whole street  
So I feel like I'm beat  
And why play the game when nothin' goin' to change  
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans  
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend  
Tryin' to keep my dean  
I try to give to the poor  
Tryin' to get through this life  
And get through that door  
I'm all up in this mix  
For these final tics  
Goin' all the way to seven  
And it's half past six  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
I pray to God for love  
I'll make Jihad for love  
And I just might pull your freakin' card for love  
Make you sing 'Hey Love' like my man King Son  
I freak the art noise  
Over all you toys  
Better bring your boys  
Summon all your crew  
No matter what you do  
It's comin' back on you  
Just like a planet orbits  
Let your sponge absorb it  
It's logical conclusion  
It's b-boy fusion  
And confusion say that he want control  
Of your mentality  
Your body and your soul  
So if you lose your whole  
Come and take my hand  
And link up this jam  
'Cause money that's the plan  
Tryin' to get through this maze  
Not to win this race  
We either ridin' on our horse  
Or walkin' on our face  
So come take your place on the side of love  
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
Can't wait 'till you the next man  
Can't wait 'till you the next man...
