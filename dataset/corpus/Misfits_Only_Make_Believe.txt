People see us everywhere  
They think you really care  
But myself I can't deceive  
I know it's only make believe.  
  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care,  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you.  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe.  
  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I'd give for you,  
My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything.  
My heart I can't control, you rule my very soul,  
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe.  
  
My one and only prayer, is that some day you'll care,  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My prayer, my hope, and my schemes, you are my every dream  
But it's only make believe
