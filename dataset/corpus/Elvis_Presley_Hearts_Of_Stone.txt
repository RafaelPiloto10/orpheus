Hearts made of stone will never brake  
'Cause the love you have for them, they just won't take it  
You can ask and plea, please, please, please break  
And all your love is there to stay  
  
These hearts of stone will cause you pain  
Although you love there has stopped just the same  
You can ask and plea, please, please, please break  
And all your love is there to stay  
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
You daddy know, I thought you knew, hearts are made of stone  
  
Hearts made of stone will never brake  
'Cause the love you have for them, they just won't take it  
You can ask and plea, please, please, please break  
And all your love is there to stay  
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
You daddy know, I thought you knew hearts are made of stone
