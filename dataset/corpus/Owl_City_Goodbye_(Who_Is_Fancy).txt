[Intro]  
I was a hot mess  
In my Sunday best  
Black tears in my eyes  
You were my first love  
You were my only one  
I can't believe your lies  
  
[Bridge]  
Once we were like bottle rockets  
Now I know I have to stop it  
  
Please believe me  
This isn't easy  
I just need to say goodbye  
  
[Refrain]  
Goodbye (2x)  
Losin' my mind  
Goodbye  
  
[Verse]  
You got a new friend  
You like to play pretend  
I'm just keepin' my cool  
Turn on the smoke machine  
Magic and make believe  
She'll never know you like I do  
  
[Bridge]  
Once we were a fire burnin'  
Now you're just a lesson I'm learning  
  
Please believe me  
This isn't easy  
I just need to say goodbye  
  
[Refrain]  
Goodbye (2x)  
Losin' my mind  
Goodbye  
  
[Interlude]  
I know that I can find somebody  
You won't ever find nobody else like me  
(4x)  
  
[Bridge]  
Once we were like bottle rockets  
Now I know I have to stop it  
  
Please believe me  
This isn't easy  
I just need to say goodbye  
  
[Refrain]  
Goodbye (2x)  
Losin' my mind  
Goodbye  
  
[Outro]  
I gotta say goodbye  
This isn't easy  
I gotta say goodbye
