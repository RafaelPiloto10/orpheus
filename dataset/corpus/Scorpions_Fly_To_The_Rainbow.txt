Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,  
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,  
Gliding through this life, and another is a child,  
And we're doing games, and losing things,  
Always playing gigs.  
  
Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,  
Where the sun is shining, in the night.  
I am in disgrace, yet I see a smiling face,  
And I hope you let me, share your place.  
I don't live today.  
  
Rain in the sky , make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
  
Rain in the sky , make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
  
Rain in the sky , make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
  
Well, I lived in magic solitude  
Of cloudy-looking mountains  
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops  
Roaming through Space ten thousand years ago  
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis  
Sinking to eternal waves of darkness  
  
Somewhere in the blue distance  
Are those long-forgotten trees of yore  
A broken violin floating alone in December  
Darkness everywhere and nothing more.  
  
Symbol, strange Symbol, Melancholy  
Painting torrid colors to a sky of green  
Candle breathing one night only  
Far away, in chillness, bleak, unseen  
  
Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow,  
Sails rigged to catch and kill the Time  
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow  
To call the Thing  
Sublime!
