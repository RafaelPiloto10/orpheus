Been traveling around some  
Crossing people's paths  
Some they stand right in your way  
Others like to watch you pass  
Been trying to memorize  
All the different lies  
That people must tell themselves each night to justify their lives  
  
Don't call it nothing  
This might be all we'll ever have  
  
Held myself for ransom  
Wandered so blind  
I found the roads less travelled  
To take you off my mind  
And I told myself I know  
Everything I do  
I'm just looking for something  
To lead me away from you  
  
Don't call it nothing  
This might be all you'll ever have  
  
I know it's not enough  
To make it sound like more  
So I swear if there's a God  
To make him sleep on the floor  
  
Been travelling around some  
Crossing people's paths  
Some they stand right in your way  
Others like to watch you pass  
  
Don't call it nothing  
This might be all we'll ever have  
I'll ever have ever have
