I'm on the white cliffs of Dover  
Thinking it over and over  
But if I jump its all over  
A cautionary tale for you  
I'd like to roll in the clover  
With you over and over  
On the white cliffs of Dover  
And then I'd let you push me over  
  
[Chorus]  
And if that is the fact  
Then in actual fact it's  
Not where it's at  
And it's over  
And if that is the fact  
Then in actual fact it's  
Not where it's at  
And it's over  
Yes it is  
  
And now the bluebirds are over  
Over the white cliffs of Dover  
So when you push me over  
Don't bury me I'm not worth anything  
  
[Chorus]
