In Mullingar, Westmeath born and raised  
At Nando's, is where I spent most of my days  
Chilling out, Maxing, Relaxing all cool then I go eat  
Some chicken outside the school.  
When a couple of chavs, they were up to no good  
They started making trouble in my neighborhood.  
I got in one little fight and my mom started objectin'  
She said "Your moving to London and joining one direction.  
I made it through auditions, thanks to Katy Perry  
And that's where I met Lou, Zayn, Liam, and Harry.  
And now who would've thought that we've come this far!  
I'm sure as hell not going back to Mullingar.
