Does it hurt to be polite  
Or is it just cool to be unkind  
Must you always hurt the ones you love  
And then get paid back in time  
Now, now, now  
Andy is fine but his taste is not mine  
Let me tell you I don't mean maybe  
I'm getting really tired of andy's babies  
Some say that children should be seen and not heard  
That's what i'd preferred  
Let's go downtown for a wine  
I'm sure you'll be forced to smile  
When you see andy's babies  
And the bohemian lifestyle  
Now, now now  
Andy's a saint  
But i'm loosing my patience  
I really don't mean maybe  
Don't even wanna talk about andy's babies  
So andy says his children will inherit the earth  
Isn't that absurd, in a word  
Trudy's in the bathroom  
She's trying to clean up her eyes  
And donald's gone to mass  
Yes we are thankful for that  
It's eight in the morning  
And still you can't get no sleep  
On account of this perfect day and  
All this white light white heat  
Ah, isn't that sweet
