You come home late and you come home early  
You come on big when you're feeling small  
You come home straight and you come home curly  
Sometimes you don't come home at all  
  
Chorus:  
So what in the world's come over you  
And what in heaven's name have you done  
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness  
You're out there running just to be on the run  
  
Well I got a heart that burns with a fever  
And I got a worried and a jealous mind  
How can a love that'll last forever  
Get left so far behind  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow  
It's crossed the evil line today  
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow  
We ain't got one word to say  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
  
Ending:  
You're out there running just to be on the run  
You're out there running just to be on the run  
You're out there running just to be on the run
