I see how you're tryin' to weasel  
Your way in and boy I know how  
You maneuver with your  
Your confusion  
  
You tell me that I'm your only  
And how bad that you want me  
Then why are you so shady  
If I'm supposed to be your lady  
  
Why should I believe anything you say  
And how could you shame me that way  
Tell me where, where'd you get the nerve  
To even think I'd do you could play me for  
  
[Chorus]  
You thought we didn't know  
You thought we were in the dark  
But boy your cover's blown  
'Cause we both know now, oh no  
You thought you had us both  
At your beckon call  
But now who's the joke  
And look who's laughing now  
  
Now you're trying to use us  
Against one another but it won't work  
I see right through your game boy  
And I know exactly where the blame falls  
  
You, you try to deny all your actions  
For once in your life be a real man  
At least give me the proper respect of the truth  
I already know you did it  
  
Why should I believe anything you say  
And how could you treat me that way  
Where'd you get the nerve to even think that you  
You could play me boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I see right through you baby  
You try to tell me you want me  
Can't you just get it through your thick head  
'Cause I have seen this game before and  
Now I'm showing you the door so  
Shut your mouth I'm night tryin' to hear your lies again  
  
Sorry you couldn't be a better man  
  
[Chorus]
