Is it wrong wanting you  
Wanting you as I do?  
Then my one sin in life  
Is wanting you  
  
Is it wrong to desire  
Lips that set me on fire?  
Then my one sin in life  
Is wanting you  
  
You're my temptation  
My heaven, my bliss  
I never knew love  
Could thrill me like this  
  
So, if it's wrong loving you  
Heart and soul as I do  
Then my one sin in life  
Is loving you  
  
You're my temptation  
My heaven, my bliss  
I never knew love  
Could thrill be like this  
  
So, if it's wrong loving you  
Heart and soul as I do  
Then my one sin in life  
Is loving you
