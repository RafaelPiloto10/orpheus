Why is it that civilized humanity  
Can make the world so wrong ?  
In this hurly-burly of insanity  
Our dreams cannot last long.  
  
We've reached a deadline,  
A press headline,  
Every sorrow.  
Blues value  
Is news value  
Tomorrow.  
  
Blues  
Twentieth century blues  
Are getting me down.  
Blues  
Escape those weary  
Twentieth century blues.  
  
Why,  
If there's a God in the sky,  
Why shouldn't He grin  
High  
Above this dreary  
Twentieth century din ?  
  
In this strange illusion,  
Chaos and confusion,  
People seem to lose their way.  
What is there to strive for,  
Love or keep alive for,  
Say, 'Hey, hey!'  
Call it a day ?  
  
Blues  
Nothing to win or to lose,  
It's getting me down.  
Blues  
Escape those weary  
Twentieth century blues.  
  
We've reached a deadline,  
A press headline,  
Every sorrow.  
Blues value  
Is news value  
Tomorrow.  
  
Blues  
Nothing to win or to lose,  
It's getting me down.  
Blues  
Escape those dreary  
Twentieth century  
Blues.
