Jam Blues Man  
  
There you lay  
All by yourself  
So please allow me  
To introduce myself  
  
I welcome you  
To the house of sin  
Open your mind  
And let the games begin  
  
I'm your lust  
And I'm your greed  
I'm every sick thought  
That you ever done dreamed  
  
Eaten your cake  
Now you want some more  
Mmm, where have I  
Heard that before?  
  
[Chorus]  
I am your  
I am your  
I'm just your sexual thing  
I am your  
I am your  
I'm just your sexual  
Ain't nothin' but a sexual  
It's just a sexual thing  
  
Lyin' there  
You look so horny  
Talk is cheap  
And startin' to bore me  
  
Hold me close  
And tell me it feels so good  
But damn, girl  
You knew it would  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Glad to have met you  
So pleased that you've come  
But I must be movin' on  
My work here is done  
  
Best believe me you, child  
The pleasure's been all mine  
If you're in need, please do indeed  
Call me anytime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They've got you medicated  
It's got you so frustrated  
  
He caught you masturbatin'  
You rather be fornicating  
  
Well then you come with me  
I'm gonna set you free  
  
It's just a sexual  
Ain't nothin' but a sexual  
It's just a sexual thing  
  
What you've witnessed is a sexual fantasy  
Please do not try these tricks at home
