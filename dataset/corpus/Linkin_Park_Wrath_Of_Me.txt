Chorus 1  
  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
(I see you runnin, I see u're scared)  
  
Chorus 2  
  
You will feel..  
The wrath of me..  
Can you see..  
What I want you 2 be..  
  
[verse]  
I can't see  
(its blinding)  
Ur love  
(used to be so blinding)  
But now all I feel  
(is the fading taste)  
Of ur opinion  
(the theory that used to be)  
But now stuck in the vibe  
(is my heart..)  
  
You will feel..  
The wrath of me..  
Can you see..  
What I want you 2 be..  
You will feel..  
The wrath of me..  
Can you see..  
What I want you 2 be..  
  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
(I see you runnin, I see u're scared)  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
(I see you runnin, I see u're scared)  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
(I see you runnin, I see u're scared)  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
(everyone screamin', everyone yellin')  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
(I see you runnin, I see u're scared)  
  
You will feel..  
The wrath of me..  
Can you see..  
What I want you 2 be..  
You will feel..  
The wrath of me..  
Can you see..  
What I want you 2 be..
