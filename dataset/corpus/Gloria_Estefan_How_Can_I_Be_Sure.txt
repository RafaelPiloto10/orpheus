How can I be sure  
In a world tha's constantly changing  
How can I be sure  
Where I stand with you  
  
Whenever I...  
Whenever I'm away from you  
I wanna die  
'Cause you know I wanna stay with you  
  
How do I know  
Maybe you're trying to use me  
Flying too high can confuse me  
Touch me, but don't take me down  
  
Whenever I...  
Whenever I'm away from you  
My alibi  
Is telling poeple I don't care for you  
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up  
Upside down  
It's a pity I can't seem to find  
Someone who's as pretty and lovely as you  
  
How can be sure  
I really, really, really want to know  
I really, really, really want to know  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
How's the weather  
Whether or not we're together  
Together we'll see it much better  
I love you, I love you forever  
You know where I can be found  
  
How can I be sure  
In a world that's constantly changing  
How can I be sure  
I'll be sure with you
