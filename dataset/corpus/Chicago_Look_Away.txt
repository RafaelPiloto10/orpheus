When you called me up this mornin'  
Told me 'bout the new love you found  
I said, "I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you"  
  
Found someone else  
I guess I won't be comin' 'round  
I guess it's over, baby  
It's really over baby, whoa  
  
And from what you said  
I know you've gotten over me  
It'll never be the way it used to be  
So if it's gotta be this way  
Don't worry baby, I can take the news, okay  
  
But if you see me walkin' by  
And the tears are in my eyes  
Look away, baby, look away  
  
If we meet on the streets someday  
And I don't know what to say  
Look away, baby, look away  
Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  
  
When we both agreed as lovers  
We were better off as friends  
That's how it had to be  
Yeah, that's how it had to be  
  
I tell you I'm fine  
But sometimes I just pretend  
Wish you were holdin' me  
Wish you were still holdin' me, whoa  
  
I just never thought  
That I would be replaced so soon  
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you  
I know I wanted to be free  
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be  
  
But if you see me walkin' by  
And the tears are in my eyes  
Look away, baby, look away  
  
And if we meet on the streets someday  
And I don't know what to say  
Look away, baby, look away  
Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  
  
If you see me walkin' by  
And the tears are in my eyes  
Look away, baby, look away  
  
And if we meet on the streets someday  
And I don't know what to say  
Look away, baby, look away  
Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  
  
If you see me walkin' by  
And the tears are in my eyes  
Look away, baby, look away  
Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  
  
When you called me up this mornin'  
Told me 'bout the new love you found  
I said, "I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you"
