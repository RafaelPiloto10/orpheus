Thought I was lookin' good  
So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood  
Was invited by a skinny girl  
Into her high class world  
  
Left my bicycle under the stairs  
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs  
Made my way across the crowded room  
I had nothing to lose  
  
My reception wasn't very keen  
So turning on a friendly grin,  
Stood on the table with my glass of gin  
And came straight to the point  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time  
  
I was glad to come  
I'll be sad to go  
So while I'm here  
I'll have me a real good time. Oh no  
  
Dancin' madly 'round the room, yeah  
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune  
Was escorted by a friendly slag  
'Round the ... back  
  
Wandered c-c-cross ...  
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.  
Said one word and was asked to leave  
Kinda' wish I was dead.  
  
I was glad to come  
And I'll be so sad to leave,  
But while I was here  
I had me a real good time, oooh.  
  
The skinny girl made it clear,  
That she only came here for the beer - that's a fact, oh yeah  
The vicar he simply reeked of gin - good God  
  
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle, good party  
Ooh hoo, ha ha, yeah  
  
I was glad to come, but I was also glad to get home, yeah  
Ooh hoo  
Hoo, get in there  
Ooh hoo
