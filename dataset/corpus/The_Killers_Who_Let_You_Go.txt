Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
  
I feel it inside, down in my soul  
And I just can't hide these things I know  
We could be friends  
And I promise that it won't go bad  
But hopefully this story ends  
But you ain't got nothing I never had  
So let's take it slow  
  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
  
Someone must have loved you  
Not the way that I do  
You're missing what I'm trying to say  
Ain't nothing getting in my way  
  
So tell me that's fantastic  
  
And promise me, you'll always try  
I find it so romantic  
When you look into my beautiful eyes  
And lose control  
  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
  
I don't know what it means  
But I've been wondering  
Who let you go?  
  
And honey, when you walk my way  
It makes me wanna say  
Ohhhh  
  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
Sh-la-la-la-la-la-la?
