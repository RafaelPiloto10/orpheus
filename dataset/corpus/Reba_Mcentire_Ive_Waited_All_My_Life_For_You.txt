Don't you know  
That you're the one  
I'd like to live my life through  
I can't see anyone with me but you  
  
I want to go where you go  
And share the things you do  
For I've waited all my life for you  
I've heard tales  
That true love comes  
Only once in a life time  
And this time is the last time for me  
For I just can't imagine  
Being in love with someone new  
'cause I've waited all my life for you  
  
So here it is  
All the love  
That I've saved for a lifetime  
Never touched  
Never crushed  
And never used  
And to think that I'd ever find you  
It's impossible but true  
'cause I've waited all my life for you  
Oh I just can't imagine  
Being in love with someone new  
'cause I've waited all my life for you
