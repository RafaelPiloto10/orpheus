(originally sung by the Beegees)  
  
There's a light, a very special light,  
Never ever shone on me.  
I would like my whole life to be,  
With someone like you...  
With someone... With someone like...  
  
You don't know what it's like,  
You don't know what it's like,  
To love somebody,  
To love somebody,  
The way I love you.  
  
There's a way, a very special way,  
To look at each and every single thing.  
Ah, but what good would that bring,  
If I ain't got you...  
If I ain't... If I ain't got you.  
  
You don't know what it's like,  
I don't think you really, really know what it's like,  
To love somebody,  
To love somebody,  
The way I love you,  
The way I love you.  
  
There's a light, a special kind of light,  
Never ever shone on me.  
I would like my whole life to be,  
With someone like you...  
With someone... With someone like...  
  
Baby, you don't know what it's like,  
You, you just don't know what it's like,  
To love somebody,  
To love somebody,  
The way I love you.  
  
You don't know what it's like,  
I don't think you really, really know what it's like,  
To love somebody,  
To love  
The way I love you.
