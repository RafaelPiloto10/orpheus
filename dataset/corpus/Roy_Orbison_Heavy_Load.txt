At times it seems too rough, things just drag me down  
It's hard to find the strength to just one more round  
When I need help, I know where to go  
'cause you're the best friend that I could ever know  
Being taught the words from you .... from what is true  
Someone to share the pain that I'm going through  
And it's a heavy load that I bear and it's a heavy crown that I wear  
As I travel down this road, it's a heavy load, it's a heavy load  
  
It's a heavy load that I bear and it's a heavy crown that I wear  
So help me one more time, it's such an uphill climb  
As I travel down this road, it's a heavy load  
Lord it's a heavy load, Lord it's a heavy load, Lord it's a heavy load  
Lord it's a heavy load, Lord it's a heavy load....
