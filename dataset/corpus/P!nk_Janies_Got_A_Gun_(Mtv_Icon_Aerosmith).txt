Honey what have you done?  
Dum dum dum, it's the sound, it's the sound  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her whole world's come undone  
From lookin' straight at the sun  
What did her daddy do?  
What did he put you through?  
They say when Janie was arrested  
They found him underneath a train  
But man, he had it comin'  
Now that Janie's got a gun  
She ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
Tell me now it's untrue  
What did her daddy do?  
He jacked a little bitty baby  
The man has got to be insane  
They say the spell that he was under  
The lightning and the thunder  
Knew that someone had to stop the rain  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
What did her daddy do?  
It was Janie's last I. O. You  
She had to take him down easy  
And put a bullet in his brain  
She said 'cause nobody believs me  
The man was such a sleaze, he ain't  
Never gonna be the same  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away
