It's tasty, it's like a cupcake  
It's cotton candy, it melts in your mouth  
And lately I been gettin' hunger pains  
When you lick your lips while you check me out  
  
Fast car, boring, girlfriend, boring  
Got money, boring, no, oh, oh, oh  
Hot friends, boring, rock band, boring  
Not interested, no, thank you  
  
If you want me you're gonna have to catch me  
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa  
And if you catch me you're gonna have to show me  
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa  
  
You're scrumptious, I kinda like it  
I'm indecisive, I change my mind a lot  
But you're hot  
(You're so hot)  
But I think you kinda know it  
Really hopin' you don't blow it, so bring it  
  
You're tired, boring, you're sore, boring  
You worked all day, boring, whoa-oa-oa-oa  
Big boat, boring  
Black amex, listening, six pack, well, heh  
  
If you want me you're gonna have to catch me  
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa  
And if you catch me you're gonna have to show me  
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa  
  
Whoa-oa-oa-oa  
  
If I let you catch me  
It's because I think you're really cute  
And if you don't get it right  
I'ma be like really, really mad  
  
Uh, insert rap here  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight  
Go, go, that's hot  
  
Whoa-oa-oa-oa  
If you want me you catch me, yeah, whoa-oa-oa-oa  
If you catch me you show me, yeah, whoa-oa-oa-oa  
  
If you want me you're gonna have to catch me  
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa  
And if you catch me you're gonna have to show me  
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa  
  
Fast car, boring, girlfriend, boring  
Got money, boring, whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Hot friends, boring, rock band, boring  
Not interested, whoa-oa-oa-oa
