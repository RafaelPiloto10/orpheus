Ya  
  
Uh huh  
  
[Chorus]  
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new heat  
Brand new car, brand new feet  
Brand new seats, brand new smell, put out the roach, light a brand new L  
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new  
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new  
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new  
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new  
  
I'm cold like a midnight in Aspen  
I am the president and the assassin  
Cameras, on big lights, action  
Welcome to the show, I am the main attraction  
Money in the mattress, money in the attic  
Money on my mind, money is my habit  
Stay on the grind until the money's automatic  
Bitch I love money I'm a fucking fanatic  
All day strapped grip tight, grasping  
Say what? Who me? Click-Clack, blast 'em  
Chrome 24's tires thin like napkins  
Gotta ride big cause I am like a captain  
You know I'm a boss, chillin', relaxin'  
Probably in my office, doin' my taxes  
You little niggas so not in my bracket,  
And I don't even have time to practice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got ice, ridiculous price  
Your camera has never saw a picture this nice (Hmm)  
I'm fishin' and the bitches will bite  
It's prolly cause my game is fixin' in tight, Right  
I'm fuckin' every bad bitch twice  
And if she doesn't wear panties then I'll fuck her on sight  
I'm nasty like spice  
I know what she likes  
I can make a black women scream like she white  
I can make a white women scream like Mike  
But before she start singin', she gotta check my Mic  
Niggas just hatin'  
And I dun lost sight  
It's like i don't see 'em I only see the night  
You talkin' that shit but you boys just hype  
I hope you bring a gun to the fight Aight?  
Louis V tennis shoes, big brown stripe  
You think you fresh, Nigga I'm ripe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Brand new coupe, drivin' crazy then the mother's  
Sittin' low in the seats with the burner sittin' under  
Got my tank top toppe on it  
Prolly ain't summer  
But I ride like that cause I'm hotter than the others  
Damn, there's no keepin' up with the brother man  
I can spell my name in burnt rubber  
I'm gone  
Leave me alone  
Now the dog is at supper  
You can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard  
I'm so far ahead of them suckers  
I'm gonna have to start rappin' in numbers  
I promise the flows don't stop they come rappin' like thunder  
I bet you hide under your covers haha  
  
[Chorus]
