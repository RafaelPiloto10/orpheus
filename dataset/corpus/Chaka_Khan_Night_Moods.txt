CHORUS:  
Night moods, I love your night moods  
Night moods, You've got the right moods  
When you're lying here beside me  
Ooh you take my breath away  
Baby I feel such love inside me  
I'm so glad you're going to stay  
Night moods, night moods  
Got a need as deep as a canyon  
I'm so glad I found my soul companion  
I love your night moods  
I'm in the right mood  
I love your night moods  
Night time is the right time  
Night time is the one time I'm loving you  
Loving you  
All day long I'm thinking of  
And I just can't wait 'til the sun goes down  
I can't help it, how I love it  
Count the moments 'til you come 'round  
Night moods, night moods  
Ain't no use in talkin' about it  
All I know is that I can't live without it  
I love your night moods  
I'm in the right mood  
I love your night moods  
Night time is the right time  
Right now is the one time I'm close to you  
Close to you  
Got a need as deep as a canyon  
I'm so glad I found my soul companion  
Night moods, I love your night moods  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)  
Night moods (I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it at night)
