I'm standing in the dock  
With my innocent hand on my heart  
I've changed my plea  
I've changed my plea to guilty  
Because freedom is wasted on me  
See how your rules spoil the game  
  
Outside there is a pain  
Emotional air raids exhausted my heart  
And it's safer to be inside  
So, I'm changing my plea  
And no one can dissuade me  
Because freedom was wasted on me  
See how your rules spoil the game  
  
Something I have learned  
If there is one thing in life I've observed  
It's that everybody's got somebody  
Ooh no, not me  
So I've changed my plea to guilty  
And reason and freedom is a waste  
It's a lot like life
