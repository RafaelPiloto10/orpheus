I told her I wouldn't miss her at all  
As she walked through the door  
I couldn't care less  
If she didn't care anymore  
And with tears in my eyes, I lied  
I was glad we were through  
As she drove away crying  
At the famous last words of a fool  
  
Famous last words of a fool  
Famous last words of a fool  
You won't break my heart  
And I don't love you  
Famous last words of a fool  
  
The first night without her would be easy  
I kept tellin' myself  
Although I'm dyin' at the thought of her lyin'  
Somewhere else  
There'll be nothin' to it  
I'll easily find someone new  
As my breaking heart echoes  
The famous last words of a fool  
  
Famous last words of a fool  
Famous last words of a fool  
You won't break my heart  
And I don't love you  
Famous last words of a fool  
  
You won't break my heart  
And I don't love you  
Famous last words of a fool
