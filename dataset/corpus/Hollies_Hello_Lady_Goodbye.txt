I woke up in the morning  
Heard a mockingbird sing  
Was he laughing at me?  
I went to the basin  
Washed the sleep out my eyes  
So I could see  
A note on the bed  
Close to where my lover should be  
She slipped away in the night  
The writing was shaky  
And with tears on the sheets  
I'm sorry we had a fight  
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell  
I'm sorry we never said goodbye  
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell  
Left with a tear in your eye  
Must've been brewing for a very long time  
In the wardrobe the hangers are bare  
Don't know how you did it  
It must've been planned  
You even took your favorite chair  
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye  
You won't find no tear in my eye  
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye  
Going out tonight to get high  
Found myself at Charlie's scene  
Drinking all fashions  
Sticky painted movie queen  
Winked her eye at me  
That's how it happened  
Diamond shoes, satin dress  
Flashin', flashin', flashin', flashin'  
Woke up in the morning  
Heard my mockingbird sing  
And it was singin' for me  
The lady I met last night's  
Here by my side  
She's good company  
Well, hello sweet lady, hello  
Good morning with a smile  
Well, hello sweet lady, hello  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
Lady, lady  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright
