Congratulations you have won  
It's a years subscription of bad puns.  
And it makes your story our concern  
And you set it up for returns

And there seems to be a problem here.  
Your state of emotion seems to clear.  
You rise and fall like wall street stock  
And you had an affect on our happy talk.  
  
Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x2)  
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x2)
