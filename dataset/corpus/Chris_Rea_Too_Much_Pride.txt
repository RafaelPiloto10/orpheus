Say good morning this is your lucky day  
Most of your problems they're gonna slip away  
Oh I'm gonna help you, I can show you the way  
So give me so time my friend and hear what I say  
  
You got too much pride, too much pride  
Drive yourself crazy, you got too much pride  
  
Take a look at the downside anyway that you choose  
Out here on the upside you ain't got nothing to lose  
Oh I'm gonna help you, I can show you the way  
So give me some time my friend and hear what I say  
  
You got too much pride, too much pride  
Drive yourself crazy, you got too much pride  
  
Too much pride it will drive you wild  
It will burn your soul, cut you deep inside  
Drag you down, get in your way  
So take a look my friend listen what I say  
  
You got too much pride, too much pride  
Drive yourself crazy, you got too much pride
