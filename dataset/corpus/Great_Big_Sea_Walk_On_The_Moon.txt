Is it just me, or a message from above?  
Bells are ringing, push has finally come to shove.  
The door before me now is open just enough.  
And I'm sick and tired of waiting for dreams that never come,  
And games I never played in, but still wish that I had won...  
I'm alive, I've got one shot and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step, this is my walk on the moon.  
Don't you think their hands were shaking as that rocket ship touched down?  
I'm sure they shivered when they finally touched the ground.  
And the giant leap so fragile that it hardly made a sound...  
But it must have been amazing what a world they got to see.  
So I don't care, my foolish fear won't get the best of me now  
I'm alive, I've got one shot and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step this is my walk on the moon.  
This is my walk on the moon.  
Oh it must have been amazing, what a world they got to see!  
So I don't care, my foolish fear won't get the best of me now...  
I'm alive, I've got one shot, and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon...  
I'm alive, I've got one shot, and I'm taking it to you.  
I'm alive, I've come to realize, not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step,  
This is my one small step,  
This is my walk on the moon.  
This is my walk on the moon.  
This is my walk on the moon.
