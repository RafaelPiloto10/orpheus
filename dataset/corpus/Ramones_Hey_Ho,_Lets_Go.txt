Hey Ho, Lets Go  
Hey Ho, Lets Go  
They're forming in a straight line  
They're goin through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
Blitzkreig Bop  
They're piling in the backseat  
They're generation steam heat  
Pulsating to the back seat  
Blitzkreig Bop  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
Shoot em' in the back now  
What they want, I don't know  
They're all reved up and ready to go  
They're forming in a straight line  
They're goin through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
Blitzkreig Bop  
They're piling in the backseat  
They're generation steam heat  
Pulsating to the back seat
