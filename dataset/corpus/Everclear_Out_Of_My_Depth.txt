Out of my depth  
Lost in the air  
Falling faster  
Like a broken elevator  
  
Out of my depth  
Lost in the dark  
Waiting for that other shoe  
To come down hard  
  
I cannot communicate  
Like I wish I could  
I do not deal with my problems  
Like I know I should  
  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my league  
Watching everything  
Just slip away from me  
  
Something bad is going to happen  
I can feel it deep inside  
There are shadows all around me  
Like a bad moon on the rise  
  
I am in over my head  
I am in too deep here  
Over my head  
I guess I should keep my opinions to myself  
I guess I am out of my depth  
  
Out of my depth  
Right from the start  
I feel like I was born  
With an invisible heart  
Out of my depth  
Seems like everyday  
I can't find the words  
To make the good things come my way  
  
Yes, I feel like I am faking it  
I feel like I am wrong  
I feel like I'm a guest  
Like I just do not belong  
  
I am out of my depth  
Every single day  
I just cannot find the words  
To make my monsters go away  
  
Something bad is going to happen  
I can feel it deep inside  
There are shadows all around me  
Like a bad moon on the rise  
  
I am in too deep here  
Over my head  
Yes, I am in too deep here  
Over my head  
I should seek some professional help  
Because I'm out of my depth  
Yes, I am out of my depth  
And I am slowly going out of my mind  
  
Oh, go away  
Make them go away  
Someday I know  
I will make them go away  
Make them go away  
Make them go away  
Someday I know I will  
Make my monsters go away  
  
I am in over my head  
I should seek some professional help  
I should keep my opinions to myself  
I guess I'm out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my  
  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
I am out of my depth  
Yes, I am slowly going out of my mind
