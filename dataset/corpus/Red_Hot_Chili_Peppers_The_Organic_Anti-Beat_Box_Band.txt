Oh yeah!  
Can you dig it, can you dig it  
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when  
The 'Fax City Four' were four young men  
  
Time has come, now we jam  
With the uplift mofo party plan  
We're the organic anti-beat box band  
One comes from the holy land  
Another was born an Australian  
  
Me I'm from Michigan  
But Hollywood is the land of lands  
It's a Hollywood jam  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Organic anti-beat box band  
  
Life is grand in the land of lands  
The mind does boggle the mind expands  
The anarchy for have manned their craft  
Get on your knees and shake your ass  
  
To the jam that is  
We don't ask we demand  
That you and your clan  
Listen now to this jam  
To the power of the drummers bad  
  
It's a Hollywood jam  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Organic anti-beat box band  
There's a party in my town at 12:00  
There's a party that's rockin' down to the rock  
  
I've got nothin' against hip hop  
But there's a party in my town  
And no beat box jam that is  
The party's got girls the girls got hot  
The party's got boys and the boys got socks  
Something popped the doors unlocked  
House got up ran around the block  
  
Sit down house  
Take off your blouse  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
Any good friend of the lollipop kids  
Over the rainbow with the wiz  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
  
Organic anti-beat box band  
With the organic anti-beat box band  
You just might slam dance that is  
It's a Hollywood jam!
