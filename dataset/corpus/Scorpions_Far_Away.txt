Take your hand and you take my hand  
Let's try to learn to fly  
Here what I say, here what I say  
Dream and close your eyes  
  
Too much hate  
Too much hate  
So many things are wrong  
So many ways, so many ways  
Flying through the sky forever  
into another time  
  
Yesterday so far away  
Many miles together  
Were looking for a way  
  
Day by day  
So far away  
All the world  
To do the same  
  
So we go together  
Will you show me the way  
Time has gone  
It has gone  
  
Far away, far away  
  
And today  
I'll see a way  
Follow me we love you  
Just listen, what I say  
  
Forget your name and yesterday  
Put out your hand  
I'll do the same  
  
Now were going to another land  
Will you show me the way  
Time has gone  
It has gone far away  
Far away
