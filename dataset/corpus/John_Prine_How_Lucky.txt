Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah, shook my head and made myself a bet  
There was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
I bronzed my shoes and hung from a rearview mirror  
Bronzed admiration in the blind spot of regret  
There was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah, scratched my head and lit my cigarette  
Well, there was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Today I walked down the street I use to wander

Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Hey, how lucky can  
One ..  
Man..  
Get.
