He's the king of sting, Mr. Morphine my friend  
Uncle Slam, the medicine man  
And I'm a junkie with a big King Kong sized monkey  
Crawling up and down my back  
  
Oh, I'll help ya son to rearrange your mind  
Oh, I'll help ya son but ya gotta buy this time  
I'm your doctor  
  
Help me please, oh Doctor, help me please  
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you  
Doctor please, my M.D., fix me in my time of need  
But, can ya see the fire that's in my eyes  
  
It's the mirror from the wall, that's on the table  
Feeding me little white lies  
And I'm wasted in a waste land, I'm a junk man  
I got tombstones in my eyes  
  
Ah, help me Uncle Slam, the beast claims another man  
Cocaine, Codine, 714, a tuinol blindfold just what I need  
Help me, help me, help me  
  
Help me please, oh Doctor, help me please  
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you  
Doctor please, my M.D., fix me in my time of need  
But, can ya see the fire that's in my eye
