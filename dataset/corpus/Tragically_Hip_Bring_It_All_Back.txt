I'd been carving you  
To see what form you'd take  
You were hiding in ivory  
I just wanted to free you shape  
  
Bringing me down, its too quiet to breathe  
Who wants to hear their heart beat?  
  
It's gotta be here  
In your spider-web alphabets  
Did I read it all wrong?  
Or have I just not gotten it yet?  
  
You got what you want. You wanted release.  
Can you be appeased? Can you bring it all back to me?  
Bring it all back to me  
  
Bringing me down, the obvious turned out to be true  
All that I couldn't see, how it was turning me on  
I don't want to pare you down  
No, I don't want to wear you down  
I don't want any more than what's here  
No, I don't want to pare you down  
  
Well you got what you want. You wanted release.  
Can you be appeased? Can you bring it all back to me?  
Just bring Just bring it all back to me  
  
It's all that I want  
It's all that I need  
It's all that I want  
  
Bring it all back to me  
Bring it, give it, bring it
