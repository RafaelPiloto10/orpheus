Where were you last night?  
You were so uptight  
What did you do, who did you see?  
Were you with someone  
Who reminded you of me?  
  
Where were you last night?  
  
Where were you last week?  
Were you up a creek?  
Did you stay up pacing the floor?  
Got me worried  
You ignore me more and more  
  
Where were you last night?  
You werent around me  
When they found me  
Where were you last night?  
  
Youd better stop your messin around  
Your name is going round from town to town  
Its making me sad  
Making me feel bad  
Where were you last night?  
  
Where were you last year?  
Youre sure as [...]  
You werent waiting where you said  
You sent someone in your place instead  
  
Where were you last night?  
Its getting to me  
Making me gloomy  
Where were you last night?
