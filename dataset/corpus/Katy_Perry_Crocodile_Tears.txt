[Intro]  
Oh, when we go numb  
Oh, when we come down  
High up on this chasin', hardly moving but it feels right  
  
[Verse 1]  
Drift away  
The haze slows down the pulse  
Latency  
A mind of cruise control  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Well I'll give you all or nothing  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Is what I've got, trust me  
  
[Chorus]  
Static, static, static, moves, oh  
Static, static, stuck on you  
Static, static, moves, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
We escape  
We're lying on the moon  
Stay awake  
To see the naked truth  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Well I'll give you all or nothing  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Is what I've got, trust me  
  
[Chorus]  
Static, static, static, moves, oh  
Static, static, stuck on you  
Static, static, moves, oh, oh  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, when we go numb  
Oh, when we come down  
High up on this chasin', hardly moving but it feels right  
  
[Chorus]  
Static, static, static, moves, oh  
Static, static, stuck on you  
Static, static, moves, oh, oh
