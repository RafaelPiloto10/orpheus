You are a young man and you're eager to seek  
A way to let the world know what you think  
The lesson learned is not taught in a school  
You have to start out first by being a fool  
  
But I seen changes, they happen every day  
And I see change coming your way  
  
You give your life away  
For what in return  
One chance to see your name in lights  
While you learn  
  
Your manager is home  
And working a way  
To keep you on the road  
And moving day to day  
  
But I seen changes, they happen every day  
And I see change coming your way  
  
You work yourself to death  
So you can have a home  
You put your money aside  
To call it all your own  
  
You finally save enough  
And you think you're gonna advance  
Turn around, there's Uncle Sam  
He's got his hand down your pants  
  
And I seen changes, they happen every day  
And I see change coming your way  
  
Maybe some change is all that we need  
Change is coming to help us succeed  
Change happens every day  
Change happens every day  
Change happens every day
