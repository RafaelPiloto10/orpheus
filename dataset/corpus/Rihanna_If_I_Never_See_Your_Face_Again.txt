Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away  
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway.  
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one  
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun.  
  
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away  
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you).  
But you feel my breath, on your neck  
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you).  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight  
  
Sometimes you move so well  
It's hard not to give in.  
  
I'm lost, I can't tell  
Where you end and I begin.  
  
It makes you burn to learn  
I'm with another man.  
  
I wonder if he's half  
The lover that I am.  
  
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away  
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you).  
But you feel my breath, On your neck  
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you).  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight  
  
Baby, baby, please believe me  
Find it in your heart to reach me  
Promise not to leave me behind  
(Promise not to leave me behind)  
  
Take me down, but take it easy  
Make me think but don't deceive me  
Torture me by taking your time  
(Talk to me, talk to me)  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
