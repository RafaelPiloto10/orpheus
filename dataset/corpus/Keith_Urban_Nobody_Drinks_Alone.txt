You brought that bottle home in a paper sack  
Drew the blinds and locked the doors  
And there's nothing but empty there inside that glass  
So you pour a little more  
And there's no one there to judge you  
At least that's what you tell yourself, but  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you know  
Nobody drinks alone  
Every demon, every ghost  
From your past  
And every memory you've held back  
Follows you home  
Nobody drinks alone  
  
You remember whiskey on your daddy's breath  
So you always stick to wine  
And you scared your little brother half to death  
You just kept it all inside  
You can hear your mama cryin'  
Only now she cries for you, and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though you're only  
Hey don't you let that feelin' fool ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody drinks alone
