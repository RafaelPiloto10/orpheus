You tell me that you love me, I know that it is lied  
But I keep right on believin' in a fool's paradise  
I make believe, baby-baby, I make believe, baby-baby  
Make believin's easy in a fool's paradise  
Everybody's askin', what can the trouble be  
Well it seems that they all want it baby  
Not half as much as me  
I make believe, baby-baby, I make believe, baby-baby  
Make believin's easy in a fool's paradise  
(Let's rock it! Oh, I'm so lonely I could cry)  
  
Keep right on a-tryin' to leave this place I'm in  
But then you smiled at someone else  
And I'm knocked back yet again  
I make believe, baby-baby, I make believe, baby-baby  
Make believin's easy in a fool's paradise  
Make believin's easy in a fool's paradise
