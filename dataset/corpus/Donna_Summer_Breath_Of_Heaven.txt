And Gabriel appeared to Mary and said  
"Do not be afraid Mary  
You have found favor with god  
You will be with child  
And give birth to a son  
And you are to give him the name Jesus  
He will be great  
And will be called the son of the most high  
And the lord god will give him the throne of his father David  
And he will reign over the house of David forever  
His kingdom will never end"  
  
I have traveled many moonless night  
Cold and weary with a babe inside  
And I wonder what I've done  
Holy father you have come  
And chosen me now to carry your son  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone  
Must I walk this path alone  
Be with me now  
Be with me now  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For your are holy  
Breath of heaven  
  
Do you wonder as you watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be  
Help me  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven
