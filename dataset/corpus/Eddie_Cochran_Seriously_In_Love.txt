Serious, serious, seriously in love  
Serious, serious, seriously in love  
You-mmm-you-you my-my lovely one  
Mmm-mm, my only one, as bright as a star  
With eyes as true as the ocean blue  
That's why I'm serious, well, over you  
  
Oh please, please hold me tight  
Don't let me go, not tonight  
I see the tears, the cryin'  
And I see the lips that try not to say goodbye  
And that's why I'm so serious  
I'm serious over you  
  
You-ooh-you-you my lovely one  
You're my only one, as bright as a star  
With eyes true as the ocean blue  
That's why I'm serious, wohw, over you
