Today's your day  
We going out my baby  
You and me  
It's a safe location  
Let's get away  
For your birthday  
Take a nice little trip  
Somewhere cross the bay  
  
Hit the mall  
Go get your tips did up  
Your nanny got the kids  
Let's live it up  
About a quarter to eight  
And I won't be late  
The 55 will be parked  
At the gate baby  
  
Make a wish  
Close your eyes  
Blow away hey  
When you're done  
Girl  
Give me a kiss  
Make a wish  
I'll make  
All your dreams  
Come true  
Make a wish  
Girl  
There's nothing  
That I wouldn't do  
Make a wish  
  
Just make a wish  
Write out a list  
What's broke is fixed  
Make a wish  
What's diamonds  
And pearls  
You know

Make a wish

No ifs or maybes  
No possibles

You're driving me crazy  
Make a wish  
Now open your eyes  
I gotta surprise

I copped a CI645  
Are you ready  
To take  
Your first slide  
Cut the ribbon  
Off the whip  
Put the key in  
And let's shift  
  
Let's ride  
From coast to coast  
Hit a nice lounge  
Might as well  
Have a toast baby  
On this special day  
  
We're gonna celebrate  
My baby's birthday  
  
Make a wish  
Close your eyes  
Blow away
