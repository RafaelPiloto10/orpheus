See I know a little bit something good  
Always comes out of a little bit something bad  
And I wasn't looking for someone new  
Till you came down  
Giving me the best the time I've had  
And now you're on my skin, body to body  
Working me out, Yeah you, you play to win  
Rocking me steady, Round after round  
Ooh, ooh  
  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love Oh, oh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Ooh, ooh I  
  
Mistakes I don't worry 'bout them no more  
'Cause you got me, I'm on Cloud 9  
So good, no I cannot just keep it real  
T-shirt and jeans  
See you making me feel so fly  
And now you're on my skin  
Body to body  
Working me out  
Yeah you, you play to win  
Rocking me steady  
Round after round  
Oh, oh  
  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Oh, oh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Ooh, ooh I  
  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name  
'Cause I  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I I I  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name  
'Cause I  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I I I  
  
Ooh, ooh  
  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love Ooh, ooh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love Ooh, ooh I  
  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Ooh, ooh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Ooh, ooh I
