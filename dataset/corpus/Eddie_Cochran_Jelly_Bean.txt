Jelly bean, jelly bean  
Well that's the name we picked for you  
And it fits you to-a-t  
And now I tell you why it's true  
Cause you're sweet 'n' swell 'n' round  
And a-pretty to the pound, jelly bean  
  
There's a guy who lives in our block  
His name is curly carr  
Each night he comes around the street  
Packin' his guitar  
Stops at jelly bean's house  
That pretty little thing  
Bows his head and bends his knees  
You oughta hear him sing  
  
Jelly bean comes to the window  
And she listens for a while  
Never even blinks her eye, always in a smile  
Tosses up her pretty curls and turns to go  
Packs his guitar on more time  
And sings his tale of woe
