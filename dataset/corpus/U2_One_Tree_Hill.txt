We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill  
As the day begs the night for mercy love  
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows  
Only scars carved into stone  
On the face of earth  
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill  
We see the sun go down in your eyes  
  
You run like river, on like a sea  
You run like a river runs to the sea  
  
And in the world a heart of darkness  
A fire zone  
Where poets speak their heart  
Then bleed for it  
Jara sang, his song a weapon  
In the hands of love  
You know his blood still cries  
From the ground  
  
It runs like a river runs to the sea  
It runs like a river to the sea  
  
I don't believe in painted roses  
Or bleeding hearts  
While bullets rape the night of the merciful  
I'll see you again  
When the stars fall from the sky  
And the moon has turned red  
Over One Tree Hill  
  
We run like a river  
Run to the sea  
We run like a river to the sea  
And when it's raining  
Raining hard  
That's when the rain will  
Break my heart  
  
Raining...raining in the heart  
Raining in your heart  
Raining...raining to your heart  
Raining, raining...raining  
Raining to your heart  
Raining...raining in your heart  
Raining in your heart..  
To the sea  
  
Oh great ocean  
Oh great sea  
Run to the ocean  
Run to the sea
