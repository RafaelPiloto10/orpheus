I was cutting the rug  
Down at place called The Jug  
With a girl named Linda Lou  
When in walked a man  
With a gun in his hand  
And he was looking for you know who  
He said, "Hey there, fellow  
With the hair colored yellow  
Whatcha tryin' to prove?  
'Cause that's my woman there  
And I'm a man who cares  
And this might be all for you"  
I said, "Excuse me"  
  
I was scared and fearing for my life  
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree  
'Cause he was lean, mean  
Big and bad, Lord  
Pointin' that gun on me  
"Oh, wait a minute, mister  
I didn't even kiss her  
Don't want no trouble with you  
And I know you don't owe me  
But I wish you'd let me  
Ask one favor from you"  
  
"Oh, won't you  
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister  
Gimme three steps toward the door?  
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister  
And you'll never see me no more"  
  
For, sure  
  
Well the crowd cleared away  
And I began to pray  
And the water fell on the floor  
And I'm telling you, son  
Well, it ain't no fun  
Staring straight down a forty-four  
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou  
And that's the break I was looking for  
Well, you could hear me screaming a mile away  
I was headed out toward the door  
  
"Oh, won't you  
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister  
Gimme three steps toward the door?  
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister  
And you'll never see me no more"  
  
Show me the back door
