Sensations drift away  
When I'm all alone  
How can you take away my feelings  
Bet our love until you lose  
Then give back what you've been stealing  
All these changes I go through  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
Temptation rips away  
Can this girl stay true  
I just keep hanging on  
Cause I know it's hard to find the magic  
That's in every part of you  
All the boys, they got to have it  
All these changes I go through  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering...  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still in love with you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
You know, I'm still in love with you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
I'm still in love with you
