Is it really true what they're saying  
Are you really sure there's nobody come for me  
When I'm walking home there is no-one  
Once there was a house, full of laughter - so warm  
Trying to pretend there is someone  
Someone who will care when I need it  
  
I will now receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow  
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again  
Now I'm down  
  
When I walk outside, there is nowhere  
Children follow me, with their laughter - so cold...  
Casting just a glance at the churchyard  
Casting just a glance, at my painted female friend.  
  
Now I'm on my way, I am falling  
Got to find some 'elp, ooh I will need that now  
  
So I will receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow  
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again  
Now I'm down...  
  
I will now receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow, now...
