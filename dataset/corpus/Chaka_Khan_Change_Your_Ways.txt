Hey, can you change your ways  
Our love is such a treasure  
Why do you run away  
From things that give you pleasure  
  
I love you all this time  
On and on I've tried to work it out for the right day  
In life you'll learn, you'll see  
From birth, we start to die  
Oh so fast, so near  
There's nothing to lose  
Nothing to fear  
  
So little time to try  
There's so much to know  
Then to see the pain it shows  
To get what you deserve  
To reap what you sow  
That's the way it goes  
  
Why can't you change your ways  
Why can't you change your ways  
Why can't you change your ways
