She pulls the shade  
It's just another sunny Sunday  
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois  
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday,  
She waits for the night to fall  
Then she points a pistol through the door  
And she aims at the streetlight  
While the freeway hisses  
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor  
The streetlight's still burning,  
She always misses  
But the day she hits  
That's the day she'll leave  
That one little victory, that's all she needs!  
She pulls the shade,  
It's just another sunny Monday  
She waits for the night to fall
