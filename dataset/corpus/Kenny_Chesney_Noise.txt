[Verse 1]  
Wrecking balls, downtown construction  
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing  
Cardboard sign says the lord is coming  
Tick, tick, tock  
Rumors turn the mills back home  
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown  
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off  
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here  
Seems like all we ever hear is  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Verse 2]  
24 hour television, get so loud that no one listens  
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk  
But there really ain't no conversation  
Ain't nothing left to the imagination  
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop  
  
[Chorus]  
This noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Bridge]  
Every room, every house, every shade of noise  
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise  
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise  
We can't take the noise, so we just make...  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Outro]  
All this noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't stand the noise  
Can't take the noise
