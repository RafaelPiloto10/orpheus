"There's a place I want to go  
Where the milk and honey flow  
Without God it wasn't there  
Now I feel it everywhere"  
  
When I was lost and couldn't see my way  
I used to follow what everybody say  
Now I know that it's written in the heart  
Now I'm ready, ready to start  
  
Without God it wasn't there  
Now I feel it everywhere  
  
We were always meant to be  
In paradise eternally  
Before the truth I did not care  
Now I feel it everywhere  
  
Feel it, feel it everywhere  
Feel it, feel it  
Can you feel it?  
This might good feeling everywhere  
We've got so much work to do.  
Everywhere
