It's on like Donkey Kong  
You wanted that fast buck  
Now I gotta light that ass up  
The nigga with the big fat trigger  
Don't test me, gravedigger had the swig  
Of the ST, remember the time we first met her  
You threw your set up now you gotta get wetter  
Boom! Ping! Buck! Pow!  
Now who's that nigga with the different style?  
Uh, ya wanted ta trick  
It's all about the pud and who can empty it  
First mate, they made day AK  
And I'll Kurtis Blow ya ass away like AJ  
I'm almost certain I'm put on the hurtin'  
Bitch, it's curtains!  
Locced in my motherfuckin' head  
Gotta play connect-the-dots with my infrared  
You in danger, Mr Gangbanger  
It ain't cool to take nappy from a stranger  
Wit'cha drive-by's it took time to catch ya  
But now I gotta wet'cha  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)  
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)  
I'm comin' ta get'cha (get'cha)  
You better hope I don't catch ya (catch ya)  
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger  
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger  
  
S-I-M-I  
Valley for the KKK, Rodney!  
A place on the map where the order is  
Though devils can't leap up a motorist  
And get nothin' but a slap on the wrist  
Gorillas, gorillas report to the mist  
The fist of fury and I'ma shove em  
Motherfuck the jury and who ever love em  
Why you have to leave it to Beaver?  
Now I'm chasin' Beaver' ass with a cleaver  
With the sling, sling, sling and chop, chop, chop  
Get them on, nigga  
Cos tonight we're havin' chopped liver  
And I'ma cut out'cha heart  
Start the fryin' pan for the devil a'la carte  
Twelve motherfuckers ya better be glad I never met'cha  
Cos I'm gonna wet'cha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now wet motherfuckers are bloody  
Cos a bullet'll mould your ass like silly putty  
White in the shape  
A hollow point'll run up in ya like ya got weight  
Comin' out'cha back, Mr Mack  
Now they got yo' guts in a sack  
Use to have ya crew real fat in a huddle  
Now you're wet in a puddle, here is the Ice Cube rebuttle  
You ain't gotta chance, cos even if my bullet just glance  
Ya still wet your pants  
So what'cha wanna do when I got'cha ass point blank  
Ya guaranteed to spank  
Stiff as a board, ya floored  
Go meet the Lord and then get ignored  
Cos you're on your way to hell and that I can bet'cha  
That's why I had to wet'cha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
