Lately all my thoughts have gone to you  
You know that's true  
Sometimes I feel just a word away  
You'll say oh how I miss you too I do  
  
Time is tight I'm lost for words  
That's not like me  
Only your eyes could know the way that I feel  
And how much I need you now with me  
  
Young love so strong has never been a part of me  
Young love hold on we're feeling it now  
Is this the way it's meant to be  
  
I know I'll be the one to lose if I'm so wrong  
Don't be afraid to put your heart on the line  
I'll take you where I know you belong  
  
Take my thoughts away beyond the things we see  
Sometimes it seems just a word away  
You'll say oh how I really feel it should be  
  
Young love so strong has never been a part of me  
Young love hold on we're feeling it now  
Is this the way it's meant to be
