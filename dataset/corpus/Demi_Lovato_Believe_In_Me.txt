I'm losing myself, trying to compete  
With everyone else  
Instead of just being me  
Don't know where to turn  
I've been stuck in this routine  
I need to change my ways instead of always being weak  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be afraid I want to wake up feeling beautiful today  
And know that I'm okay cause everyone's perfect in an usual way  
So see I just want to believe in me  
  
The mirror can lie doesn't show you what's inside  
And it can tell you your full of life its amazing what you can hide  
Just by putting on a smile  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm quickly finding out  
I'm not about to break down  
Not today  
  
I guess I always knew that I had all the strength to make it through  
I cannot be afraid I want to wake feeling beautiful today  
And know that I'm okay cause everyone's perfect in an usual way  
You see, now, now I believe in me  
  
Now I believe in me
