Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Truth is you've been waiting so long  
You're ripe and so insane  
Can the tentacles of your mind stop the pain  
  
How long will you sit there wondering  
What's happening to your heart  
Can't you fell the love surround you - That's a start  
  
Chorus:  
I'll take to the road in a little while  
Under cover of night  
You come or you stay  
Whatever seems right  
  
I ain't looking for friends or lovers  
Ain't looking for a pot of gold  
Had it all when I was younger - It got old  
  
Who will leave this world of sorrow  
Who will die to all the fears  
Kowning I'll be gone tommorow - Gone for years  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere the sun's just rising  
And the road comes in to view  
There's a wanderer freed from dying - Could be you  
  
Who will pay the price for freedom  
Learn the disciplines of the road  
Many tried but few succeed - So I'm told
