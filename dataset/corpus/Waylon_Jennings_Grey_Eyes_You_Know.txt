That cold north wind is blowing grey eyes you know  
The years are quickly going grey eyes you know  
And the good life I promised you so long ago  
Is dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you know  
We never had much money grey eyes you know  
More rainy days than sunny grey eyes you know  
And life has been a long hard road to hoe  
But you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you know  
Hard times took the blue from your eyes  
Leaving them grey as the winter's skies  
We've had our talk now I must walk away  
Leave you here beneath this mound of clay  
And I feel so empty as I turn to go  
For my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know  
My heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
