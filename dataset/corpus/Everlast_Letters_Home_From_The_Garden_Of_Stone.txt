Sittin' restless under the moonlight  
I know I'm getting ready to kill  
They say we're going in with the day light  
I don't want to but I will  
  
Cause I won't know the man that kills me  
And I don't know these men I kill  
I thank God for my salvation  
Wash away the blood I spill  
  
I try not to think about my family  
Cause it's a little too much to take  
Out here I got me and I got my buddy  
We can't afford even one mistake  
  
I started writing on dirty card boards,  
It's the only paper I could find  
Tell everyone I got their letters,  
Tell everyone I'm doing fine  
  
Late at night when I can dream I,  
I think about life back in the world  
  
I miss you and dad, I miss sister Sarah  
I miss my wife and my baby girl  
  
Pray for me, pray for my soul Ma  
Pray for me and all my sins  
  
They say I got a job to do now  
I'll be back when it finally ends  
  
Do you think I should be fighting?  
Ma, are you proud are you ashamed?  
  
Really I'm trying to do the right thing  
I hope my Government can say the same thing  
  
Cause I won't know the man that kills me  
And I don't know these men I kill  
We all wind upon the same side  
Cause ain't none of us doin' God's Will
