I'm feeling so confused today  
It seems they've changed the rules again  
'cause in my life I'm trying hard  
To do it all so I can remain  
Healthy and sane  
  
I'll live forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
  
I heard it on the radio  
Too much of what they said wasn't so  
And now we've got to do those things  
That they brought before were so wrong  
To be healthy and strong  
  
And live forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
  
I know we don't need you  
I know we don't believe you  
You don't really have the answer  
You think you know better  
You think it really matters  
You just want to rule over everybody's lives  
  
I think I'll change my life today  
Gone are the times of taking care  
And I don't need a reason why  
All I need is all in a day survive in a way  
  
Or just till tomorrow  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Do you really want to live forever
