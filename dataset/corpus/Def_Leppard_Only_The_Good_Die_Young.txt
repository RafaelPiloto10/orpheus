I saw you on a screen  
An icon, a legend, a king  
I heard it in a song  
That's still goin' strong  
  
A shooting star across the sky  
You kiss the earth and say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
Crashing into the sun  
Only the good die young  
  
But they'll always be here  
  
I saw you in a dream  
Fallin' apart at the seams  
I heard it in your voice  
That you had no choice  
  
'Cos genius is a heavy load  
That leads you down the lonely road  
But love never dies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Living inside our hearts and minds  
Shining like a diamond in the sky  
You take me so far away  
  
A shooting star across the sky  
You kiss the earth and say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young
