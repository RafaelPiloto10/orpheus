Driving through the night,  
Tears are running down my face,  
I start to realize, all the things that I once said,  
I promised you the world  
It's nothing more than you deserve  
It's killing me inside, to know I put you through this hell,  
  
Take away my heart,  
It doesn't want to work no more  
I never meant to make you cry,  
  
[Chorus]  
California calling 20 miles to go,  
And I don't, I don't know,  
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?  
No I don't, I don' t know  
I don't know,  
No I don't know  
  
I'm on the road and it feels so cold outside,  
It's driving me insane, to know how much you hurt tonight,  
Take away my heart, it doesn't want to work no more,  
I never meant to make you cry  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
California calling 20 miles to go,  
And I don't, I don't know,  
Shod I turn around or shod I leave you alone?  
No I don't, I don' t know  
I don't know,  
No I don't know  
  
Gotta keep on moving on [Repeat: x3]  
California calling, California calling,  
Gotta keep on moving on [Repeat: x3]  
California calling, California calling,
