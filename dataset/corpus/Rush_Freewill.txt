There are those who think that life  
Has nothing left to chance  
With a host of holy horrors  
To direct our aimless dance  
  
A planet of playthings  
We dance on the strings  
Of powers we cannot perceive  
"The stars aren't aligned,  
Or the gods are malign"  
Blame is better to give than receive  
  
You can choose a ready guide  
In some celestial voice  
If you choose not to decide  
You still have made a choice  
  
You can choose from phantom fears  
And kindness that can kill  
I will choose a path that's clear  
I will choose free will  
  
There are those who think that  
They've been dealt a losing hand  
The cards were stacked against them,  
They weren't born in Lotus-Land  
  
All preordained  
A prisoner in chains  
A victim of venomous fate  
Kicked in the face  
You can't pray for a place  
In heaven's unearthly estate  
  
Each of us  
A cell of awareness  
Imperfect and incomplete  
Genetic blends  
With uncertain ends  
On a fortune hunt  
That's far too fleet
