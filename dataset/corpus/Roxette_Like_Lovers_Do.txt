Take the line between us  
And hold it close to you,  
I want us to get together,  
Like lovers do.  
  
Let me kiss away your troubles,  
The cold and lonely nights,  
Just take this heart I'm giving  
And love is on the rise.  
  
Like lovers do  
Want to hold you through the night,  
Like lovers do  
And when I look into your eyes,  
  
Like lovers do  
Oh I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion.  
It feels just like forever  
Since I made love to you,  
  
September days of scarlet,  
April morning dew.  
So take the love between us  
And hold it close to you,  
  
I want us to get together  
Like lovers do
