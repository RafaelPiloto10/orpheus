Every official that comes in  
Cripples us leaves us maimed  
Silent and tamed  
And with our flesh and bones  
He builds his homes  
Southern fist  
Rise through tha jungle mist  
Clenched to smash power so cancerous  
A black flag and a red star  
A rising sun loomin' over los angeles  
Cause for raza livin in la la  
Is like gaza on to tha dawn of intifada  
Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on  
And seize tha metropolis  
It's you that it's built on  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
And everything changed on a new years day, come on  
  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land!  
  
Their existence is a crime  
Their seat their robe their tie  
Their land deeds  
Their hired guns  
They're tha crime  
Shots heard underground round tha rapture  
Tha world's eye captured  
At last in a Mexican pasture  
Tha masked screaming land or death  
Within a breath  
A war from tha depth of time  
Who shot four puppet governors in a line  
Who shook all tha world bankers  
Who think they can rhyme  
Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine  
Yes, it's a war from tha depth of time  
  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
Everything can change on a new years day  
And everything can change on a new years day, come on  
  
Oh, hear the masked scream  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
  
It's land or death  
  
Yeah!  
Oh, come, come, yes, yes, yes  
  
It's war within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death  
War within a breath  
It's land or death
