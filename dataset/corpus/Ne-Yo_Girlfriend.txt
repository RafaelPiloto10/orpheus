She's a goddess ghetto queen  
Sitting at the park eating sunflower seeds  
And I don't know if I'm being cocky  
But I swear I think that she was staring at me  
  
I stepped to her like  
Hey sugar mama you outta line  
Being how ya lookin' so fine  
Just wanna know how I could buy  
  
Some of your time  
She said sorry your not my type  
  
[Chorus]  
She blew my mind when she replied  
I gotta girlfriend  
Girl that's alright I'm not hatin'  
Just tryin' to cool wit u cool wit u  
  
Sure that's your lifestyle ain't nuthin' wrong  
To be honest girl it kinda turns me on  
I ain't even tryna to gash up a happy crib  
But you can call me when you need that alternative  
  
Or someone to hold a camera with a steady hand  
Don't you even trip  
Girl I'm your man  
Or if you decide to give the male race a second chance  
She said sorry but I'm taken  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She blew my mind when she replied  
I gotta girlfriend  
Girl it's alright I'm not hatin'  
Just trying to cool wit u cool wit u  
  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
What's crackin' with menage-a-trois?  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
  
Is it even cool if I can just watch?  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
Baby I just wanna cool wit you
