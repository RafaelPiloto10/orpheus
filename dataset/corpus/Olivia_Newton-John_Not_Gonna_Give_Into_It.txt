(Olivia Newton-John)  
No me voy a rendir, no no  
No me voy a rendir, no no  
No me voy a rendir, no no  
No me voy a rendir  
Oh I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it no no  
I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it  
There are nights when the moon  
Shines in my eyes and haunts my mind  
And I can't sleep a wink  
And I really don't want to think  
There are times when I feel  
If I sleep I'll die  
But I dare not cry  
And I run from my tears  
And I fight them back with my fears  
Oh I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it no no  
I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it  
And I feel so alone  
For although you care  
No one else can share  
It's my own misery  
In the end it's all up to me  
Oh I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it no no  
I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it  
And I watch you sleep soundly  
So peacefully unaware  
And your breath is soothing to me  
And it's good to know you're there  
Then the morning comes  
With it's golden light  
And I feel alright  
And my heart beats again  
But the night is not my friend  
Oh I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it no no  
I'm not gonna give into it no  
I'm not gonna give into it
