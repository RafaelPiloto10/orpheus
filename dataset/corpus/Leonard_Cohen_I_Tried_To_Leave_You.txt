I tried to leave you, I don't deny  
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times.  
I'd wake up every morning by your side.  
  
The years go by, you lose your pride.  
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside,  
And all your work it's right before your eyes.  
  
Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied,  
The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide.  
And here's a man still working for your smile.
