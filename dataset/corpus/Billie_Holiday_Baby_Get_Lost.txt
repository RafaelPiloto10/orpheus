Well good morning baby, welcome back to town  
How do, fine papa, welcome back to town  
You're doing so much travelling never know  
When you'll be around  
You're a fine and mellow fella  
But you're stubborn as a mule  
You love me like an angel  
But you treat me like a fool  
Two-faced daddy don't hand me no doublecross  
You'll see any time I'm ready  
I can tell you baby get lost  
You're cheating on the outside  
Doing anything you choose  
You better come back on the inside  
'cause you got too much to lose  
Don't want no trouble I've got to be the boss  
And if you can't play it my way  
Well now baby get lost  
I try to stop your cheating  
But I just don't have the time  
'cause I got so many men that  
They're standing right in line  
Keep cool papa, you got to come across  
'cause any time I'm ready, yes any time I'm ready  
You know when I'm ready  
I can tell you baby get lost  
Why don't you get lost
