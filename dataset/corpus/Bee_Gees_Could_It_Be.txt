Look at me, I don't know what I'm doin'  
ever since I looked at you  
How did I get this crazy feelin'  
Could it be, I'm in love with you  
  
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight  
I've had this feeling through and through  
Since that time, I haven't done a thing right  
Could it be, I'm in love with you  
  
Golly gee, I don't know where I'm goin'  
I'm tryin' to make you see  
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me, oh  
  
Night after night, I'm always dreamin'  
Why don't you make those dreams come true  
Can't you see how much I really love you  
Why don't you learn to love me too  
  
Golly gee, I don't know where I'm goin'  
I'm tryin' to make you see  
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me  
  
Night after night, I'm always dreamin'  
Why don't you make those dreams come true  
Can't you see how much I really love you  
Why don't you learn to love me too  
Love me too  
Love me too
