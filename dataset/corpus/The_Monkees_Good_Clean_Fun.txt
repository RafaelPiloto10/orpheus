There's a smile on the wind as it touches my face  
And starts to erase all the gloom  
And the sun with a kiss, begins to dismiss the  
Memory of my life without you  
Well it seems like yesterday that my path took me away  
Although I know it's been at least a year  
But now my path heads home  
And your patient time alone  
Has brought me even closer to you, dear  
  
And this plane gets closer  
Every minute I look down to a watch that keeps looking back at me  
And it says to me, "Be patient son you've waited this long."  
How can I be strong?  
  
And this the plane gets closer  
Every minute I look down to watch that keeps looking back at me  
And it says to me, "Be patient son you've waited this long."  
How can I be strong?  
  
Well the plane is finally down  
And the engines stopped their sound  
And I look in the crowd and there you stand  
And the gap that once was time  
Is forever closed behind  
I told you I'd come back and here I am.
