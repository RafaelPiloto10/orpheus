You came into my life  
Without a single thing  
I gave into your ways  
Which left me with nothing  
I've given empty smiles  
I've dealt with all your games  
I wish you'd bet right now  
I had to let you win  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
In the sea of life you're just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
I scream without a sound  
How could you take away  
Everything that I was  
Made me a fuckin' slave  
Your face that I despise  
Your heart inside that's gray  
I came today to say  
You're fucked in every way  
  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
  
In the sea of life you're just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
You stole my life  
Without a sigh  
You sucked me dry  
  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
  
In the sea of life you're just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
You stole my life  
Without a sigh  
You sucked me dry
