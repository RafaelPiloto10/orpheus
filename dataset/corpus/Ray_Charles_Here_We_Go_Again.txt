Here we go again  
He's back in town again  
I'll take him back again  
One more time  
  
Here we go again  
The phone will ring again  
I'll be her fool again, I will  
One more time  
  
I've been there before  
But I'll try it again  
Any fool, any fool knows  
That there's no, no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
She'll break my heart again  
I'll play the part again  
One more time  
  
I've been there before  
But I'll try it again  
Any fool, any fool knows  
That there's no, no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
She'll break my heart again  
I'll play the part again  
One more time  
  
I'll take her back again  
One more time.
