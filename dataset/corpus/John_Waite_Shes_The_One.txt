She's got everything I want  
Got my world in a tight black dress  
Keeps me on my feet and walking  
Keeps my heart alive  
  
I look up at the moon  
To see her looking down on me  
And it's a magic carpet ride  
To a place that fate decides  
  
And everytime we go around the world  
We feel like we're millionaires  
We get what we want  
We know who we are  
  
And these days we just don't care  
She's the one  
She's the one in my heart  
She's the one  
  
And we are never apart  
Oh  
It's got me on my knees  
The sun is burning through our sky  
  
Like quicksilver in my mind  
Every time she fills my eyes  
My world's a pinball in a groove  
And we're shooting for the highest score  
  
My reason is desire  
That this key could fit the door  
We go around the world  
We feel like we're millionaires  
  
We get what we want  
We know who we are  
And these days we just don't care  
She's the one  
  
She's the one in my heart  
She's the one  
And we are never apart  
She's the one  
  
Queen of hearts  
For a jack of spades  
I'm the one  
She could never betray  
  
No  
She's all I want to see  
Got my world inside her dress  
Cut me to ribbons  
  
Leaves me down  
Love's life voids the rest  
I'm still looking at the moon  
And she's gazing down on me  
  
Take me anywhere you want  
It's all the same to me  
Everytime we go around the world  
We feel like we're millionaires  
  
We know who we are  
We get what we want  
And these days we just don't care  
She's the one  
  
She's the one in my heart  
She's the one  
And we are never apart  
She's the one  
  
Queen of hearts  
For a jack of spades  
And I'm the one  
That she could never betray  
  
She's the one  
She's the one  
She's the one  
She's the one
