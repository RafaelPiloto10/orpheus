We've got stars directing our fate  
And we're praying it's not too late  
Millennium  
  
Some say that we are players  
Some say that we are pawns  
But we've been making money since the day that we were born  
Then slow down before we fall down  
  
We've got stars directing our fate  
And we're praying it's not too late  
Cause we know we're falling from grace  
Millennium  
  
Live for liposuction  
And detox for your rent  
Overdose at Christmas  
And give it up for lent  
My friends are all so cynical  
Refuse to keep the faith  
We all enjoy the madness cause we know we're gonna to fade away  
  
We've got stars directing our fate  
And we're praying it's not too late  
Cause we know we're falling from grace  
Millennium  
  
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough (X2)  
  
Millennium (X2)  
  
We've got stars directing our fate  
And we're praying it's not too late  
Cause we know we're falling from grace  
Millennium  
  
And when we come we always come to late  
I often think that we were born to hate  
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes (X2)  
  
We've got stars directing our fate  
(millennium)and we're praying it's not too late  
(millennium)cuase we know we're falling from grace  
Millennium
