When he offers his hand  
Don't you turn him away  
He can lead you to light  
Through the darkest of days  
With his love wrapped around you  
You can't go astray  
When he offers his hand  
Don't you turn him away  
  
In a world full of sorrow  
A world full of hate  
You can't wait for tomorrow  
'cause tomorrow's to late  
Come and stand amongst the pilgrims  
In their golden array  
When he offers his hand  
Don't you turn him away  
  
I am no simon,  
No matthew, no paul  
It don't take an apostle  
To answer his call  
And it don't take a prophet  
To stand up and say  
When he offers his hand  
Don't you turn him away  
  
I hope as I'm leavin'  
My message is clear  
It's a fool that would turn down  
A gift that's so dear  
When he offers his blood  
Your depts to repay  
Now he offers his hand  
Don't you turn him away
