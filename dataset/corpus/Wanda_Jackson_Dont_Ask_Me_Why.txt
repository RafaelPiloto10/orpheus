I'll go on loving you don't ask me why  
Don't know what else to do don't ask me why  
How sad my heart would be if you should go  
Though you're not good for me I want you so  
  
It's not the kind of love I've dreamed about  
But it's the kind that I can't live without  
You're all I'm longing for don't say goodbye  
I need you more and more don't ask me why  
  
[Piano ]  
  
It's not the kind of love...
