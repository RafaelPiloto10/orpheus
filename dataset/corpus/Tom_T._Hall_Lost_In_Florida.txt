(Lost in Florida lost in Florida)  
Here's the ocean and here's the sand but I don't know where I am  
Here's a seashell and here's a fish here's a turtle and here's a wish  
If you find me take me home if they don't want me leave me alone  
If you find out they forgot me take me back to ole Sopchoppy  
(Lost in Florida lost in Florida)  
Here's an oyster and here's a clam but I don't know where I am  
Here's a gator and here's a bear but I don't worry and I don't care  
If you find me take me home...  
(Lost in Florida lost in Florida)  
Here's the skyline and here's the land but I don't know where I am  
Call me Bobby or call me Paul but don't call me north at all  
(Lost in Florida lost in Florida lost in Florida lost in Florida)
