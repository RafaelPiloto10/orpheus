Darling, let's have another baby  
Let's make one soon on our second honeymoon  
Darling, I need you to be near me  
To kiss and to touch, I love you very much  
Darling, if you ever leave me  
I'll cry a million tears  
I'll go to the nearest boozer  
And drink ten pints of beer

I'll be quite happy to wash and change its nappy
