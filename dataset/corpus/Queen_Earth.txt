I might be at a table  
And suddenly I'll catch  
A fleeting vision of her crystal seas  
Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway  
Underneath the sun I've never seen  
'Cause I have seen many worlds  
For what it's worth  
But I'll never see again the planet earth  
My earth  
I might be chasing waves of light  
Out towards the rim  
Where stars are sparse  
And the cold of space seeps in  
But I might be in a bar room  
Drinking methylated gin  
And thinking of the places I have been  
Yes I have seen many worlds  
For what it's worth  
But I'll never see again the planet earth  
My earth  
I have seen many worlds  
For what it's worth  
But I'll never see again the planet earth  
My earth  
Cast adrift amongst the stars  
I float from sun to sun  
Dreaming of the world that gave me birth  
All the places I have been  
Remind me there is none  
To match the green living hills of earth  
'Cause I have seen many worlds  
For what it's worth  
But I'll never see again the planet earth  
My earth
