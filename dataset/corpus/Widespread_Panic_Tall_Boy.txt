Was broken down, by the side of the road, yeah  
Was crawling in the darkness like a king snake in the woods  
We were hiding in the tall grass  
Hiding in the tall grass  
Just looking for a place to shed our skins  
  
We're gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world won't be the same  
Won't be the same, Lord  
  
Snapshot lightning, silhouette expressions,  
Monumental faces in the flesh of Cypress trees and killing vines  
Naked in the mud, girl  
Let's sling a little mud, girl  
Just looking for a place to shed our skins  
  
We're gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world won't be the same  
We're gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world won't be the same  
Won't be the same, Lord  
  
Feeling weak in the Itta Bina hot sun  
Crawling to the station we were foamin' at the mouth  
Sippin' on a tall boy, sippin' on a tall boy  
Just looking for a place to shed our skins  
  
We're gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world won't be the same  
We're gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world won't be the same  
We're gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world won't be the same  
Show me the way, Lord!
