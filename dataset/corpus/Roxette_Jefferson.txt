Jefferson was always out of luck  
I remember when we both grew up  
Jefferson got hit by a westbound truck  
I guess that didn't make him look like a million bucks  
That night when Sally really stole the show  
And every boy was captured diggin' for gold  
Poor old Jefferson was left in the snow  
  
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson Pray for Jefferson's soul  
  
Jefferson is always on my mind  
When him and me were runnin' out of time  
Jefferson was sure enough left behind  
The cops came in and took him by surprise  
That night when Sally really showed her game  
The neighbourhood would never be the same  
Poor old Jefferson got the blame  
  
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson Pray for Jefferson's soul  
  
I do believe he didn't do wrong  
I say a prayer for someone I care for  
  
That night where Sally really gave it all  
And made us small boys look quite tall  
Poor old Jefferson left the ball
