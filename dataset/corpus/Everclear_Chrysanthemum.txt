Yes I hate the way I feel and it makes no sense  
Five months gone and all I got  
Pretty pink flowers on my chain link fence  
I don't like what it means  
Cause I know there's more to come  
I can't go home without  
Chrysanthemum  
  
I walk around lost and I don't know why  
I don't see the faces or the places I should recognize  
It's like that dream where it feels like home but it don't look right  
Yes I will look everywhere tonight  
I will not stop till I make things right  
And I can't go home till I see the sun  
I can't go home without  
Chrysanthemum  
No I can't go home without  
Chrysanthemum
