Verse:  
When I saw you today my hearts beats fast and I can't explain anything about
it doing something to see you day by day. Everything changes when I come in
your places.  
  
Chorus:  
Cause it down to the mountain and I can see you there hoping for sweet smile
and don't know what to do. I can't tell you about it because you have love
someone that you love more than me. But, someday you will love me.  
  
Bridge:  
It's going dark and I can't go home because when I see you, you make fall me
fall in live with you.  
  
Chorus:  
Cause it down to the mountain you make me smile I go and find another like you
cause down to the mountain you make me fall for you everyday.  
Cause down to the mountain you make me smile.....
