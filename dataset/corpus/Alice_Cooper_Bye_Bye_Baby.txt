What's wrong with you today  
I could never tell?  
Got something drastic on your mind  
I can smell the smell  
  
Honey, what's your trip today?  
Can't look me in the eye  
A couple thousand miles away  
You took me by surprise  
  
You left a message on the telephone  
From New York City, your new home  
You didn't like the neighborhood  
You really hated Hollywood  
  
[Chorus]  
You said  
Bye bye, baby  
Bye bye, girl  
Bye bye, baby  
You're in another world  
  
You said my friends are boring  
You said my house is small  
You like it fifty stories high  
You like livin' tall  
  
You hate the L.A. freeways  
You hate the L.A. smog  
You hate the west coast phonies  
You like the city dogs  
  
I'm confused but I'm not mad  
Said I'm the worst you've ever had  
I ain't delusional or institutional  
But I'm pretty sure I ain't that bad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tried to reach you on your private line  
You sure ain't calling mine  
Now I'm sittin' here all alone  
With a broken heart in three time zones  
  
Bye bye, baby  
(Bye bye, baby)  
Bye bye, girl  
(Paging your phone)  
  
Bye bye, baby  
(Please check your email)  
Bye bye, girl  
(Why not your beeper?)  
  
Bye bye, baby  
(Stick your head out the window)  
Bye bye, girl  
(Oh, I'm mad as hell)  
Bye bye, baby  
  
Anyone at home?  
Hello? Hello?  
Anybody there?  
Hello? Pick up?
