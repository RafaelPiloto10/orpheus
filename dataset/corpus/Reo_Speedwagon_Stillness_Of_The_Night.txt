Midnight on the hill I heard the thunder fill  
The stillness of the night  
It hit me like a slap, you're never comin' back  
From the stillness of the night  
It was never black or white, neither wrong or right  
Like the shadow of a full moon's light  
I knew we'd lost the track, when I heard the lightning crack  
The stillness of the night  
  
[Chorus]  
In the stillness of the night  
That's when we'll make it right  
We can stop the thunder till the light  
In the stillness of the night  
  
I know you think you hear, those voices in your ear  
In the stillness of the night  
But I've tried to make it clear there's nothing left to fear  
Just the stillness of the night  
And if you listen hard you might find the reason for your fright  
Just the wind is high tonight  
And the danger we must face is the anger of this race  
In the stillness of the night  
  
[Chorus]
