I've had enough  
Of this parade  
I'm thinking of  
The words to say  
We open up  
Unfinished parts  
Broken up  
It's so mellow  
  
And when I see you then I know it will be next to me  
And when I need you then I know you will be there with me  
I'll never leave you  
  
Just need to get closer, closer  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
Closer, closer  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
  
Keep waking up (waking up)  
Without you here (without you here)  
Another day (another day)  
Another year (another year)  
I seek the truth (seek the truth)  
We set apart (we set apart)  
Thinking of  
A second chance (a second chance)  
  
And when I see you then I know it will be next to me  
And when I need you I know you will be there with me  
I'll never leave you  
  
Just need to get closer, closer  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
Closer, closer  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
  
And when I see you then I know it will be next to me  
And when I need you I know you will be there with me  
I'll never leave you  
  
Just need to get closer, closer  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
Closer, closer  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
Lean on me now  
  
Closer, closer  
Closer, closer
