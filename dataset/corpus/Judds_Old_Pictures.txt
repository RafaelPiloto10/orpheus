Here's a little girl playin' dress up  
Somewhere under all that lace  
Standin' in her mama's high heeled shoes  
With a lipstick covered face  
And here's a little boy on a pony  
He's a cowboy all the way  
He used to pull my hair and make me mad  
At the Saturday matinee  
Who would've thought that I'd lose my heart  
To the same little boy someday  
  
Lookin' through my old pictures  
Faded photographs  
Some of them bring me close to tears  
Others make me laugh  
Old memories seem to come alive  
And open up the past again  
And let me dream inside  
  
Here's brother with his first automobile  
Thought he'd washed the paint away  
He took a job that took him West  
He's doing very well  
We don't see much of brother these days  
And this is my favorite of my papa  
He's dressed up in his Sunday suit  
A wide brimmed hat, a watch on a chain  
Well, I'm gonna tell you the truth  
It's a picture of a downright handsome man  
Caught in the prime of his youth  
  
Lookin' through my old pictures  
Faded photographs  
Some of them bring me close to tears  
Others make me laugh  
Old memories seem to come alive  
And open up the past again  
And let me dream inside  
  
They open up the past again and let me dream inside
