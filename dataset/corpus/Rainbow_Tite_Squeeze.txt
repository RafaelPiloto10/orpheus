I ain't lyin' to you baby...I hope you don't refuse  
But I'm red hot...Ready or not...to give my love to you  
I don't have forever, but I got tonight  
The look in your eye said you'll give it a try...  
I know the moment's right...  
Ooh - give it to me...you got everything I need  
Ooh - do it to me...Bring me to my knees  
When you gimme that tite squeeze...  
Baby, baby please  
Gimme that tite squeeze  
When you start to touch me...I can't believe it's real  
You make it hard for me to take. I love the way you feel  
I'm hungry for you baby, I just can't get enough..  
If it's alright I'll take a bite, I'll taste your love  
Ooh - give it to me...you got everything I need  
Ooh - do it to me...Bring me to my knees  
When you gimme that tite squeeze -  
Gimme that tite squeeze - yeah  
Rock me in your cradle, roll me like the dice  
Do it to me and I'll do it to you, do it till we do it right  
Don't tell me that you love me, when you walk out the door  
Cause I'll hold you down, turn you around, I'll come back for more  
Ooh - give it to me...you got everything I need  
Ooh - do it to me...Bring me to my knees  
When you gimme that tite, tite, tite yeah...  
Gimme that tite squeeze, ooh baby, gimme that tite squeeze  
Oh - bring me to my knees, gimme that tite squeeze
