No smoke without fire  
When will you ever learn  
That's what you said to me  
Bigger the head that turns,  
I say, maybe he's happy  
So quick to fire, never a liar in honesty  
It's hinged on a stranger thing  
Than friends or enemies  
From where comes the song I sing  
Anger in harmony  
Could he be in love again?  
You know that she's got the touch  
The thing is we're just good friends  
Smoke without fire don't mean too much  
Your trigger finger's itching on your loaded tongue  
But it's hinged on a stranger thing  
Than friends or enemies  
From where comes the song I sing  
Anger in harmony
