I could stand but I don't like the feeling  
I could fall but I'm always on the floor  
You could make a million staring at the ceiling  
You could break your back and still be poor  
  
One for the liar  
One for the cheat  
One for the man who you'll never meet  
Piece of the action and a portion of pie  
They'll be there waiting when your big chance comes by  
  
There's a snake on top of every ladder  
Who will tell you that he's your best friend  
Everyone important needs an adder  
But subtraction gets you in the end  
  
One for the liar  
One for the cheat  
One for the man who you'll never meet  
Piece of the action and a portion of pie  
They'll be there waiting when your big chance comes by  
  
They don't care they don't mind  
The in-betweens will steal you blind  
I don't know I can't say  
It seems its always been this way  
You won't feel or complain  
The gentle leech will cause no pain
