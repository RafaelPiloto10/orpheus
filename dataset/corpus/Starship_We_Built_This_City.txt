[Chorus]  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
Built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
Say you don't know me, or recognize my face  
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place  
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight  
Too many runaways eating up the night  
  
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone's always playing corporation games  
Who cares they're always changing corporation names  
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage  
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page  
  
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just another Sunday, in a tired old street  
Police have got the choke hold, oh, then we just lost the beat  
  
Who counts the money underneath the bar  
Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars  
Don't tell us you need us, 'cause we're just simple fools  
Looking for America, coming through your schools  
  
(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge  
Out on a gorgeous sunny Saturday and I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic)  
  
Don't you remember (remember)  
  
(Here's your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city  
The city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps)  
  
Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember  
We built this city, we built this city on rock an' roll  
  
[Chorus:Repeats x2]  
  
(We built, we built this city) built this city (we built, we built this city)  
(Repeats out)
