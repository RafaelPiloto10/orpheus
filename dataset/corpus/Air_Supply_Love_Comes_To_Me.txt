As long as I live all that I receive is what I want to give to you  
I know that if I can stay for a while you will soon love me too  
Let's take a chance at least we'll learn a lesson  
It beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days  
I don't want to love you in two different ways  
  
Do you want to give, do you want to give me you whole day and more  
Do you want to give, do you want always the key to the door  
It's easy for you talking your way out of all situations  
When you can't see thru' and leave it up to me  
And that's what I do  
And that's what I do  
  
  
Love comes to me and leaves me with you  
Love runs thru' me in all that you do  
Don't walk away, don't leave me standing here  
That's not the way, don't lead me anywhere  
I need you now, I need you now  
Don't leave me standing here  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
It's much too fast for me can't we go slow  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
What do you want me to do
