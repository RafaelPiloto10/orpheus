Feel too good to go to work today  
I need a little more time so i can stay this way  
Let's go for a ride on the circle line  
Couldn't you use a day in the sunshine  
Mustn't let your bank payments get behind  
The bills may pile up, i just brush them off my mind  
  
I can't let debt collectors bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just can't bring me down  
  
I can't remember when i felt so high  
My mind is on vacation and i don't know why  
Wouldn't you like to go for a country drive  
Doesn't it make you feel good to be alive  
Luncheon by the roadside will do just fine  
I left the water running  
It just must have slipped my mind  
  
Can't let the little things bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just can't bring me down  
Someone's bound to bring you down  
  
There's a strange speaking man on the front lawn  
Making rude noises and gestures  
It's just the neighbor's got something on his mind  
Feel too good  
I can't let frenchie start to bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just can't bring me down
