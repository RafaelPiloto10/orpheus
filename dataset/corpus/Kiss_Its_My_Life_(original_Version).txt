I gotta reputation,  
People know who I am.  
Rules are made to be broken,  
Can't kill what you don't understand.  
I see you runnin' scared,  
I never knew you cared.  
Go and hide yourself in the sand.  
Been to hell and back.  
I survived and that's a fact.  
(Chorus)  
It's my life.  
And I'll do what I wanna  
Do what I wanna,  
Do what I like.  
It's my life  
And I'll do what I wanna,  
Do what I wanna - do.  
My New Year's resolution,  
Is a always the same.  
Gonna do what I like,  
We're gonna do what I want,  
Cause it's just my way,  
Yeah!  
I don't live for tomorrow,  
Cause at the end of the day.  
Gonna shout it, from the roof.  
Betta face up to the truth.  
(Chorus)(Repeat twice)  
Ooh yeah!  
(Break)  
Don't need a invitation,  
I don't play hard-to-get.  
No!  
Well I'm fame they claim,  
I can't be tamed.  
Ya know it doesn't matter.  
I swear if I like,  
I wear what I want.  
(Chorus) (Repeat five times)
