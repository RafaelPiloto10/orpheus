Jesus Christ will resurrect  
He's got his bmi royalty to collect  
He's not the white fragile hippie  
He looks and acts more like an indignant ice-T  
Jesus Christ is coming back  
He wants to kick Mel Gibson's ass  
Superstar, The Passion of  
He wants his money, not your love  
  
He's been kickin' 2000 years  
He's fixed a lot of sports  
And drank a million beers  
Some ecstasy, a thin white line  
He says designer drugs beat the hell out of wine  
Jesus Christ on vacation  
Spreading mass sacreligion  
"Sex and drugs, we abstain"  
He thinks Christians are insane  
They don't know love,  
They know fear and moral hauteur  
Scare tactics I never taught  
"If you're gonna look to me,  
Better get rose colored shades,  
Cuz what you see is what you get"
