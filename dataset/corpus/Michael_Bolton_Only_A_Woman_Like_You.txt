It's beautiful, your honesty  
You cry when you need to  
You say what you feel  
You're never afraid to wear your heart on your sleeve  
You're always so open with me  
  
It's in your voice, I can hear it  
The sound of a woman in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Only a woman can love you so much  
Give you her life and give you her trust  
Not any woman can do what you do  
Only a woman like you  
  
It's magical, your love for me  
It's more than a man could ever receive  
I'm just a man and it's hard to believe  
A woman like you could love me  
  
It's in your eyes, I can see it  
The look of a woman in love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If only I could find the words to say  
But I just can't, so forgive me  
'Cause you took the words away  
You answered every prayer I always prayed  
  
It's in your touch, I can feel it  
The feeling of a woman in love  
  
[Chorus: x2]
