Let me hear the battle cry  
Calling on the wind  
Let me see the banners fly  
Before the storm begins  
  
Let me feel the spirits soar  
Destroy the enemy  
Striking at the evil core  
For all the world to see  
  
This day will last forever  
Deep in the hearts of men  
Courage and victory  
Remember, remember  
  
One shot at glory  
In the crossfire overhead  
Fate stands before me  
Words have all been said  
  
One shot at glory  
Driving hard and seeing red  
Destiny calls me  
One night of fire  
One shot at glory  
  
Fighting on with dignity  
In life and death we deal  
The power and the majesty  
Amidst the blood and steel  
  
I still hear the battle cry  
The call goes on and on  
I still see the banners fly  
The battle's always won
