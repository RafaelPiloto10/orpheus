I don't know why, was getting so good with us,  
I don't know why, was getting so good with us,  
I don't know why, was getting so good,  
Was getting so good with us.  
  
I don't know why, was so good with us.  
  
The room's so empty, the room's empty without you,  
My body's so empty, the world's so empty without you.  
  
I don't know why,  
I don't know why,  
I don't know why,  
I don't know why, 'twas so good with us.  
  
You left me, you left me, you left me without words,  
You left me, you left me, you left me without words,  
You left me, you left me, you left me without words.  
  
You bastards!  
Hate us! hate me! we had ev'rything you
