Pack up  
I'm strayed  
Enough  
  
Oh say say say  
Oh say say say  
Oh say say say  
Oh say say say  
Oh say say say  
  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Maps  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
  
Made off  
Don't stray  
My kind's your kind  
I'll stay the same  
Pack up  
Don't stray  
Oh say say say  
Oh say say say  
  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Maps  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Maps  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Maps  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you  
Maps  
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
