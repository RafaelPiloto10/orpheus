Danger in the shape of somethin'  
Wild  
Stranger dressed in black, she's a  
Hungry child  
No one knows who she is or what  
Her name is  
I don't know where she came from  
Or what her game is

(Hot child in the city)  
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)  
(Hot child in the city)  
  
So young to be loose and on her  
Own  
Young boys, they all want to take  
Her home  
She goes downtown, the boys all  
Stop and stare  
When she goes downtown, she walks  
Like she just don't care, care  
  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)  
Yeah  
(Hot child in the city)  
  
Come on down to my place, baby  
We'll talk about love  
Come on down to my place, woman  
We'll make love!  
  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)  
She's kinda dangerous  
(Hot child in the city)  
Young child  
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)  
Young child, runnin' wild  
(Hot child in the city)  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)  
Hot child in the city
