It ain't nothing that make you want it  
Get your tipsy, a little blonde  
I pull up and I ask for honey  
Fucked up, feeling not upon it  
  
[Hook:]  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I  
  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I  
You know what I came to do for you, girls  
  
For all my ladies  
For all my ladies  
  
[Verse:]  
Baby you're so damn beautiful  
When I, how many like it?  
I love your smile  
And the way that you move  
Baby you and I have a minute  
Girl I promise I won't waste your time  
Cause I know you're kinda busy  
Physically yours  
I'm just tryna say, it's you caught my eye  
I need you need love  
I'm tryna give it  
And if you don't trust me  
I'll show you, I'm a man of my word, girl  
And if you're ready for the world  
I'll give it to you  
I'm so in love like...  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
It ain't nothing that make you want it  
Get your tipsy, a little blonde  
I pull up and I ask for honey  
Fucked up, feeling not upon it  
  
[Hook:]  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I  
  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I  
You know what I came to do for you, girls  
  
For all my ladies  
For all my ladies  
To all my ladies  
  
[Akon]  
See I get what you want  
And I get what you don't  
I'm the man of the year  
He's just the man of the morn  
A hundred stacks in the trunk  
She got a 100 packs in the donk  
If he even tell you to fuck with real niggas  
Than I'm the type that you want  
So I just stopped to get in money while these niggas need a loan  
Why you fucking with these dummies, we need to be alone  
Cause I'm wanting you baby  
So what to do?  
Cause I wanna change your life  
Me and you  
  
[Hook:]  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I  
  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I came to do  
  
You know what I came to do, you  
You know what I  
You know what I came to do for you, girls  
  
For all my ladies  
For all my ladies  
To all my ladies
