If heartaches brought fame  
In loves crazy game  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
If they gave gold statuettes  
For tears and regrets  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
But they don't give awards  
And there's no praise or fame  
For a heart that's been broken  
Over love that's in vain  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Everyone would know my name  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Everyone would know my name  
I'd be a legend in my time
