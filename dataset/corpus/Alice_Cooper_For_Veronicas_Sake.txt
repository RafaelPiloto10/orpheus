I got a name and number  
I got a bed assigned  
I got a dog in the city pound  
that I left behind  
I'm strapped down and wild eyed  
she's locked up in a pen  
she needs somebody to feed her  
and i'm her only friend  
so for Veronica's sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronica's sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here  
We both been put in cages  
we got our shots and tags  
I got my sweating fist to shake  
she's got her tail to wag  
she has to bark and whimper  
while I can scream and shout  
the clock above the psycho ward  
says time is running out  
so for Veronica's sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronica's sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get myself out of here  
And I can hear her howling all night  
at the lonely moon  
They're gonna give her the gas  
if I don't get there soon  
I gotta get there soon  
For Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here  
for Veronica's sake she can get pretty weird  
for Veronica's sake I gotta get out of here.
