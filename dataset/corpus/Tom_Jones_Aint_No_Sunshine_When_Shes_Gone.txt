Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
She's gone much too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
  
I know  
She's gone to stay  
It's breakin' me up  
Anytime she goes away  
Gotta leave the young thing alone  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's gone much too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
I wonder if she's gone to stay  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't a home  
Any time she goes away  
  
I know  
She's gone to stay  
It's breaking me up  
Any time she goes away  
Gotta leave the young thing alone  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
I wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
Any time she goes away
