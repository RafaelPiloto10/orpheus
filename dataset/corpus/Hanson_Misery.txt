This time I won't take you back  
Something's come into you  
This time I'm gonna breathe a breath  
Walking on down the road  
  
I could never promise that you'll never be lonely  
But as long as we're together, we can always only be  
Misery, doe, doe, doe, doe, doe  
  
Last night I got off the fence  
'Cause I won't be the fool  
This side the grass is greener than  
The garden that I used to grow  
Walking on down the road  
  
I could never promise that you'll never be lonely  
But as long as we're together, we can always only be  
Misery, doe, doe, doe, doe, doe  
Misery, misery  
  
I could never promise that you'll never be lonely  
But as long as we're together, we can always only be  
Misery, yeah, doe, doe, doe, doe, doe  
  
Misery, misery  
This time I won't take you back  
I won't be the fool
