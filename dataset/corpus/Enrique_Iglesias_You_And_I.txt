You and I  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
All I need is your hand  
And your heart  
  
Let's be free  
Run away from it all  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Here we are  
Face to face  
One more time  
  
In the light  
In the dark  
We will shine  
  
There's nobody, we're alone-lone-lone  
Take all of your worries, let them go, let them go  
I'll bring you to a place that only we know tonight  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
here we are  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Oh, we go higher baby  
Oh, we go higher baby
