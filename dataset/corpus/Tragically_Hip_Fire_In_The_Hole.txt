You triumphed over will  
You had immunity to kill  
You had your dreams fulfilled  
And I love you still  
But there's a power beyond control  
There's a fire in the hole  
Ah the nights are getting cold  
All your secrets will be told  
Turn your lanterns low  
  
As long as you can dig up proof  
As cold as water through the roof  
Brutal as depicted truth  
That kid's a fuckin goof  
Turn your lanterns low  
But there's a power beyond control  
There's a fire in the hole  
Yeah the nights are getting cold  
All his secrets will be told  
Turn your lanterns low  
Alright  
  
I'd like to stand up soon and show  
I'd like to let some people know  
I'd turn my bucket over  
I'd turn my lantern low  
But there's a power beyond control  
There's a fire in the hole  
Yeah the nights are getting cold  
All my secrets would be told  
Turn your lanterns low  
Alright  
Alright
