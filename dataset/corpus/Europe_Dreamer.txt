He is down by the riverside  
Late one night  
He's tryin' to count the stars  
In each of the signs  
All alone by the riverside  
  
And time passes by  
Gathering thoughts of the past  
And maybe he'll cry  
  
So they say he's a madman  
And he don't understand  
But I know that he's tryin' hard  
To act like a man  
All those years he has suffered,  
My friends  
  
All those years of pain  
But I don't think he knows for sure  
If those years were in vain  
He's a dreamer  
  
And he's fightin' for his life  
He's tryin' to understand  
He's a dreamer  
  
But he wants to carry on  
Yet I know he's a lonely man
