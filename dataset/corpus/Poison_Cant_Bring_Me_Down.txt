My chick is driving me crazy  
She thinks that I'm lazy  
Just because I'm good at nothing all day  
  
My baby don't get it  
So my job, I quit it  
Bust my ass,  
Hell I barely get paid  
  
People like to put me down  
And just because I hang around  
Don't they understand it's my way?  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody tries to break me  
Say they love me when they hate me  
Baby you just can't bring me down  
I've seen long and lonely days  
And I have lost and found my ways  
So baby you just can't bring me down  
  
Yeah, bring me down  
  
Baby I'm leaving  
You've got my heart bleeding  
So I'm taking the easier way out  
  
The angel in my head  
Is now the devil in my bed  
If my walls could talk they would shout  
  
Baby you can talk and talk  
The hurt you caused, it just don't stop  
I think I'm going out of my brain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got a car, it go fast  
Cute fuzzy dice up on the dash  
Got a bumper sticker, just say "peace"  
Keep a gun under my seat  
To protect me from the pain  
Should your words get in my brain  
Can't you love me just the same  
Can't you love me just the  
  
[Chorus]
