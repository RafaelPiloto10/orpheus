Somebody told me once, that pain is a game we all gotta play,  
But while am I in overtime... every other day.  
I know that for all the good in life it's a price we all gotta pay,  
But I paid till I poked and I still don't know what it is to have a good day.  
And everybody knows what it is that I need to do,  
Well, do me a favor let me worry about me and you worry about you!  
I don't need no one to put me down,  
I'm on the ground, can't...  
I don't need no one to hack around and make...  
Just makes me look older!  
I don't need no one to block my eyes, and tell me lies
