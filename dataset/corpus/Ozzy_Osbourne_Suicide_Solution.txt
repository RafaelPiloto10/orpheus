Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows  
  
Evil thoughts and evil doings  
Cold, alone you hang in ruins  
Thought that you'd escape the reaper  
You can't escape the Master Keeper  
  
'Cause you feel like you're living a lie  
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why  
Then you ask from your cask us there life after birth  
What you sow can mean Hell on this earth  
  
Now you live inside a bottle  
The reaper's traveling at full throttle  
It's catching you but you don't see  
The reaper is you and the reaper is me  
  
Breaking laws, knocking doors  
But there's no one at home  
Made your bed, rest your head  
But you lie there and moan  
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out  
Don't you know what it's really about  
  
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows
