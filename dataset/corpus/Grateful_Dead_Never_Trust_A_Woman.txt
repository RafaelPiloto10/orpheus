Gonna see some good times  
Gonna get to ring that bell  
Gonna see some good times  
Sometimes you make up  
For when I'm not feeling well  
I must be due some great times  
'Cause right now  
'Cause right now I feel like hell  
Never trust a woman  
Who wears her pants too tight  
Never trust a woman  
Who wears her pants too tight  
She might love you tomorrow  
But she'll be gone tomorrow night  
I say, come tomorrow, I'll get my pay  
And I'm gonna leave this town  
Come tomorrow, I'll get my pay  
And I'm gonna leave this fucking town  
She don't really love me  
Ain't no reason to stick around  
Gonna see some good times  
Gonna get to ring that bell  
Gonna see some good times  
Sometimes you make up  
For when I'm not feeling well  
I must be due some great times  
But if they don't come, if they don't come  
If they never come around, what the hell
