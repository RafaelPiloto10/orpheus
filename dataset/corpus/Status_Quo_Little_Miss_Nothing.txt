People all around they look at you, and I have seen them sneer  
But they don't realise how much I need you, so let me make it very clear  
That you won't have to worry just 'cos your clothes are torn  
  
Your windows they need cleaning and the weeds are growing high  
But Little Miss Nothing I won't pass you by  
  
You have no daddy to tell your troubles to, but don't you worry I'll share  
them with you  
We won't worry about the stormy weather, if you have troubles we'll share  
them together  
Your house is nearly falling, but I'll change all that for you  
  
Your windows they need cleaning and the weeds are growing high  
But Little Miss Nothing I won't pass you by  
Now I will clean your windows, cut the weeds from high to low  
I will mend your rooftops, and the taps again will flow  
But Little Miss Nothing I won't let you go
