Lil' darlin', gotta go now  
Don't know when I'll be coming back  
Got my future all planned out  
Got my bags packed  
Things don't always turn out right  
But that's just the way it goes  
Before I leave you there's just a few  
Things you should know  
Don't talk to strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember God, He made you  
And one day He'll make everything alright  
Don't cross on the yellow  
You always got to wait for a green light  
Remember God, He made you  
And one day He'll make everything alright  
Lil' darlin', gotta go now  
Don't worry, you'll be just fine  
When it comes to good luck  
I just know you'll always be first in line  
Nobody will ever love you  
As much as I do  
But that doesn't mean  
Other people won't love you, too  
Don't talk to strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember God, He made you  
And one day He'll make everything alright
