Sipping coffee at a quarter to two  
I wake up and I'm dallin' and my minds running to you  
No wonder I'm a one woman man  
She keeps me hot in a jar on the nightstand  
I should tell her that she couldn't be more  
Opposite then a foot in a door,  
There's no one else I would rather go out with, thats hell when I see them
standing there  
Me and my mouth we don't mean to be rushing  
We talk about deep freely cause we crushing  
I want to shake both sides of the brush ya  
Theatrically I say we rock it  
  
And when the coyotes, they sing in the park  
It's when the city lights start fallin' for the sea  
While them roads are windin' down  
And the flying men'll hit the ground  
Every motion is close to the touch  
And the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'  
  
Coming back for more,  
You know I'm coming for you  
You know we should be should be together  
While we rock, we won't put a stop  
Not today not tomorrow.  
You better lock your doors  
You know why, cause we want you  
'Cause when I kill a liar  
  
I wish the world was a live like you.  
I wish the world would help me through  
Another repetuity to approach you  
Another telepathic rendezvous  
I wish you would walk when your jogging  
You got a duty to sell in Mexico  
I got to try to keep you acting shady  
I don't like liking you when you walk because  
I gotta figure out the snooze alarm  
I want'a lay in a place till dawn  
I want'a play in the park come on  
Now let me see ya alarm in the lesh hello  
  
And when the coyotes escape to New York  
Then the city lights has crumbles to the sea  
And the girls turned it into lost and found  
The flying metal hit the ground  
Every motion is closer to touching the coyotes singing  
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your loving  
  
You know I will come for you  
You know we should be, we should be together,  
Because once we work we want to stop  
Not today or tomorrow  
  
Because once we work we want to stop  
Not today or tomorrow  
  
You know I will come for you  
You know we should be, we should be together,  
Because once we work we want to stop  
Not today or tomorrow
