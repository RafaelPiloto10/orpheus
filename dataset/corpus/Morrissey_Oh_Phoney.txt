May this lovely letter  
Reach its destination  
If only  
Question one is why do you  
Pretend that you like me?  
Oh Phoney  
See how the outside  
Contradicts what's inside  
Oh ooh  
  
Who can make Hitler  
Seem like a bus conductor?  
You do, oh Phoney you do  
  
You sing a lovely song to a scale  
And the words spell out my name  
Oh Phoney  
But then you kick me down below  
Cause you know it won't show  
How could you?  
  
See how the outside  
Contradicts what's inside  
Oh ooh  
  
Who can make Hitler  
Seem like a bus conductor?  
  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do
