I know the sound of each rock and stone  
And I embrace what others fear  
You are not to roam in this forgotten place  
Just the likes of me are welcome here  
  
Everything breathes and I know each breath  
For me it means life, for others, it's death  
It's perfectly in balance, perfectly planned  
More than enough for this man  
  
Like every tree, stands on it's own  
Reaching for the sky, I stand alone  
I share my world with no one else  
All by myself, I stand alone  
  
I seen your world with these very eyes  
Don't come any closer, don't even try  
I've felt all the pain and heard all the lies  
But in my world there's no compromise  
  
Like every tree, stands on it's own  
Reaching for the sky, I stand alone  
I share my world with no one else  
All by myself, I stand alone  
  
All by myself, I stand alone  
All by myself, I stand alone
