Au revoir, auf wiedersehen  
You won't see another morning  
You won't see another evening  
Good night  
  
Buenos noches o senor  
Senorita see ya later  
Buenos noches bye-bye  
There are many here among us  
  
You feel that life is a joke  
And for you we sing this final song  
For you there is no hope  
Sayonara oh suicide hari kari  
Kamikaze you won't  
See another evening  
  
Goodbye  
Bye-bye so long, farewell  
See you later, suicide  
Suicide  
Suicide  
Suicide
