Let's fall in love  
Why shouldn't we fall in love?  
Our hearts are made of it  
Let's take a chance  
Why be afraid of it?  
Let's close our eyes  
And make our own paradise  
Little we know of it  
Still we can try  
To make a go of it  
We might have been meant for each other  
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover  
Let's fall in love  
Why shouldn't we fall in love?  
Now is the time for it  
While we are young  
Let's fall in love  
We might have been meant for each other  
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover  
Let's fall in love  
Why shouldn't we fall in love?  
Now is the time for it  
While we are young  
Let's fall in love
