Say that you like me the way I am  
Just take some time out to understand  
It may not be much, but I do all I can  
Say something nice  
  
I'd never do it to one of you  
I'd say something nice if it wasn't true  
I'd make you feel better when you're feeling blue  
I'd say something nice  
  
Say something nice, only once or twice  
Say something nice, only once or twice  
Say something nice  
  
I want to hear that I'm beautiful  
But you wouldn't say it even if I were  
Wearing my diamonds and a coat of fur  
You wouldn't say nothin' nice  
  
Tell me you think that my hair's real nice  
Don't stand around and just criticize  
Can't you understand that when a person tries  
You say something nice  
  
And it's oh so hard, oh so hard  
To listen to the words that you say  
Oh, say something nice, just once or twice  
It wouldn't hurt, don't you see  
  
I want to hear something nice, say something nice  
Say something nice, just once or twice  
It don't hurt you at all, say something nice  
  
Say something nice baby, only once or twice  
Say something nice  
Say something nice baby, only once or twice  
Say something nice  
  
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me  
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me  
  
Say something nice  
Say something nice  
And it's oh so hard, and it's oh so hard  
And I'm dying to hear what I've never heard (fade out)
