Angel,  
Put sad wings around me now  
Protect me from this world of sin  
So that we can rise again  
  
Oh angel,  
We can find our way somehow  
Escaping from the world we're in  
To a place where we began  
And I know we'll find  
A better place and piece of mind  
Just tell me that it's all you want  
For you and me  
  
Angel won't you set me free  
Angel,  
Remember how we chased the sun  
Then reaching for the stars at night  
As our lives had just begun  
When I close my eyes  
I hear your velvet wings and cry  
I'm waiting here with open arms  
Oh can't you see  
Angel shine your light on me  
  
Angel we'll meet once more I'll pray  
When all my sins are washed away  
Hold me inside your wings and stay  
Angel take me far away  
  
Put your sad wings around me now  
Angel take me far away  
Put sad wings around me now  
So that we can rise again  
Put sad wings around me now  
Angel take me far away  
Put sad wings around me now  
So that we can rise again
