uh, it's the d-d-d-d d-d-d-d d-d-d-d-d-d-damn ha-ha yea  
  
[Chorus]  
Damn-it's the way he grabs on himself when he gettin closer to them girls be
like  
Damn-it's the wife beater wish you were in the droptop cruisin hoes like  
Damn-I can't blame em' if he wasn't mine shit i would try and claim him,  
'Cause he's so fly and i'm so fly and you'll fool  
yourself if you try to deny him  
  
I'm nothin like them other brothers  
I got no choice but to slut her  
'Cause I'm in a 10-6 with the vase up that look somethin like a nutta butta
dutta dutta  
Mami you'll be in saint tropez  
  
Ridin jet skis and mopeds  
Powderin like dope heads  
Paparazzi snappin pictures they must thin you J.Lopez(BIATCH!!!)  
(Ha-ha)lets roast some spinach  
  
find a club and just post up in it  
what you mean are we there yet,I got lear jets that get to the westcoast in
minutes  
(ha-ha)I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge  
with white vanilla studs  
  
'Cause if they witnessed how I'm killin em out here these just might go tell
the judge  
(I rest my case)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
you could be prancin through ghettos  
in a pair of fendi's or pants and stillettos  
all you gotta do is swallow some kids like that witch did in Hansel and Gretel  
who's as handsome as ghetto  
  
this mans earings look transparent  
and my mtchell and s throwbacks be so old they could be somebodys grandparents  
I want the type of money athletes consume  
I have to assume  
  
I'm no fool,but I'm so cool,when i walk in feels like there's a draft in the
room  
(oooh)I'm so sick i drive em reverse fast  
call me a nurse fast  
shorty just lay back in the made back it'll make you feel like you sittin in
first class  
(Relax)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They ask for it  
so i put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard  
and you gotta catch it on tape 'cause when the truck stops rims still look
like they on fast forward  
i'm sippin liquor the color of smurf's skin as long as the earth spins  
  
and you'll get sea sick,'cause my waves be thick enough for them cali dudes to
surf in  
(cowabunga)ya low ridin denims  
look like midgets is hidin in em  
they say I like it from the front I like it from the front but oly when the
kid is slidin in em  
the biggest dikes be switchin for dudes with figures like me  
and um I'm not braggin,but just imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga
like me  
(BIATCH!!!)  
  
[Chorus]
