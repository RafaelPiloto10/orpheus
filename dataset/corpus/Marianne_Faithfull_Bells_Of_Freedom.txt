Way across the deep blue ocean  
Way above the mountain so high  
People sing and loitering's freely  
Songs of joy reach up to the sky.  
In this time of worry and confusion  
In this world of trouble and pain  
We're so many and the road is so weary,  
How many people can tell you my name ?  
Bells of freedom ring  
Bells of freedom ring.  
Come friends and people from every corner,  
People, come from everywhere.  
Let the bells of freedom ring loudly,  
Ring for those who know and care.  
Bells of freedom ring  
Bells of freedom ring.  
Way across the deep blue ocean  
Way above the mountain so high  
People sing and loitering's freely  
Songs of joy reach up to the sky.  
Bells of freedom ring  
Bells of freedom ring for us.
