I couldn't live  
I couldn't live without your love  
For one kiss  
Well I'd give everything up  
There's no words I can describe  
What I feel deep inside  
So I let this song say it all  
  
Then I hope you'll understand  
Once you've listened 'till the end  
  
Heard the music in my head  
So before I could forget  
  
I start singing  
Yeah I was singing  
This song  
For you  
  
Just made up the words  
La la la oh, oh, yeah  
My heart with a melody  
  
So I am singing  
This song  
For you
