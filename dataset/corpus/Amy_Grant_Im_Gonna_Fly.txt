All my my friends are happy to stay  
Here in this yard day after day  
But something inside me has called me away  
I don't understand but I know I can't stay  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I'm lighter than air  
  
Cause I have felt for the first time  
I can be myself  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile and a dream that's mine  
Even if I am the only one who wants to fly  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I soar through the air  
  
All of my life seems I've waited  
For the time to start  
Being the person inside of me  
Unafraid of being me  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile and a dream that's mine  
Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly  
  
If I had my life to live over again  
I'd run bare foot, relax a bit more  
And I'd talk to more children  
And I'd learn how they laugh  
And I'd teach them how I've learned to fly  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I'm lighter than air  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I soar through the air  
  
Cause all of my life seems I've waited  
For the time to start  
Being the person inside of me  
Unafraid of being me  
Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly  
I'm gonna fly
