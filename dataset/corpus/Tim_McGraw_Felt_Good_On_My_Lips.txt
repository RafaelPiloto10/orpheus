She said her name was a hand me down name  
From the side of a family that long ago came  
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain  
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.  
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips.  
  
She tipped the D.J. to play her favorite song  
A Spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong  
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on  
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it  
I don't know what it meant, but it felt good on my lips.  
  
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy  
You can go crazy too  
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy  
I wanna go crazy with you  
  
Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is  
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips  
  
She ordered us a drink  
It was a purple kind of pink  
She said it's got a shot of a little bit of everything  
Little yellow umbrella for a fella like me  
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with  
But I took a sip  
Yeah it felt good on my lips  
  
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy  
You can go crazy too  
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy  
I wanna go crazy with you  
  
Everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is  
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips  
  
When the lights came on and they hollered last call  
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss  
In a little corner booth how do I know talk  
She leaned in close and gave me one long and wet  
A goodnight goodbye kiss  
And it felt good on my lips  
  
Whoa how sweet it is  
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips  
Whoa how sweet it is  
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
