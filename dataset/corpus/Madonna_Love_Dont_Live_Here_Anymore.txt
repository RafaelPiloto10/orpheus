You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
When you lived inside of me  
There was nothing I could conceive  
That you wouldn't do for me  
Trouble seemed so far away  
You changed that right away, baby  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just emptiness and memories  
Of what we had before  
You went away  
Found another place to stay, another home  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
You're the windmills of my eyes  
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me  
Why'd ya have to go away (away)  
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
(Love don't live here anymore)  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Live here anymore  
Love don't live here anymore  
Love don't live here anymore  
No no don't, don't live live here anymore  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
No it don't live here anymore  
Love, don't, live here (love don't live here anymore )  
Anymore  
It don't live here anymore
