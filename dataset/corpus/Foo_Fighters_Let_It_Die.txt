A heart of gold  
But it lost it's pride  
Beautiful veins  
And bloodshot eyes  
I see your face  
In another light  
  
[Chorus]  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
In too deep  
And out of time  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
  
A simple man  
And his blushing bride  
(Why'd you have to go)  
(And let it die)  
Intravenous  
Intertwined  
(Why'd you have to go)  
(And let it die)  
Hearts gone cold  
Your hands were tied  
(Why'd you have to go)  
(And let it die)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you ever think of me  
You're so considerate  
Did you ever think of me  
Oh so considerate  
  
In too deep  
And lost in time  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Beautiful veins  
And bloodshot eyes  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Hearts gone cold  
And hands are tied  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
  
Do you ever think of me  
You're so considerate  
Did you ever think of me  
Oh so considerate  
  
In too deep  
And lost in time  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Beautiful veins  
And bloodshot eyes  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Hearts gone cold  
And hands are tied  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let this die  
Why'd you have to go  
And let it die
