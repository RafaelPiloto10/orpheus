Living in a rabbit tunnel  
Keep the doggy in her kennel  
Mustn't let her see the world  
Oh, no!  
Don't treat her like that  
Oh, no!  
Don't treat her like that  
Leaving after mom and daddy  
Carry home just like a cat, he  
Mustn't let them see your kill  
Shout it clear for all to hear  
You won't shoot this bird down  
Shout it clear for all to hear  
We're going to take this town  
(Turn and done bridge give the orders)  
(Keeping lunch in perfect orders)  
Mustn't let them know their minds  
(Turning on too early music)  
(Bring up on each other that they)  
Mustn't let them over the lines  
It's time she stopped being your ornament  
It's time she put it in the past for permanent  
You can't hold her if she wants to roam around  
Around around around around  
You can't hold her dreamin', keep her gagged and bound  
Gagged and bound  
We're going  
We're going to  
We're going to take  
We're going to take this  
We're going to take this
