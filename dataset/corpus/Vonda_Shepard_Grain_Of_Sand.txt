I feel like I'm walking on a mine  
I'm gonna leave it all behind  
I feel like I'm gaining my soul  
While I'm losing my mind  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
  
I'm gonna walk through that door  
I'm gonna see what it's there for  
'Cause all I ever want is your skin or your soul, baby  
But you couldn't give me either one of those  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
  
You use to hold me like a flower  
We used to talk for seven hours  
I see the bigger picture now  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
And I feel like a grain of sand
