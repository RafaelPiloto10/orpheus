I wanna be drunk when I wake up  
On the right side of the wrong bed  
And never in a excuse I made up  
Tell you the truth I hate  
What didn't kill me  
It never made me stronger at all.  
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me  
So now I'll maybe leave back there  
I'm sat here wishing I was sober  
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.  
  
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating  
Without you to hold I'll be freezing  
Can't rely on my heart to beating  
'Cause you take part of it every evening  
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
  
I wanna hold your heart in both hands  
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can  
And I've got no plans for the weekend  
So shall we speak then  
Keep it between friends  
No, I know you'll never love me like you used to.  
  
But may be other people like us  
Who see the flicker of the clip when they light up  
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before  
You don't hold me anymore.  
  
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name  
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake  
You know I can't change as I began saying  
You cut me wide open like landscape  
Open bottles of beer but never champagne  
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.  
  
All by myself  
I'm here again  
All by myself  
You know I'll never change  
All by myself  
All by myself  
I'm just drunk, again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.
