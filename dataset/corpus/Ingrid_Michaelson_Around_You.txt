I call you my friend  
And that's all that I knew  
Why do I have to pretend  
To find ways to be around you?  
You've been there all along  
Holding my hand like you do  
Why do I feel that it's wrong  
To love to be around you?  
And I think I'm losing my mind  
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beauty  
And you have a sweet sinful smile, I'm in trouble  
'Cause you turn me upside down and around and around  
Do you feel what I feel? Well?  
Do you feel this way too?  
That every wound seems to heal when I am around you  
And I must be losing my mind  
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beauty  
And you have a sweet sinful smile, I'm in trouble  
'Cause you turn me upside down and around and around and around  
And I must be losing my mind  
Maybe you have a sweet sinful smile, I'm in trouble  
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around  
Turn me upside down and around and around  
Turn me upside down and around and around  
My feet don't touch the ground  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you, you, you, you, you
