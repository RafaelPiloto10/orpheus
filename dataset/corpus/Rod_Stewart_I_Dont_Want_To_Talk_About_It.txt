I can tell by your eyes that you've probably been cryin' forever  
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror  
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, my heart?  
  
If I stand all alone, will the shadows hide the colors of my heart  
Blue for the tears, black for the night  
The stars in the sky don't mean nothin' to you, they're a mirror  
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, my heart  
My heart, this so heard  
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart  
  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, whoa, my heart?  
My heart, whoa, my heart
