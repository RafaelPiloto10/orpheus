I know my street , that's where I live  
I never take , I always give  
They always leave me on the shelf  
I live my life all by myself  
My car ain't big , I can't go fast  
And ev'ry drink I take's the last  
I'm always tryin' to save my health  
I live my life all by myself  
Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me  
I'm a man who stands alone  
That's where I'll be  
That's where I'll be  
So take your hand down off my chair  
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there  
And I ain't neve seen no wealth  
I live my live all by myself  
My car ain't big , I can't go fast  
And ev'ry drink I take's the last  
I'm always tryin' to save my health  
I live my life all by myself  
Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me  
I'm a man who stands alone  
That's where I'll be  
That's where I'll be  
That's where I'll be  
So take your hand down off my chair  
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there  
And I ain't never seen no wealth  
I live my live all by myself  
I live my life all by myself
