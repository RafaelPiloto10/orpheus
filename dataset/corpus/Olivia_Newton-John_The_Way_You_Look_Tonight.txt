Someday when I'm awfully low  
When the world is cold  
I will feel a glow just thinking of you  
And the way you look tonight  
Oh but you're lovely  
With your smile so warm  
And your cheek so soft  
There is nothing for me but to love you  
Just the way you look tonight  
With each word my tenderness grows  
Tearing my fear apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose  
Touches my foolish heart  
Lovely, never, never change  
Keep that breathless charm  
Won't you please arrange it cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight
