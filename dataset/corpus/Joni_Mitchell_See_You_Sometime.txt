Where are you now  
Are you in some hotel room  
Does it have a view?  
Are you caught in a crowd  
Or holding some honey  
Who came on to you?  
Why do you have to be so jive  
O.K. hang up the phone  
It hurts  
But something survives  
Though it's undermined  
I'd still like to see you sometime  
  
I'm feeling so good  
And my friends all tell me  
That I'm looking fine  
I run in the woods  
I spring from the boulders  
Like a mama lion  
I'm not ready to  
Change my name again  
But you know I'm not after  
A piece of your fortune  
And your fame  
'Cause I tasted mine  
I'd just like to see you sometime  
  
Pack your suspenders  
I'll come meet your plane  
No need to surrender  
I just want to see you again  
  
We're in for more rain  
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees  
It seems such a shame  
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly  
I couldn't take them all on then  
With a heedful of questions and hypes  
So when the hopes got so slim  
I just resigned  
But I'd still like to see you sometime  
I'd sure like to see you
