Maybe I was wrong  
Maybe you were right  
Maybe I don't listen  
Like I should  
Maybe when I don't  
Don't come home at night  
It tends to bother you  
Maybe I could start  
Answering a page  
Call if I'd be late  
That'd be good  
What I'm trying to say  
Is that I'm gonna try  
And do better for you  
  
I'm aware  
That they're some faults  
In this relationship  
Where I could try  
A bit harder than I do  
And so I'm telling you  
  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect  
Just don't give up on me  
You will see  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
  
Maybe I don't ask  
You about your day  
Maybe I act  
Like I don't care  
Girl I really do  
I just got a whole lot  
On my mind right now  
Baby, I don't want  
You to go away  
Everything is wrong  
If you're not there  
Tell me what you want  
And I'm gonna try  
To give it all  
To you somehow  
  
I'm aware  
That they're some faults  
In this relationship  
Where I could try  
A bit harder than I do  
And so I'm telling you  
  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect  
Just don't give up on me  
You will see  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
  
I know  
You can do  
Better than me  
But I don't want  
Nobody but you  
And I know  
You don't think  
I appreciate you  
Let me show you  
That is not true  
  
(2x):  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect  
Just don't give up on me  
You will see  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect  
Just don't give up on me  
You will see  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl
