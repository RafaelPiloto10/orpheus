When the night has come  
And the land is dark,  
And the moon is the only light we'll see.  
Well I won't be afraid,  
No, I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you stand  
Stand by me.  
So darling, darling stand by me  
Won't You stand by me  
Just as long as you stand, Stand by me.  
When the sky that we look upon tumble and falls  
And the mountains crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry  
No I won't shed a tear,  
Just as long as you stand  
Stand by me.  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand Won't You Stand Stand By Me  
When the night has come  
And the land is dark,  
And the moon is the only light we'll see.  
I won't cry, No I won't cry  
No I won't shed a tear,  
Just as long as you fuckin' Stand by me.  
Darling, darling stand by me

Oh Won't You Stand Won't You Stand Stand By Me  
When the sky that we look upon crumble and falls  
And the mountains tumble to the sea  
I won't cry, No I won't cry  
No, I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you fuckin' Stand by me.
