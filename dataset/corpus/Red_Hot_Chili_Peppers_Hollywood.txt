Take me back  
Hold my hand  
All the way back  
To the brotherland  
Take me back  
I want to go back  
  
Take me back  
And my funky ass band  
All the way back  
To the brotherland  
Take me back  
  
I want to go  
As fast as I can  
Slidin' on back  
To the brotherland  
Now children  
Hollywood...  
  
I want to get up and go  
With my funky ass jams  
All the way back  
To the broherland  
Take me back  
I want to go back  
  
Hollywood...  
  
Where the women  
Is the women  
And the man  
Is the man  
  
I want to go  
As fast as I can  
Slidin' on back  
To the brotherland  
Now children
