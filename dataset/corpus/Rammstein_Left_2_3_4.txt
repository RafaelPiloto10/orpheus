Can you break hearts  
Can hearts speak  
Can you torture hearts  
Can you steal hearts  
They want my heart on the right spot  
But then I look below  
Then it beats left  
Can hearts sing  
Can a heart burst  
Can hearts be pure  
Can a heart be made of stone  
They want my heart on the right spot  
But then I look below  
Then it beats left two three four left  
Can you ask hearts  
Can you carry a child under yourself  
Can you give it away  
Can you think with your heart  
They want my heart on the right spot  
But then I look below  
Then it beats in the left breast  
The envious have not known it well  
Left two three four left
