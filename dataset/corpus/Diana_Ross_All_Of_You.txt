I've never had this feeling before  
I've never wanted anyone more  
And something in your eyes tells me  
You feel the way that I do  
(I feel like you do)  
  
If you would like to stay here all night  
You know that I would say  
It's all right  
'Though I'm saying yes  
I confess  
I've got more on my mind  
'Cause I want more of you  
Than your time  
  
All of you, your body and soul  
Every kind of love you can express  
All the secret dreams you've never told  
I want everything  
And I'll take nothing less  
All of you as long as you live  
Everything you've never shared before  
I want all of you that you can give  
All your joys and all your sorrows  
Your todays and your tomorrows  
  
How I long to feel the warmth of your touch  
And then if I'm not asking too much  
I'd like to spend my life wand'ring through  
All the wonders of you  
  
And when we're lying close in the dark  
So close I feel each beat of your heart  
I want you to reveal what you feel  
All you hold deep inside  
There is nothing I want you to hide  
  
All of you, your body and soul  
Everything you want this love to be  
I want all of you  
All that you can give  
And in return for all your giving  
Let me give you all of me  
  
All of you, your body and soul  
Every kind of love you can express  
All the secret dreams you've never told  
I want everything (everything) everything  
All of you as long as you live  
(As long as you live)  
Everything you want this love to be  
I want all of you  
All that you can give  
In return (in return) I wanna give you
