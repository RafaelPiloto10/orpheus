The love you leave  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Still be there after you're gone.  
  
The air you breathe  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Still be there after you're gone.  
  
The lochs and seas  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Still be there after you're gone.  
  
Three score years and ten of joy and pain  
Adds up to mayflies on the windowpane.  
The windowpane.  
  
The mystery  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Still be there after you're gone.  
  
The lochs and seas  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Will be there after you're gone.  
Still be there after you're gone.  
Gone.  
  
Aa-a-a-a  
Aa-a-a-a  
Ah Ah Ah Ah  
  
Aa-a-a-a  
Aa-a-a-a  
Ah Ah Ah Ah  
  
Aa-a-a-a
