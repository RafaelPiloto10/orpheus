The sun shines  
And people forget  
The spray flies as the speedboat glides  
And people forget  
Forget they're hiding  
The girls smile  
And people forget  
The snow packs as the skier tracks  
And people forget  
Forget they're hiding.  
  
Behind an eminence front  
Eminence front - It's a put on.  
  
Come on join the party  
Dress to kill  
Won't you come and join the party  
Dress to kill.  
  
The drinks flow  
People forget  
That big wheel spins, the hair thins  
People forget  
Forget they're hiding  
The news slows  
People forget  
The shares crash, hopes are dashed  
People forget  
Forget they're hiding.  
  
Behind an eminence front  
Eminence front - it's a put on  
Come on join the party  
Dress to  
Come on join the party  
Dress to  
Come on join the party  
Dress to  
Come on join the party  
Dress to kill  
Dress yourself, dressed to kill.
