Come along with me  
To my little corner of the world  
Dream a little dream  
In my little corner of the world  
You'll soon forget  
That there's any other place  
Tonight, my love  
We'll share a sweet embrace  
And if you care to stay  
In my little corner of the world  
We'll ride away  
In my little corner of the world  
I always knew that I'd find someone like you  
So hop o'er to my little corner of the world  
  
And if you care to stay  
In our little corner of the world  
We could hide away  
In our little corner of the world  
We always knew that we'd find someone like you  
So hop o'er to our little corner of the world
