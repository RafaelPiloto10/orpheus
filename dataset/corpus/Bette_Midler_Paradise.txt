There is a land I know,  
Where lovers go, and flowers grow,  
Forever more.  
Where time is standing still,  
And lovers fill the quiet places,  
By the shore.  
  
We will cross the rainbow  
To a place where we'll be free,  
And he'll give his love to me.  
So I wait for the day,  
When he takes me away, to...  
  
Paradise.  
He'll take me by my hand.  
We'll walk along the sand.  
It's never-never land.  
Whoa-oo, whoa-oo, whoa.  
  
We'll build a castle there,  
Where we can share the happiness  
We've waited for.  
Where white flamingos fly,  
Away up high, and play above  
The ocean floor.  
  
We will climb a mountain  
To see our wonderland.  
Maybe now you'll understand  
Why I wait for the day,  
When he takes me away, to...  
  
Paradise.  
He'll take me by my hand.  
We'll walk along the sand.  
A never-never land.  
Whoa-oo, whoa-oo, whoa.  
  
I'll stand by him,  
Do right by him  
And I swear that I would die for him.  
Ohh, die for him.  
  
Paradise.  
He'll take me by my hand.  
We'll walk along the sand.  
It's never-never land.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
I'll stand by him,  
Do right by him.  
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand by him.  
Gonna do right, gonna do right by him.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.  
Oh, yeah...
