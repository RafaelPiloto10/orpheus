Hello hello ahh...  
Hello hello ahh...  
Hello hello ahh...  
Hello hello ahh...  
  
Coming from my work I'm tired  
I see you get on my bus  
Here I go again, a new attraction  
And I think I know you  
Something is familiar 'bout your face  
I move through the crowd so I can get a better look  
  
Hello hello  
I got what you're looking for  
Hello hello  
Can't you see me, hello  
Hello  
Everybody's looking for a crazy heart  
Can't you see me I'm here  
Beside you  
  
Weren't you the one who  
Spilled my long drink over at a bar  
Easy come, easy go I said and laughed  
Looking like a question mark you  
Stood there wondering what to do  
And I said to you "Don't you look to happy now"  
  
Hello hello...  
Hello hello  
Here I'm standing next to you  
Hello Hello  
I am an object, nothing new  
Talk to me you're looking strange  
Let me know if my presence is bothering you  
  
Hello Hello  
Everybody's looking  
How can't you see me  
  
Hello hello  
Everybody's searching  
How can't you see me  
  
Hello hello  
Everybody's looking  
How can't you see  
  
Hello hello  
Everybody's searching  
How can't you see me  
  
Ahh...
