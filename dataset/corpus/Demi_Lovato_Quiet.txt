I hear what you're not saying  
It's driving me crazy  
It's like we stopped breathing in this room  
  
We're both the last to be leaving  
I know what you're thinking  
I wish you'd make your move  
  
[Chorus]  
It's much too quiet in here  
I wanna disappear  
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear  
It's too quiet in here  
Make it all go away  
Why can't we break this silence finally  
  
It's like you know where I'm going  
You follow me home  
But I never invite you inside  
  
I see what you're not showing  
I got you alone but  
The air is so still it's weird  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop don't stop  
Telling me goodnight  
Just promise you'll kiss me goodbye  
What's taking so long  
  
Don't tell me you're not goin' try  
The tensions building in my mind  
I want to scream and I know why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Make it all go away  
It's too quiet in here
