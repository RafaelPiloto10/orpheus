Springtime of new years, the young thoughts see more dreams  
While you live on the wind, how lovely it all seems  
With moments yet unshared, and wishes incomplete  
The stars above your head, the world beneath your feet  
  
Suddenly your nights, begin to seem so long  
There's no one there to touch, when things start going wrong  
You finally realise, you've never loved at all  
And everywhere you look, you see the white wall  
  
Your father's been too far, your mother's been too near  
And now you're on your own, withdrawing in your fear  
Through long and sleepless nights, the foxes are running free  
You long to be with them, when the scare meets the sea  
  
You climb and then you fall, and then you try again  
You curse yourself aloud, for living so weird  
And took it to the ground, your eyes are filled with tears  
Imprisoned there you lay, in the autumn of your years
