Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
And I can see a fisherman  
His day's catch Iying on the sand  
Underneath the palms that sway  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS:  
Now I'm missing your silver moon  
Black sands and your blue lagoon  
Some day I would like to be  
Back next to your shining sea  
Drinking rum from a conch shell  
Caught up in your magic spell  
Some day I would like to go  
Back down to Mexico  
I remember your fields of cane  
Your warm breezes and jungle rains  
And watching the children play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And out in your market square  
The women sing out to sell their wares  
I've got fresh shrimp today  
From Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
And under the spell of night  
The bay reflecting the harbor light  
You can hear the guitar play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And if you're thinking about romance  
And you're willing to take a chance  
Just pick any small cafe  
In Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay
