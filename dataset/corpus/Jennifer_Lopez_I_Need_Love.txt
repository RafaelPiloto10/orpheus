Oh, oh oh...  
  
This is where my story begins  
Standing here with you  
I'm about to give in  
And I'm gonna give all I can give  
Even though in previous relationships  
I might have been mischievous  
I wasn't already ready  
I admit to this  
But what a good feeling it is  
I've had a lot of crushes  
Close to nothing like this  
Everytime the subject would come  
I made up every excuse that I could think of  
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up  
In a few words this feeling I could sum up  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need  
  
I was hangin' out with my friends  
Seven nights a week  
If there's a party I'm in  
I started getting sick of it  
But when I looked back I didn't know what it meant  
I guess I wasn't interested  
In finding something real  
Though I was looking for it  
You should've been looking for me  
But you opened up my eyes  
And now I can see  
And everytime the subject would come up  
When they say "I love you"  
Then I only dumb up  
A lot of guys  
A girl or shut up  
But you're the only guy that told me your love was endless  
A lot of words with feeling can not sum up  
But first I had to figure out who I was  
To try and understand that there ain't no shortcuts  
Now the only thing that's missing is your love  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me  
  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Oh I need  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin  
  
I need  
  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin  
  
I need  
  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin  
  
I need  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me
