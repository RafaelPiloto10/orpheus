I traced the footsteps through the multi-colored avenues  
That wind their way down to the sea  
I see the birds that fly beneath the darkened sky  
They are the messengers of dreams  
  
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be  
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me  
  
Pages filled with science fiction  
Without fear of contradiction  
Walking through the fields of evergreen I see a turn and walk away  
And from the east there comes a breeze that flows up high into the blue  
  
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be  
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me  
  
The sound of retribution  
In total disillusion, Mandalay  
  
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be  
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me  
  
Amidst the confusion  
The only conclusion  
  
Mandalay of the misty eyes  
Have gazed into the coming door  
The leaves that turn to gold and brown  
I've watched them falling to the ground  
  
Mandalay, now I know what you try to be  
Mandalay, now I wish you were here with me
