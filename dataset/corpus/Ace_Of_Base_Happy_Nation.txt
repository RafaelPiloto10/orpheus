Laudate omnes gentes laudate  
Magnificat in secula  
Et anima mea laudate  
Magnificat in secula  
  
Happy nation living in a happy nation  
Where the people understand  
And dream of the the perfect man  
A situation leading to sweet salvation  
  
For the people for the good  
For mankind brotherhood  
We're traveling in time  
Ideas by man and only that will last  
  
And over time we've learned from the past  
That no man's fit to rule the world alone  
A man will die but not his ideas  
Happy nation  
  
We're traveling in time  
Traveling in time  
Tell them we've gone too far  
Tell them we've gone too far  
  
Happy nation come through  
And I will dance with you  
Happy nation  
Happy nation
