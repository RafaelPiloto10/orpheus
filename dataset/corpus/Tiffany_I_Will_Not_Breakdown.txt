I will not breakdown  
(Tim Feehan, Joe Brooks, Gene Black)  
Time was  
You could start a revolution with this disillusion I feel  
Time was  
You would never make a fool of me  
Can't see nothing but a violent solution  
In this war of confusion in me  
I should run from you but I never would be free  
I will not breakdown (will you break down)  
I will not stand still (are you standing still)  
I will not fall to pieces on the floor  
Just like you want me to  
Time was  
We could have a conversation without confrontation and tears  
Time was  
I wouldn't have to reminisce at all  
This time I'm gonna make a move,  
I'm gonna make an uphill climb  
That's what I've been waiting for  
Bad luck, I guess I'm not a bird in your cage no more  
I will not breakdown (will you break down)  
I will not stadn still (are you standing still)  
I will not fall to pieces on the floor  
Just like you want me to  
There's nothing left for me  
Can't you understand it  
But something left us here just standing in the burning ashes  
There's nothing left for me  
It's not the way I planned it  
But something left us here just buried in our circumstances  
Time was  
You could start a revolution with this disillusion I feel  
Time was  
You would never make a fool of me
