This time he's gonna wear an iron suit  
This time she's gonna fix her heart and make it bullet proof  
He says he's gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit  
She says never never bite more than you can chew  
But this time he's not gonna be another could've been  
This time she's gonna get real, love the skin she's in  
She says a winner never quits, quitters never win  
She said this time that she is built to face anything  
This time he's gonna step for who he is  
This time she's gonna live to work, she's not working to live  
He says just because you say it's true, it don't mean it is  
She says it seems too good to be true, well then it probably is  
This time he's hell bent yeah he's heaven bound  
This time she's gonna pick herself up no more breaking down  
He says he's gonna turn the wheel, turn this shit around  
She says if he's looking for love then she don't want to be found  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's all I've got  
Yeah when you hit the ground  
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound  
  
This time he's gonna make it to the aftermath  
This time she's gonna raise her head choose the righteous path  
He said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh  
She said better to have and not need, than to need and not have  
No matter what the cause it's better to have loved and lost  
Have you ever met a man who never loved at all?  
Yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall  
You have to choose something cuz you can't have it all  
No, he's not gonna be the last to the finish line  
She said even losers get lucky sometimes  
He says it's gonna get better like a fine wine  
She says it's harder to smell the roses when the sun don't shine  
This time he's gonna find another way  
This time she's gonna take you to the good ol'days with no... gracing  
Only warm embraces with the two little sweet angels with dirty faces  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's all I've got  
Yeah when you hit the ground  
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound  
  
Every break, every burn, every toss, every turn, every sin,  
Anything you've learned it's all programmed, all programmed  
Every break, every burn, every toss, every turn, every sin,  
Everything we've learned it's all programmed, all programmed  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's all I've got  
Yeah when you hit the ground
