Maybe far away, or maybe real near by.  
He may be pouring her coffee,  
She may be Straightening his tie.  
Maybe in a house all hidden by a hill,  
She's sitting playing Piano,  
He's sitting paying a bill.  
  
Betcha they're young.  
Betcha they're smart,  
Bet they collect things like ashtrays and art.  
Betcha there good.  
Why shouldn't they be?  
Their one mistake was giving up me.  
  
So maybe now it's time,  
And maybe when I wake,  
They'll be there calling me baby,  
Maybe.
