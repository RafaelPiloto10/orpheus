[Verse:]  
You're a paper doll  
I fold you how I want  
You're not my noose  
I tied this knot  
If this won't be  
Our fingers locked together  
This is total war  
Method not objective  
  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue em back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together!  
Back together!  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
Scars on my fingers, bruises on neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
warship my wreck!  
warship my wreck!  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Cut the hands off  
Then kamikaze into your soul  
Kamikaze into your soul...  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Warship my Wreck!  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
Warship my wreck!  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
warship my wreck!  
  
Scars on my fingers, bruises my neck  
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck  
  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue em back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together  
Cannot say, I'm breaking the rules  
If I can glue them back together!
