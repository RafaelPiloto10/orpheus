I'm looking for a Miracle Man that tells me no lies  
I'm looking for a Miracle Man who's not in disguise.  
  
I don't know where he'll come from and I don't know where he's been,  
But it's not our Jimmy Sinner, because he's so obscene.  
  
Miracle Man got busted  
Miracle Man got busted  
  
Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'.  
Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.  
  
He don't know where he's goin', but we know just where he's been  
T'was was our little Jimmy Sinner, our eyes are on the screen.  
  
Miracle Man got busted, Miracle Man got busted,  
Miracle Man got busted, Miracle Man.  
  
A Devil wears a crucifix, brimstone and fire.  
He needs another carnal fix, to take him higher and higher.  
  
  
Now Jimmy he got busted, with his pants down.  
Repent ye wretched sinners, self righteous clown.  
  
Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle  
Man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle man got  
Busted, miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted.
