Yourself  
Are you older than your enemy self  
You're not big  
I'm not strong enough to carry you here  
You're there  
  
You're well  
I believe you are a victum of this  
You're so bad  
I cannot express the emotion I had  
You're there  
  
No  
Where you stop  
You beg your time  
You know it's why I'm not so right  
When you talk  
You know just why I'm out  
You're heavier than  
Yourself  
  
You  
You're there  
You're a victum you are suffering  
You're so sad  
You cannot explain that time that you laughed  
You're there  
  
No  
Where you stop  
You be you lie  
You talk about when I come back  
When you talk  
You know you lie about  
You're right below  
You're there  
  
You build a sound  
Looking back  
Burning, burning  
While you stare  
When you do  
I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know
