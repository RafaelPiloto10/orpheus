[Chorus]  
I want to be the minority  
I don't need your authority  
Down with the moral majority  
Cause I want to be the minority  
  
I pledge allegiance to the underworld  
One nation under dog  
There of which I stand alone  
A face in the crowd  
Unsung, against the mold  
Without a doubt,  
Singled out  
The only way I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stepped out of the line  
Like a sheep runs from the herd  
Marching out of time  
To my own beat now  
The only way I know  
One light, one mind  
Flashing in the dark  
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts  
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me  
A free for all  
Fuck 'em all  
"You're on your own side"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One light, one mind  
Flashing in the dark  
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts  
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me  
A free for all  
Fuck 'em all  
"You're on your own side"  
  
[Chorus]
