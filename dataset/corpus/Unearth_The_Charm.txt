The weight of the charm  
Lights out for hands stretched out to lead  
The forsaken walk of allegiance  
In trust we deceive  
Walk on-never to turn back  
A look inside turned to stone  
My soul is free with blood on my hands  
My soul is free  
Lights out  
I stand aside  
Struggle in my mind  
I look inside to see the crowd infringed upon  
Lights out  
The death of the charm  
Lights out-the hands will recede  
The forgotten chance of disloyalty  
In trust we are deceived  
Send off-it's out of your hands  
Walk on-it's only your life
