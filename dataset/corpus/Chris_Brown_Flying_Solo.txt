(Feat. Dr. Dre)  
  
Departure time 7: 30  
I'm packed and ready to go  
First class ticket outta here  
I think it's time,  
To put it back in gear,  
No more standing by,  
I'm tryin to stay clear  
  
Turbulence got me nervous,  
I should have never flown  
Scared when you  
Fly alone again  
You know the atmosphere  
Wasn't perfect  
I'm thinkin to myself  
Was it worth it  
  
Layover's almost over  
I can see clearly,  
No more stormy weather  
Exit row,  
Don't pull on  
The lever, lever  
This gon be  
My final destination  
No more sittin round  
Havin my time wasted  
  
You say it's now or never  
I pick never  
We can be together,  
So calm down  
No more red eye late nights  
I'm one way,  
No more connected flights  
  
When we stared out knew  
This relationship  
Was unhealthy  
You broke the code,  
Never thought  
That you would stoop so low  
You got me flyin solo  
Now you cryin talkin bout you  
Can't live without me yeah  
  
You've got me flying solo  
Solo solo  
  
Touchin' down 11: 30  
I'm rushing  
Through the doors  
I'm in a good place now  
Can't find my baggage  
And I don't even want it back  
And I don't want  
To have you no more  
  
I don't need to carry on  
It's gonna weight me down  
He didn't think  
That I would find out  
Whether or not  
Who is wrong or right  
I can't talk now,  
I gotta catch another flight  
  
Layover's almost over,  
I can see clearly,  
No more stormy weather  
Exit row, don't pull  
On the lever, lever  
This gon be  
My final destination  
  
No more sittin round  
Havin my time wasted.  
  
You say it's now or never  
I pick never  
We can be together, s  
O calm down  
No more red eye late nights  
I'm one way,  
No more connected flights  
  
When we stared out knew  
This relationship  
Was unhealthy  
You broke the code,  
Never thought  
That you would stoop so low  
You got me flyin solo  
Now you cryin talkin bout you  
Can't live without me yeah  
  
You've got me flying solo  
Solo solo  
  
Four hours scared to fly  
Without you here  
Now you can't get  
Under my skin  
Like you did before  
Why  
I was reluctant  
To walk out on us  
So now I'm taking  
Back my life  
Goodbye
