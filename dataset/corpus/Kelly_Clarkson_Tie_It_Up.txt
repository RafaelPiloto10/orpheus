I was sittin' with my friend when I saw you walkin' in and my heart started
skippin' a beat  
I was tryna play it cool but I knew it was true that nobody would ever compete  
Well first comes love and then comes  
First date, first kiss, we were checkin' off the list, then you were gettin'
down on one knee  
And you didn't have to guess, it was always a yes, now there's two less fish
in the sea  
  
Let's set the date!  
Let's haul the band!  
Let's cut the cake!  
Tie up the cans!  
I love the ring of your name, your the ying to my yang,  
Oh baby let's give it a shot!  
(Woo!)  
Every wall needs a frame, every ball needs a chain, yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout
tiein' a knot!  
Tie it up!  
  
Somethin' old, somethin' new, somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue,  
And the chairs lined up in the yard.  
The "I do"s and the kisses from a miss to a misses  
Can't wait for forever to stop  
  
Let's set set the date!  
Let's haul the bands!  
Let's cut the cake!  
Tie up the cans!  
I love the ring of your name, your the ying to my yang,  
Oh baby let's give it a shot!  
(Woo!)  
Every wall needs a frame, every ball needs a chain, yeah I'm talkin' bout
tiein' a knot!  
Tie it up!  
  
Tie it up! (Tie it up!)  
Invite the town! (Invite the town!)  
Raise your glass and lock it down!  
Tie it up! (Tie it up!)  
Forever bound! (Forever bound!)  
'Cause I think this will be tonight, yeah!  
  
Well mama's kickin' off her shoes and daddy's spinnin' from the booze, and the
last song is finally sung  
We can run to the moon, can't stop a hunny moon  
Don't it sound like a lot of fun?  
  
Let's set the date!  
Let's haul the band!  
Let's cut the cake!  
Tie up the cans!  
I love the ring of your name, you're the ying to my yang,  
Oh baby let's give it a shot  
Oh!  
Every wall needs a frame, every ball needs a chain, I'm talkin' bout tiein' a
knot  
Tie it up!  
  
Woo!  
Tell you what  
Tie it up!
