Sweet dreams from Texaco, and I know your mind is on  
It's way to Mexico, sweet Jesus is on his way to take  
You on his way down  
You get your fill of what you like and you fill your head  
With what you might want yourself to be when you're ready  
But if you leave  
It's gonna get a little easier to break down  
And if you leave  
It's gonna get a little bit easier for you to break down  
My new dress is your new way out, my new way is your new  
Dress, and you look fine  
But your new belief is my regret and my regret  
Leaves you to believe that we have found the line  
And if you leave  
Take me along, anywhere is ok  
And if you leave  
Take me along, anywhere is ok  
Think back and you can feel me movin' through you  
It's easy when you try  
Think back and you can feel me  
Well you won't feel me  
You can't feel me if you leave  
And if you leave  
You won't feel me
