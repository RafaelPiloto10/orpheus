You ain't gonna bother me no more  
No how  
Love just goes so far  
No more  
Woke up this morning and found  
I didn't care for you no more  
No how  
  
Never felt so good before  
You're down to my size  
It's over and done  
So honey, step down from your throne  
That look in your eyes  
Don't bother me none  
Can take or leave you alone  
From my window  
Sky's ain't gray no more  
Not now  
  
Here's the day  
That I've been waiting for  
Got only one heart  
One heart with no spares  
Must save it for loving  
Somebody who cares  
So you ain't gonna bother me  
No more, no more
