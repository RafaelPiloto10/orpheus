It's only everytime I'm looking to you straight in the eyes  
Baby, you know the eye is on you  
Everytime I'm looking to you straight in the eye  
Baby, baby,baby, I get the thrills  
  
Why won't you leave away from my side before you break my heart  
Baby, won't you lose, so please  
Leave away from my side before you break my heart  
'cause baby, baby,baby, I get the thrills  
  
It's only...(etc.)
