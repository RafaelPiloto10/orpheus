Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
Dashing thro' the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh.  
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.  
Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright,  
what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.  
  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright  
Was seated at my side  
The horse was lean and lank  
Misfortune seemed his lot  
he got into and drifted back, and we we've got upset  
  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
