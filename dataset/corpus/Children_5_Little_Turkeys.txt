Five little turkeys standing in a row. (Hold up 5 fingers)  
First little turkey said, I don't want to grow. (Hold up 1 finger)  
Second little turkey said, Why do you say that? (Hold up 2 fingers)  
Third little turkey said, I want to get fat. (Hold up 3 fingers)  
Fourth little turkey said, Thanksgiving is near. (Hold up 4 fingers)  
Fifth little turkey said, Yes, that's what I hear. (Hold up 5 fingers)  
Then the five little turkeys that were standing in a row,  
All said together, Come on, let's go! (Move fingers like they're running away)
