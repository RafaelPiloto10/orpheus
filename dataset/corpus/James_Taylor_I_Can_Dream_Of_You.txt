I wake up in the morning  
I walk out on the street  
And my face lights up with all the smiles  
Of all the friends I meet  
And my life's almost complete  
Cause I can dream of you  
  
And I don't feel no heartache  
And I don't feel no pain  
And I don't feel all those angry souls  
That are standing in the rain  
And my life's peaceful once again  
Cause I can dream of you  
  
Then I wake myself up  
I take a look around  
And there's not much I can say  
No one's here to say it to, why anyway  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
  
My day and night  
They're just about the same  
I think I'll just call them gray  
But I think of you  
And the sun breaks through  
And I'm glad to live my life this way  
  
You're so understanding  
So gentle and serene  
And I swear you've got the sweetest eyes  
That I've ever seen  
And I pray that I may never lose  
A single dream of you  
  
Lord knows that I'll be in for hard times  
Pain will know my soul  
And the wind is blowing from the North  
And it comes down so cold  
I know never will I lose all hope  
Cause I can dream of you  
  
I know never will I lose all hope  
Cause I can dream of you
