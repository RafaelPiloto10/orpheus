I hate racist blokes, telling tasteless jokes  
And explaining where people belong  
I hate ignorant folks, who pay money to see gigs  
And talk through every fucking song  
I hate people in night clubs, snorting coke  
And explaining where your going wrong  
Well if you agree, then come hating with me  
And feel free to sing along  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Wonderful, love it  
  
Well I hate pointless status updates on Facebook  
Fyi we were never "m8"s  
We pretend to be friends on the internet  
When in real life, we have nothing to say  
To each other, oh brother I have love for my mother  
For good times, for music and my mates  
Yeah I laugh, and live and I have love to give  
But sometimes all you can do is hate  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
Well I hate them fussy eaters, you cook them fajitas  
They only eat pizza and chips  
I hate stepping outside, for a smoke and some guy  
Coughs, like your lungs are his  
And I hate queuing up, for festival toilets  
Especially when you need to shit  
And I hate the X-Factor, for murdering music  
You bunch of money grubbing pricks  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
And I hate them magazines, aimed at insecure teens  
That make ten year old's race to grow up  
Hey kids, let's all be anorexic or better  
Eat chocolate until you throw up  
Keep your Hollywood stars, and their stupid cars  
And the Bo-tox, that makes them look fucked  
Just grow old with grace, have you seen Cher's face  
It looks like it's been hit by a truck  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
One more time, loud as you can  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
