[Verse 1]  
Concrete dream - hey  
I'm gonna make a scene: radio  
Caught burning gasoline, sleeping in reverse  
And everybody's bouncing off the walls  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bombs away - hey  
It's just another day  
And I don't tread  
The secret of the day  
I wouldn't sweat it  
And everybody's bouncing off the walls  
Im bouncing off the walls!  
Alright!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Concrete kiss - hey  
Come on and do the twist: radio  
My little exorcist, we're all getting pissed  
And everybody's bouncing off the walls  
  
[Chorus 1 - 2x]  
'cause it's all that I want  
And I want to be free  
I got Satan riding next to me  
'cause we're all bloody freaks  
And we'll give you the creeps  
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
