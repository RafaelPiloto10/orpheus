Someday, when I'm awfully low  
When the world is cold  
I will feel a glow, just thinking of you  
And the way you look tonight  
  
Yes, you're lovely  
With your smile so warm, and your cheeks so soft  
There is nothing for me but to love you  
And the way you look tonight  
  
With each word, your tenderness grows  
Tearing my fears apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose  
It touches my foolish heart  
  
Lovely, never ever change,  
Keep that breathless charm  
Won't you please arrange it?  
'Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
With each word your tenderness grows  
Tearing my fears apart  
And your laugh, well it wrinkles your nose  
It touches my foolish heart  
  
Lovely, never ever change.  
Keep that breathless charm.  
Won't you please arrange it?  
Because I love you  
Just the way you look tonight
