You ain't nothing but a hound dog, crying all the time  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, crying all the time  
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine  
  
They said you were high class, honey that was just a lie  
Called you all high class, that was just a lie  
You ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine
