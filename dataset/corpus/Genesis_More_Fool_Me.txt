Here am I  
Who while away the mornings  
Since you've gone  
Too long have I lay alone  
Not knowing which way to turn.  
  
And there you are  
Quite sure that you were right  
Knowing full well  
That I'd be the first one  
To go down.  
  
And you'd be the one who was laughing  
Except when things weren't going your way  
And then the lady would say that she'd had enough  
Wandering around on her own.  
  
The day you left  
Well I think you knew you'd not be back  
Well at least it would seem that way  
Because you never said goodbye.  
But when it comes round to you and me  
I'm sure it will work out alright.  
  
And you'd be the one who was laughing  
And giving me something I don't need  
And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm  
Oh! more fool me.  
  
Ah, but when it comes  
Round to you and me  
I ask myself  
Do I really believe  
In your love.  
  
Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright.
