I remember so well  
The day that you came  
Into my life  
You asked for my name  
You have the most beautiful smile  
  
My life started to change  
I wake up each day feeling all right  
With you right by my side  
Makes me feel things  
Will work out just fine  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That there was an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life  
I never forget how you brought the sun to shine in my life  
And took all the worries and fears that I had  
I guess what I'm really trying to say  
It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  
No words can express how much I love you
