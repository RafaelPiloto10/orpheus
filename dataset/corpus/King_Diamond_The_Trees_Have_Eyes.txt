I'd been riding hard most of the night, wooded ravines on a mountain side  
My horse was getting tired, and so was I  
Up there the moon was full, down here darkness ruled  
The trees were so much higher than they were meant to  
  
In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"  
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes  
I used to know this road so well, many a time i was here before  
  
But now it seemed so different, the road was no more  
I was lost, I stopped and looked around  
I had this eerie feeling, that I was being watched  
In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"  
  
I knew I was not alone, and it wasn't not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes  
Watching me  
The trees have eyes, watching me  
  
Then the sound I didn't want to hear, howling at the moon  
Eyes I didn't want to see, I should have turned around  
So much louder, the howling was chilling my bones  
One wolf grown to a dozen, and here I was alone  
  
Yellow eyes, they were everywhere, yellow eyes, as I prepared to die  
Suddenly there she was, in a halo of light  
Suddenly there she was, silvery black and white  
The bluest magical eyes staring right into mine  
  
Never ever had I seen in a wolf, such a beautiful beast  
In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"  
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes
