I'm sending this letter  
I'll mail it today  
There's so many things I've been wanting to say  
Your mom sent some pictures  
And my how you've grown  
Rock n roll fathers are never at home  
I'm writing this letter  
  
I made you a song  
I promised your mom that I'd write while I'm gone  
You say daddy come home  
Well you'll just have to wait  
  
I hope when I get there that it won't be too late  
Skylar I just missed your first step today  
I have no excuses and nothing to say  
I live on a bus with a rock n roll band  
I hope when your older that you'll understand  
  
I'm coming home soon  
This tour's almost through  
I promise I'll try to spend more time with you  
You say daddy come home  
You'll just have to wait  
  
I hope when I get there that it won't be too late  
Now Madison Blue you know I love you too  
Not a single day passes that I don't think of you  
I'm running on empty and a mountain so high  
I can pull out your pictures and look in your eyes  
I long for the day when your old man comes home  
It kills me to hear you say daddy don't go  
  
You say daddy come home  
You'll just have to wait  
I hope when I get there that it won't be too late  
Daddy's at work now he's trying to pay bills  
Ego's and assholes are part of my deal  
I make some money and I have some fun  
The tax man he come'th and I'm back to square one  
  
Don't worry bout your daddy  
You girls be good  
Give a kiss to your mother  
I sure wish I could  
This life has it's moments  
I'm not always sad  
Take care and I love you  
Your rock n roll dad
