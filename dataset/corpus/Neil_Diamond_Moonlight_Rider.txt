Hey, just for one last time  
I'll sing my song just like I did before  
When we were all young  
Can you still recall how it was sung?  
  
The songs are only rhymes  
Life don't turn out  
The way we thought it would  
When we were all young  
Used to love to hear them love songs sung  
  
I was the moonlight rider  
I'd ride out on a sea of dreams  
Far away, long ago, so it seems  
Won't you take  
That moonlight ride with me?  
  
Well, just for one last time  
I'll sing my song just like I did before  
Maybe you'll sing along  
Do you still recall that moonlight song?  
  
I am the moonlight rider  
I'm riding on a sea of dreams  
Far away, long ago, so it seems  
Won't you take  
That moonlight ride with me?
