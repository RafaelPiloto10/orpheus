In the city there's a thousand things I want to say to you  
But whenever I approach you, you make me look a fool  
I wanna say, I wanna tell you  
About the young ideas  
But you turn them into fears  
In the city there's a thousand faces all shining bright  
And those golden faces are under twenty five  
They wanna say, they gonna tell ya  
About the young idea  
You better listen now you've said your bit-a  
  
And I know what you're thinking  
  
You still think I am crap  
But you'd better listen man  
Because the kids know where it's at  
  
In the city there's a thousand men in uniforms  
And I've heard they now have the right to kill a man  
We wanna say, we gonna tell ya  
About the young idea  
And if it don't work, at least we said we've tried  
  
In the city, in the city  
In the city there's a thousand things  
I want to say to you
