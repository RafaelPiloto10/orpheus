How many people stand in a line?  
How many people never get a chance to shine?  
If you can tell me I'll gladly listen  
How many people have died?  
  
One too many right now for me  
I want to be happy, I want to be free,  
One too many tight now for me  
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully.  
  
How many people, go for a ride  
How many people, never make it through to the other side?  
If you can tell me, I'll gladly listen,  
How many people have cried?  
  
One too many right now for me  
I want to be happy,  
I want to be free,  
One too many tight now for me  
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully.  
  
How many people, will I take? how many people  
For goodness sake?  
How many people?  
How many people?  
One too many
