How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man  
How many seas must the white dove sail  
Before she can sleep in the sand  
  
[Chorus]  
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind  
The answer is blowing in the wind  
  
Yes, and how many times must a man look up  
Before he can see the sky  
Yes, and how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it is washed to the sea  
And how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free  
  
[Chorus]
