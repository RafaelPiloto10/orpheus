I've no consideration,  
Zero mutual respect  
For billions who suffer from  
Rational thought neglect  
I don't wanna waste a sentence,  
I don't want a convert-sation  
That's gonna end in disdain,  
Disbelief and aggravation  
  
And I find it's getting harder to hang out  
With grown adults who actually believe  
In Santa Claus and Noah's Ark  
And that their god is the best  
My distaste has turned into detest  
  
Who would read a 2000  
Year old medical journal  
Techniques for bloodletting,  
Advice on Trichinosis  
Would you navigate the globe  
With a map of a flat earth  
Without DNA testing,  
Would you believe virgin birth  
  
And I find it's getting painful to put up  
With grown adults who actually believe  
In Unicorns and Creation,  
And God always takes their side  
That's when my innocent jabbing turns snide  
  
Thank God for the Grammy,  
Thank God for the touchdown  
Thank God for blowing up  
The enemy's sacred ground  
  
So how am I supposed to take  
Anything you say seriously?  
When you've swapped free will for faith,  
How and pre-destiny  
  
And it's getting agonizing to hang out  
With grown adults who actually believe  
Mythology and history  
Trump physics and science  
My aversion has turned to abhorrence
