I have been with the best that the bastards could muster  
From danny the dildo to sidney the snake  
And i feel like a working girl pausing to wonder  
Just how much screwin' the spirit can take  
  
Chorus:  
I said, "willie old buddy, please tell me again  
The reason to keep goin' on."  
He said, "there's no harder words to say over a friend  
Than they done you so righteously wrong  
They stopped you from singing your song"  
  
He was our hero, boys, he took the bullet  
But he went down swingin' his fist from the floor  
You can ask any working girl south of the border  
Sam peckinpah era un hombre for sure  
  
Chorus:  
Willie old buddy please tell me again  
The reason to keep goin' on  
He said, "there's no harder words to say over a friend  
Than they done you so righteously wrong  
They stopped you from singin' your song."  
  
But not me.
