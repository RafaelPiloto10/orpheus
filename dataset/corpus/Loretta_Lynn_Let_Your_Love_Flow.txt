There's a reason for the sunshine sky there's a reason why I'm feeling so high  
Must be the season when that love light shines all around us  
So let that feeling grab you deep inside and send you reeling  
Where your love can't hide and then go stealing  
  
Through the moonless nights with your lover  
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream  
Let your love grow with the smallest of dreams  
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean it's the season  
  
Yeah let your love fly like a bird on the wing  
And let your love bind you to all living things  
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean that's the reason  
  
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights and there's a reason for the candle
lights  
Must be the season when those love rites shine all around us  
So let the wonder take you into space and lay you under its loving embrace  
Let feel the thunder as it warms your face you can't hold back  
  
Just let your love flow...  
Just let your love flow...
