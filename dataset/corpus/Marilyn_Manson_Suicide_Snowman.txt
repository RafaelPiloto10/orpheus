If I had time to kill the world I'd try  
Ohh, no, but I'm busy, killing me  
I don't have time to build a suicide  
Because the snowman melts in spring  
The striped girls will not be coming back  
In the summer they run from me, May  
I don't have time to even say goodbye  
We are dying as winter leaves spring  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am free, yeah  
Corn cob pipe and a button nose, yeah  
Puddled in the grass two lump of coal  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am  
If I had time to kill the world I'd try  
But I'm busy killing what's in me  
I don't have time to even say goodbye  
We are dying as winter leaves spring  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am free, yeah  
Corn cob pipe and a button nose, yeah  
Spring, spring, spring, spring  
Spring, spring, spring, spring
