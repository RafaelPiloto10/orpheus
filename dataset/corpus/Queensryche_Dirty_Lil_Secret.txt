Times have changed  
for the better  
You like to say  
Nice house in the country  
Now you're on your way  
You took advantage of our possibilities  
Got your sights set far  
No time for sympathy  
  
Keeping up with the Jones's  
Smiling at the neighbors  
Don't let them see your  
  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
Keep your hands over your eyes and  
Maybe it will go away  
Dirty, Dirty little secret

When you face the mirror  
Consider this  
Why judge another when you've got  
Your own shit to fix

Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
I'll be leaving the status quo behind

The dynamic of America is progress for all  
Well, can't hold us back we're right on the track  
No wall is too tall  
By the will of the people  
We'll take a road to higher ground  
And don't worry about that  
  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
Everybody's got one  
So many you can pass them around  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
I'll be leaving the status quo behind
