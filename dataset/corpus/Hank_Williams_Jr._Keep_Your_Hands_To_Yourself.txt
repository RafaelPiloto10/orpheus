I got a little change in my pocket going jingle lingle ling  
Want to call you on the telephone baby I give you a ring  
But each time we talk I get the same old thing  
Always no huggin no kissin until I get a wedding ring  
My honey my baby don't put my love upon no shelf  
She said don't give no lines and keep your hands to yourself  
  
Cruel baby baby baby why you want to treat me this way  
You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way  
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow  
And she said no huggin no kissin until I get a wedding vow  
My honey my baby don't put my love upon no shelf  
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself  
  
You see I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in  
That's when she started talkin' true love started talkin' about sin  
I said honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life  
She said no huggin no kissin until you make me your wife  
My honey my baby don't put my love on no shelf  
She don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself.
