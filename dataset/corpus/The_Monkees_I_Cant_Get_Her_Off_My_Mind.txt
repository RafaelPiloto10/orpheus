I've been standing on the corner all day  
Tryin' to think of little things to say  
'Cause she walks by ev'ry day about this time  
And I don't think, I'll ever get her off of my mind.  
  
Well I only met her 'bout a week ago  
But the way she smiles let me know  
That she could see that maybe we were two of a kind.  
And I don't think I'll ever get her off of my mind.  
  
Oh she's so pretty I couldn't believe  
She'd ever look my way  
But the way I'm feeling  
I'm gonna be stealing  
That little girl's heart today.  
  
Well, I'm so happy I could almost fly  
And I guess you know the reason why,  
I'm walkin' down the street with her little hand in mine.  
And I don't think I'll ever get her off of my mind.
