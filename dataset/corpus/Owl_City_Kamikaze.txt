The princess in her flowerbed,  
Pulled the jungle underground,  
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red,  
And explosions never make a sound.  
Oh comet come down  
Kamikaze over me,  
And come alive  
My midnight melody  
Oh comet come down  
  
My captain on the snowy horse,  
He's coming back to take me home,  
(He's coming back to take me home!)  
He'll find me fighting back the terrible force,  
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone.  
Oh comet come down!  
Kamikaze over me,  
  
And come alive!  
My midnight melody!  
Oh comet come down!  
Kamikaze over me,  
And come alive!  
My midnight melody!  
Oh comet come down!  
Oh comet come down!  
  
(Break down the open doors)  
Maybe I'll write,  
(And fight back the undertones)  
To save my life,  
(Break in, the ember glows)  
Maybe I'll fly,  
(And go where you want to go)  
With the eagle eye!  
  
(Break down the open doors)  
Maybe I'll write,  
(And fight back the undertones)  
To save my life,  
(Break in, the ember glows)  
Maybe I'll fly,  
(And go where you want to go)  
With the eagle eye!  
(Eagle eye)
