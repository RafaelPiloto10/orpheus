Seek him here, seek him on the highway  
Never knowing when he'll appear  
All await, engine's ticking over  
Hear the roar as they sense the fear  
  
Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light!  
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes!  
  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
  
Black as night, faster than a shadow  
Crimson flare from a raging sun  
An exhibition, of sheer precision  
Yet no one knows from where he comes  
  
Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown  
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground  
  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
  
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster  
But they didn't last and they died as they tried  
  
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster  
But they didn't last and they died as they tried  
  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather  
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
