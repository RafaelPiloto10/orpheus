This day is the day that we rise or we fall  
This night is night that we win or lose all  
This time is the time that we wait for awhile  
This year is the year that we wait with a smile  
If you call, we will follow  
If you show us we can tow the line  
And now that you're here you can show me the way  
And now that you're here we can try make it pay  
And while you were gone it was hard, it was cold  
While you were gone we were time, we were old  
If you call we will follow  
If you show us we can tow the line  
If you call we will follow  
If you show us we can tow the line
