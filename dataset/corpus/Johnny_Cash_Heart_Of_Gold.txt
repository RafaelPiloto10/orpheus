I want to live,  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.  
It's these expressions I never give  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
  
I've been to Hollywood  
I've been to redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
  
You keep me searching for a heart of gold  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.  
And I'm getting old.
