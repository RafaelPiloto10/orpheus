She was standing at the load-in  
When the trucks rolled up  
She was sniffin' all around  
Like a half-grown female pup  
She wasn't hard to talk to  
Looked like she had nowhere to go  
So I gave her a pass  
So she could get in and see the show  
Well, I sat her down right next to me  
And I got her a beer  
While I mixed that sound on the stage  
So the band could hear  
The more I watched her watch them play  
The less I thought of to say  
And when they walked off stage  
You know, the drummer swept that girl away  
  
But Rosie, you're all right  
(You wear my ring)  
When you hold me tight  
(Rosie, that's my thing)  
When you turn out the light  
(I got to hand it to me)  
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie  
  
Well I guess I might have known from the start  
She'd come for a star  
Well I told my imagination not to run too far  
Of all the times that I've been burned  
By now you think I'd've learned  
That it's who you look like,  
Not who you are  
(You all keep that in mind)  
  
Rosie, you're all right  
(You wear my ring)  
When you hold me tight  
(Rosie, that's my thing)  
When you turn out the light  
(I got to hand it to me)  
It looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie  
It looks like it's me and you again tonight,  
It looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie  
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie, Rosie
