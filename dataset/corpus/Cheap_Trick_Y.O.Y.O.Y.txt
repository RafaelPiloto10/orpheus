Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I  
Be in love forever  
Oh why can't I  
Be in love for ever  
And ever and ever  
I wonder  
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I  
Be in love forever  
  
First thing you know  
Is what you're looking for  
Next thing you know is where you find it  
You can't explain the pain  
Of feelin' so alone  
So I won't even try to tell you, no  
  
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I  
Be in love forever  
Oh why can't I  
Be in love for ever  
And ever and ever  
I wonder  
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I  
Be in love forever  
  
Some days it hurts so bad  
Can't take it anymore  
Those days and nights  
They last forever  
Some ways of feelin' good don't feel good anymore  
They only mask your real feelings  
Why, oh why, why, oh why  
  
Halfway up, halfway down  
Won't you turn my luck around  
Halfway here, halfway there  
Say the words and I'll be there  
  
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I  
Be in love forever  
Oh why can't I  
Be in love for ever  
And ever and ever  
I wonder  
Why, oh why, why, oh why can't I  
Be in love forever  
  
Be in love forever  
Be in love forever  
Be in love forever
