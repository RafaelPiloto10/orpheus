I was born in Michigan,  
And I wish and wish again  
That I was back in the town where I was born.  
There's a farm in Michigan,  
And I'd like to fish again,  
In the river that flows beside the field of waving corn.  
A lonesome soul am I... Here's the reason why.  
I want to go back, I want to go back, .  
I want to go back to the farm..  
Far away from harm, with a milk pail on my arm. .  
I miss the rooster, the one that use-ter wake me up at 4am..  
I think your great big cities very pretty... Nevertheless  
I want to be there, .  
I want to see there a certain soemone full of charm. .  
That's why I wish again that I was in Michigan, down on the farm.  
I want to go back, I want to go back,  
I want to go back to that old farm.  
Far away from harm, with a milk pail on my arm.  
I miss the rooster, the rooster that use-ter wake me up at 4am.  
I think your great big cities very pretty... Nevertheless  
I want to be there,  
I want to see there a certain someone full of charm.  
That's why I wish again,  
That I was in Michigan, down on the farm.
