California, California  
Much has been told me about your beautiful sunshine  
Mountains and snow tops, valleys and rich crops  
California, home so far from mine  
  
San Francisco, Sacramento  
Will I ever go to Los Angeles or San Diego ?  
To Reading or Fresno  
Needles or Borstow, California I have so far to go  
  
Someday I will be in California  
And go to places movie stars have been  
Hollywood and trolley cars and oranges  
And see the palm trees bending in the wind  
  
California, California  
Soon I'll be with you watching your sunset in the evening  
Movies and show plays, beaches and free ways  
California, from my home I'll be leaving  
  
California, California
