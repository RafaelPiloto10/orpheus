I know that I  
I can't believe  
Just what the path has brought me  
To the man I want to be  
And I know that we  
Have had some times  
That we can't forget the struggle  
Cause we have so far to go  
  
I know we have changed  
But change can be so good  
So lets not forget why it's understood  
That  
  
[Chorus]  
Time (time)  
Look where we are and what we've been through  
Time (time)  
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)  
Time  
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday  
Baby time is what is, come what may  
  
I remember when  
Mom used to say  
That things are getting better  
And you'll soon be on your way  
Remember those days  
That we would sing at the drop of a dime  
Way back when nothing else mattered  
  
I know we have changed  
But change can be so good  
So lets not forget why it's understood  
That  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So here we are (here we are)  
And we'll always stick together  
And through it all you know we owe it all  
To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Time goes on and on everyday  
Time is what it is  
Come what may  
Come what may
