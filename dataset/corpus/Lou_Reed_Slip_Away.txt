Friends have said to lock the door  
And have an open house no more  
The said the factory must change  
And slowly slip away  
  
But if I have to live in fear  
Where will I get my ideas  
With all those crazy people gone  
Will I slowly slip away  
  
Still there's no more billy name  
Ondine is not the same  
Wonton and the turtle gone  
Slowly slip away  
Slowly slip away  
  
If I close the factory door  
And don't see those people anymore  
If I give in to infamy  
I'll slowly slip away  
  
I know it seems that friends are right  
Hello daylight, goodbye night  
But starlight is so quiet here  
Think i'll slowly slip away  
  
What can I do by myself  
It's good to here from someone else  
It's good to hear a crazy voice  
Will not slip away  
Will not slip away  
  
If I have to live in fear  
My ideas will slowly slip away  
  
If I have to live in fear  
I'm afraid my life will slip away  
  
If you can't see me past my door  
Why your thoughts could slowly slip away  
  
If I have to lock the door  
Another life exists no more slip away  
  
Friends have said to lock the door  
Watch out for who comes through the door  
The said the factory must change  
  
But I don't
