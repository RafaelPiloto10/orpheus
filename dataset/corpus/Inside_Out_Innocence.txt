Innocence, Simplicity of youth.  
Not a care in the world,  
But more charity than you could ever ask for.  
I wanna run and I wanna shout and I wanna play your game.  
I wanna know what you're about will you please stay with me.  
(Chorus)  
'Cause I feel like a child again,  
And you are my best friend.  
And I know that we can live forever.  
Stay with me, there's no end.  
Immortality, drink from the fountain of youth.  
Take an extra sip for me, I'm gonna need it.  
I'll take another dip with you.  
'Cause I'm dreaming dreams and I'm seeing things I ain't ever seen before.  
I'd scorn to change my place with kings ... I couldn't ask for more.  
(Chorus)  
(Bridge)  
I'm dreaming dreams and I'm seeing things I ain't ever seen before.  
I'd scorn to change my place with kings ... I couldn't ask for more.  
Eternity feels like forever to me.  
But if we're gonna live forever, I'll live for you, you live for me.  
We've had our ups, we've had our downs, and we've seen brighter days.  
If this is love, let's work it out. Will you please stay with me.  
(Chorus Twice)
