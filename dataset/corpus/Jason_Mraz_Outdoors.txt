All day I've been inside  
And I've got the feeling  
I'm trapped between the walls  
And underneath the ceiling  
I feel a bit off track  
And now I'm trying to get back  
  
Back in the cool cool air  
Where the sun in shining  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
It's all in the timing  
It's finally again my turn  
It's time to return  
  
Cause I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
I cannot wait to go outdoors  
Mmmhmmhmmhmm  
Hey hey hey (Elmo)  
  
Well open up your door  
And be like me  
Open up your door  
And then breathe free  
Look at all the beauty you'll feel  
Love love love love  
  
Listen to the music of the wind  
And the birdies sing  
We're just one big family  
And all of nature deserves to be  
Loved loved loved loved loved  
  
So I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
I'm sure  
There's no need to run and hide  
Let's go explore  
It feels so great  
  
Let's go outdoors  
  
Do do do do do do do do  
Everyone come on  
Come on out here  
Where the air is fresh and clear  
  
So I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
Let's go outdoors  
  
Jason:  
Well open up your door  
And be like me  
Open up your door  
And then breathe free  
Look at all the beauty  
And you'll find the earth  
And the sky is yours  
So please don't  
There's no need  
There's no need to hide inside  
Let's go explore  
This'll this'll  
It feels so great  
Let's go outdoors  
  
Everybody else(at same time):  
I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
I'm sure  
There's no need to run and hide  
Let's go explore  
It feels so great  
Let's go outdoors
