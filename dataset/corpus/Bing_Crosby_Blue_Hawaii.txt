Night and you and Blue Hawaii  
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me  
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii  
With all this loveliness there should be love  
  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea  
The night is young and so are we, so are we  
  
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you  
  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)  
The night is young and so are we (so are we)  
  
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you
