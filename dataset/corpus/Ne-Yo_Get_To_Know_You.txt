I bet you can't even walk down on a street!  
When I'm...  
Trying to phone you, trying to get around you.  
... Hear, once again in your ear, babe!  
I'ma kick back and try to find  
An originally way to speak my mind!  
  
Chorus:  
Uhuu, take it slow, no need to rush,  
I gotta think this through!  
Don't wanna make you think that all I want,  
It's just a physical thing, babe!  
I just wanna know you,  
You must hear this all the time  
I love you, but I just wanna love you!  
I just wanna love you!  
Baby, you don't even got to give me your number,  
You take mine,  
Call me when you're ready!  
Call me when you're ready!  
  
No I won't lie to you, baby!  
Your body is meticulous,  
But that's not all I see,  
When I look at you, baby!  
Say, I'm not impatient baby,  
Truthfully I will rather wait  
So I don't got to chase,  
When the time is right you just give it to me!  
  
Chorus:  
Uhuu, take it slow, no need to rush,  
I gotta think this through!  
Don't wanna make you think that all I want,  
It's just a physical thing, babe!  
I just wanna know you,  
You must hear this all the time  
I love you, but I just wanna love you!  
I just wanna love you!  
Baby, you don't even got to give me your number,  
You take mine,  
Call me when you're ready!  
Call me when you're ready!  
  
Babe, we don't have to rush,  
We can take our time when it comes to us, us!  
This is just a night,  
Who knows we might just fall in love
