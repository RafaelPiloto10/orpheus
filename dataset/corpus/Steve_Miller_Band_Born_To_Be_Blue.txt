Some folks were meant to live in clover  
But they are such a chosen few, chosen few  
And clover being green  
Is something I've never seen  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When there's a yellow moon above me  
They say there's moonbeams I should view, I should view  
But moonbeams being gold  
Are something I can't behold  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you  
The world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
I'd like to laugh  
But nothing strikes me funny  
Now my world's a faded pastel, oh well  
  
I guess I'm luckier than some folks  
Woo woo woo  
I've known the thrill of lovin' you, lovin' you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you  
The world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
I'd like to laugh  
But nothing strikes me funny  
Now my world's a faded pastel, oh well  
  
I guess I'm luckier than some folks  
I've known the thrill of lovin' you, lovin' you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue  
Woo woo
