Everybody likes to take a holiday  
Everybody likes to take a rest  
Spending time together with the family  
Sharing lots of love and happiness.  
  
Come on, ring those bells,  
Light the Christmas tree,  
Jesus is the king  
Born for you and me.  
Come on, ring those bells,  
Every-body sing,  
Jesus, we remember  
It's your birthday.  
  
Celebrations come because of something new.  
Celebrations we love to recall  
Mary had a baby born in Bethleham  
The greatest celebration of them all.  
  
Come on, ring those bells,  
Light the Christmas tree,  
Lord is the King  
Born for you and me.  
Come on, ring those bells,  
Every-body sing,  
O lord, we remember  
This your birthday
