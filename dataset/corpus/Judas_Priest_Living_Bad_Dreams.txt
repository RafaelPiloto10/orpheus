I'm hypnotised  
And helpless  
Beneath the pale  
Full moon  
My body is your sacrifice  
You spirit's coming soon  
  
I stare up at a  
Squalid night  
  
It's been so cold  
And smooth  
Turns tender kisses  
Into bites  
As you begin to move  
  
You look so weak  
And fragile  
You seem to drip  
And sway  
But you swept me up into  
Your arms  
And carried me away  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
You led me to temptation  
Delivered me to pain  
I walked upon you  
Hallowed ground  
My soul is yours to gain  
  
Your passion drains  
My energy  
Fear starts running deep  
I'm falling in  
Slow motion  
Into eternal sleep  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
[Lead Break]  
  
Your passion drains  
My energy  
Fear starts running deep  
I'm falling in  
Slow motion  
Into eternal sleep  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
There's nothing  
I can do  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
I can't run from you  
I'm living bad dreams  
This nightmare's  
Coming true  
  
I'm living bad dreams  
Ohh ohh  
I don't want bad dreams  
Living bad dreams
