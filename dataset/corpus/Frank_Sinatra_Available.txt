Anytime you call, I'm so available, anytime you call,  
(Anytime, anytime) Anytime at all, I'm so available, anytime at all.  
(Anytime, anytime) Don't have to bring a cake or a band home,  
You don't have to phone ahead.  
  
Make no mistake, I'm still the old standby,  
I am as you might guess, at the old address,  
Chances are that you are unassailable and that we are through.  
(Chances are, chances are)  
  
But what can I do, I'm still available, just like the first evening star,  
You can trust that I'll be there, summer, spring or fall,  
I'm in love and available, anytime at all.  
(But what could I do, I'm still available, like the first evening star)  
  
You can trust that I'll be there, summer, spring or fall,  
I'm in love and available, anytime at all.
