Half the world is sleeping,  
half the world's awake  
half can hear their hearts beat  
half just hear them break  
  
I am but a traveler, in most every way  
Ask me what you want... to know  
  
What a journey it has been  
And the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and they're bound to guide my way  
  
When they're shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I won't let the darkness in,  
what a journey it has been.  
  
I have been to sorrow  
I have been to bliss  
Where I'll be tomorrow,  
I can only guess  
  
Through the darkest desert  
Through the deepest snow,  
Forward always forward, I go...  
  
What a journey it has been  
and the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and they're bound to guide my way  
  
When they're shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I won't let the darkness in,  
what a journey it has been...  
  
Forward, always forward...  
Onward, always up...  
Catching every drop of hope  
In my empty cup  
  
What a journey it has been  
And the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and they're bound to guide my way  
  
When they're shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I won't let the darkness in,  
what a journey it has been...  
  
What a journey it has been...
