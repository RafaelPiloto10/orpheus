She surprises me, sometimes she hums on my balls  
And I can see the world right through her bedroom walls  
She has a jaw like a pelican's beak is deep  
Humming me right to sleep, my favortie freak  
I can rearrange the patterns of the stars in the sky  
I can fly with the seagulls on the beach with the tide  
Cause she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air  
If I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now boogie  
That thing, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
I see my life flash before me  
I hear all my favortie song at one time  
(when she blow me) right before I actually go blind  
I'm running back and forth though the door of (in and out of) my mind  
(when she blow me) my favortie freak is so fine  
To have her hum in performance, the show is enormous  
Only two fans in attendance, these two in my pants  
(my balls) she's my favortie, she's got my standing applause  
Humming me into harmony, right through my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boggie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls  
Undo my belt, put down my drawers  
Kiss my dick and hum my balls  
Undo my belt, put down my drawers  
Kiss my dick and hum my balls  
And she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air  
If I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Hit me with the humdrum boogie  
That thing, oh goodie  
Come on put it on me bitch  
Right now, right now  
Boogie, that thing, my balls
