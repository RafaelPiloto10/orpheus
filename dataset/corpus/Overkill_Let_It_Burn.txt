Here-here, got the lock-down cover me  
Fear-fear, got the in to let it out  
So near, feel its breath all over me  
Everything is inside, nothing going out  
I hear you, I see you, I put you out  
I hate you, I love you, I burn you down  
Got the need, right here to let it out  
Got the need, light the match and let it burn  
[CH]  
Listen here to the fire, as it burns up your back  
Take your heart, gonna let it burn listen here to the fire  
You're sure lookin' tired with a knife in your back  
Through your heart, man that's gotta burn, listen here to the fire  
Unclear where to start and where to end  
I know what the need is all about  
So near I can feel it eating me  
Everything upside, upside down  
I smell you, I taste you, what you're about  
I loath you, I adore you to the ground  
Got the need right here to let it out  
Got the need, light the match and let it burn  
[CH]  
[BR]  
I don't seek the answers to the questions that I learn  
I don't start the fires I lay back and watch them burn  
I see ashes floating transformed the way they used to be  
I see ashes floating down they come to cover me
