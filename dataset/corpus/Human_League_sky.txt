And after such a blazing day  
At last the breeze began to play  
I drained my glass and turned to see  
Her face she smiled she spoke to me  
I told her my name I asked her the same  
She said they call me sky  
Sky  
Said she is in danger maybe a stranger  
Might know a place near by  
And she talked and she smoked little more than a job  
All the cares of my life went away on that day  
In that room coming out of the gloom  
And the gift that she gave follow me to the grave from on  
Life goes on  
Now you gone  
Life goes on after sky  
Life goes on after sky  
So much can change without a sign  
A twist of fate two worlds alight  
The words get spoken all worlds were broken  
The wind began to sign  
The heat of daybreak the precious keepsake  
Too soon the last goodbye  
And the death in her eyes come enraged of the skies  
For the day of my birth was the last day on earth  
Like a boat in the night gets a moment of light  
I could see what I've done what must be from now on  
Life goes on  
Now you're gone  
Life goes on after sky  
Life goes on after sky  
  
Ahhh sky  
Ahhh sky  
  
Life goes on  
Now you're gone  
Life goes on after sky  
Life goes on after sky  
  
Sky  
Sky
