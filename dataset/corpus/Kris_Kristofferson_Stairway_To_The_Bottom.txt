Well you've started again  
With the wife of a friend  
On another night you hope you won't recall  
And the wine that you're drinkin'  
Doesn't keep you from thinkin'  
Of the bitter taste that lingers in your soul  
As you listen to your lies  
Once again you realize  
That she doesn't mean a thing to you at all  
And I watch you climb that stairway  
To the bottom  
Every evening in that mirror on the wall  
  
You take pride in deceiving  
One who tried hard believin' in you  
Even after all the lies you told  
But each lie that you've spoken  
And each vow that you've broken  
Was a new nail in the coffin of your soul  
If you think someone's cryin'  
For the love that is dyin'  
With the trust that you betray each time you fall  
Look around you on that stairway to the bottom  
No one's watchin' but that mirror on the wall  
  
Look around you on that stairway to the bottom  
No one's watchin' but that mirror on the wall
