Are you sad  
Or just a little lonely  
I can see something  
Deep in your eyes  
Do you walk away  
Or do you come closer  
Are you looking for romance  
Or just a surprise  
  
(Stay for the night)  
For the night  
(Baby won't you play with me)  
Won't you play with me  
  
Don't wanna play no games  
Don't wanna put you through changes  
All I wanna know is girl  
What's on your mind  
DO you think about me  
The way I think about you  
Don't wanna rush this thing  
I wanna take my time  
  
Stay for the night  
Baby won't you play with me  
Stay for the night  
Get away with me  
  
Come let me in  
Come on let me show you  
What you've been missing  
What you've been looking for  
I know what you want  
I know what you've been feeling  
All you gotta do girl  
Is just let me go  
  
Stay for the night, stay for the night baby  
Baby won't you play with me, won't you play with me  
Stay for the night, stay for the night  
Get away with me, get away with me  
  
Y'know that I love you  
Y'know that I'm the only one for you  
Let me give you what you need  
Come on stay with me  
Girl let me have you  
Let me do what I want to do with you baby  
I promise that I'll do you good  
I wanna touch you  
I wanna hold you baby
