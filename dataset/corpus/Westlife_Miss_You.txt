I can't sleep, I just can't breathe  
When your shadow is all over me, baby  
Don't wanna be a fool in your eyes  
'Cause what we had was built on lies  
And when our love seems to fade away  
Listen to me hear what I say  
  
I don't wanna feel the way that l do  
I just wanna be right here with you  
I don't wanna see, see us apart  
I just wanna say it straight from my heart  
"I miss you"  
  
What would it take for you to see  
To make you understand that I'll always believe  
You and I can make it through  
And I still know I can't get over you  
'Cause when our love seems to fade away  
Listen to me hear what I say  
  
I don't wanna feel the way that I do  
I just wanna be right here with you  
I don't wanna see, see us apart  
I just wanna say it straight from my heart  
"Oh baby I miss you, I do"  
  
'Cause when our love always fades away  
Listen to me hear what I say  
  
I don't wanna feel the way that I do  
I just wanna be right here with you  
I don't wanna see, see us apart  
I just wanna say it straight from my heart  
"I miss you, I miss you, I do"  
  
I don't wanna feel the way that I do  
I just wanna be right here with you  
I don't wanna see, see us apart  
I just wanna say it straight from my heart  
"Oh baby I miss you, I do"
