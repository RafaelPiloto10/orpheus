Flattop guitar  
Down around the campfire  
You can smell that hickory burnin'  
Catfish fryin'  
Onions got us cryin'  
Hushpuppies they're a turnin'  
Friends and kin comin' down the hill  
  
Trippin' in the ole starlight  
Cookin' and kickin' do a little pickin'  
Party tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on down to the moonlight longe  
Where the ceilin' is so blue  
Where there ain't no door and our dance floor  
Is covered with mountain dew  
Where there ain't no walls and the waterfall  
Is the only sound around  
Yeah we're havin' us a party down in the holler  
We call it the moonlight lounge  
  
Me and my lady  
Rode in on sadie  
A fourteen hand chestnut mare  
A midnight hoot owl  
He's screechin' so loud  
Kind of puts a chill in the summer air  
The bushes are wigglin', somebody's gigglin'  
Buck couldn't wait to get a kiss  
Jimmy's got the four wheel hooked to the wagon  
A hay ride you don't want to miss  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
Won't you... (repeat chorus again)  
Tag  
Yeah we're havin' us a party everybody holler  
We call it the moonlight lounge
