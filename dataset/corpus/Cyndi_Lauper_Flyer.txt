(piano)  
  
When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
  
Flyer fly me away  
Higher til I can't see  
Glider keeper of my dreams  
Of whatever once was me  
  
I was thinking of you  
I was thinking all I was just thinking  
Fly me away  
Flyer  
You could make it last a long time  
Well for all time  
And for always  
You could make it last forever  
Was just thinking  
Oh I was just thinking I was I was  
  
Oh  
Flyer dancing on the skylite  
By play of my youth  
Like a cryer clinging to a shadow  
I go on and on and on on  
And wishin' and  
Thinking of you  
  
I was thinking oh I was just thinking  
Fly me away  
Flyer  
  
You could make it last a long time  
Well, for all time  
For always  
You could make it last forever  
Was just thinking  
Oh I was just thinking I was I was  
Oh....la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  
La la la  
La la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  
  
(guitar solo )  
  
So when I sing my song  
When my heart is beating stronger  
I'm flying away  
Flying away  
Ohhhhh  
Fly me away  
Fly me away  
Yeah (flyer)  
  
La la la la la laaaa la la  
La la laaaaaaaaaaaaaa  
La  
La la la la la laaaa la la  
La la laaaaaaaaaaaaa  
(Ahoo) spin  
(Loco voy frio o lo soplo)  
(Esto ya va ilammdo)
