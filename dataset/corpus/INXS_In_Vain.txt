Well just the other day  
While alone in my room  
I said to myself  
I need something new  
I've cut a new life slice  
And feed the lions twice  
And they'll shake their manes in confusion  
  
My love  
My love's in vain  
My love  
  
My love  
My love's in vain  
My love  
  
Put a bet on everything  
It'll come up fine  
My fingers are crossed  
And tapping in time  
You got a pretty face  
Such a pretty pretty face  
You can brush your own mane  
Fame is your pain  
  
My love  
My love's in vain  
My love  
  
My love  
My love's in vain  
My love  
  
Maybe an older woman  
Will show me a way  
To ease those creases  
And crave no reasons  
'Cause reasons are with gods  
There's a heaven within me  
But we all shake our manes in confusion  
  
Should I grab you by the collar  
Or just go my way  
With a knife between my clean white teeth  
Don't want your feather in my cap  
Don't care about that  
You can brush your own mane  
Fame is your pain
