Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud.  
So good I can't believe it, screaming with the crowd.  
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.  
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.  
Overkill, overkill, overkill  
  
On your feet you feel the beat, it goes straight to your spine.  
Shake your head you must be dead if it don't make you fly.  
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.  
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.  
Overkill, overkill, overkill  
  
Know your body's made to move, ya feel it in your guts.  
Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name if it don't make a strut.  
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.  
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you.  
Overkill, overkill, overkill
