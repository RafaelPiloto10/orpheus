Too late to think or filter anymore  
A bitter pill to swallow  
Maybe you're in a blanket haze of ephedrine  
I'm wonderin' where the hell you been  
So come on and right this wrong, the rope  
  
You got it all right  
You got a feeling  
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go  
You got it all right  
You got a feeling  
'Cause devils and ropes around your neck  
Cursing them all  
And you can't hear it  
Can't hear it  
  
Ain't got a mind to deal with anymore  
Saboteur, infiltrator, and maybe more  
If you're not blind and deaf, how can we pollute your head?  
So come on and right this wrong, the rope  
  
And I got it all right  
I got a feeling  
You'd rather open up your wrist, and let it go  
I got it all right, yeah  
I got a feeling  
'Cause devils and ropes around my neck can't even know  
'Cause they can't hear it  
Can't hear it  
Can't hear it  
Can't hear it
