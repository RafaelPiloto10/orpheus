Do or die that is my question  
A little seed burning in me  
It's hot I must get water  
Racing towards the sun  
Do or die break or burn  
I've still got so much to learn  
My breath is tearing with the dying sun  
Racing towards the sun  
I can't breath  
I got sucked underneath  
She won't fight for breath now  
Have a little taste of death now  
Rise and fall rise and fall  
I've seen it all  
Racing towards the sun
