Crossing every ocean for the sake of locomotion  
Crossing every ocean for the sake of locomotion  
  
Across every ocean  
For the sake of locomotion  
But I wouldn't have a notion  
How to save my soul  
I walk down the sidewalk  
Run down the boardwalk  
Stop and make small talk  
But I can't say no to you  
  
I can't say no I can't say yes  
I can't even write down my own address  
I can't touch heaven it's a little too far  
It's the only way to travel  
Got dreaming on a par  
I'm staring through the window  
Wondering where you are  
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour  
  
Across every nation  
From the harbour to the station  
It's a form of inspiration  
It's a power to the state  
They run down the railways  
Sail across the seaways  
Fly through the airways  
But they can't say no  
To you  
  
I can't stand up I can't stand still  
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel  
I just want to say that it's only common sense  
But the words always fail me at my own expense  
I'm staring out the window  
Wonder where you are  
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour  
  
Across every ocean  
For the sake of locomotion  
But I wouldn't have a notion  
How to save my soul  
I walk down the sidewalk  
Run down the boardwalk  
Stop and make small talk  
But I can't say no to you
