One night with you  
One dream come true  
One love no man can deny  
The good in your eye  
  
One life undone  
One song unsung  
My world of fire and ice  
Become paradise  
Elysium come true in loving you  
  
One angel of man  
Giving me wings to a promised land  
Leaving the world behind  
  
One night with you  
One sky come blue  
One night no rhymes can reveal  
The heaven I feel  
Elysium come true in loving you
