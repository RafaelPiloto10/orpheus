So sick and tired of living  
And so afraid to die  
I've lived so many lives  
And still I wonder why  
The way the world perceives me  
Is not the way I am  
The one half thinks I'm crazy  
The other thinks I'm mad  
  
I spent a long long time alone in my room  
I need your help to get me out of this gloom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
Ten thousand million nightmares  
Temptation by the score  
I used to get so high  
And still I wanted more  
You think my time is wasted  
In search of who I am  
I tried to so hard to kill  
The boy inside the man  
  
I spent a thousand years one night in my room  
I've lived so many lives and that is my doom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
I never thought I'd smile again  
Always thought I'd be here on my own  
Sometimes when I'm down  
You come and save me again  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
I'll never understand it  
It makes no sense at all  
Just look at what I've done  
It's time to count the score  
  
I've spent a long long time alone in my room  
I need your help to get me out of this gloom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out
