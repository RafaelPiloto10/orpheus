Think of me and miss me, as I'll be missing you  
Promise to be true and I'll be true to you  
Dream of me and talk to me, though we're far apart  
I will hear you dear, hear you in my heart  
When you're all alone and you're feelin' blue  
Remember that I'm here and I'll be lonely too  
And the sun will shine and our love will grow  
Oh, time cannot erase a love like ours, I know  
So, think of me and miss me, as I'll be missing you  
Promise to be true and I'll be true to you
