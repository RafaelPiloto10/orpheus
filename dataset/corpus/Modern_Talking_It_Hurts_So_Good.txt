I watched the stars oh one by one  
Why you left me so alone  
Oh, why, oh why, you break my heart  
I watched the stars, I think of you  
Oh, I'm just the biggest fool  
Oh, why I let you break apart  
Oh, why, oh why, you break my heart  
  
It hurt's so good, to be in love  
You are the girl, I'm living for  
It hurts so good, to be in love  
Oh, I need you more and more  
It hurts so good, you're in my heart  
I love you more and more each day  
It hurts so good, let's try a start  
Oh, baby come what may  
You are with me, where I belong  
My heart can't get enough  
  
What's good for me is good for you  
Oh, I'll never make you blue  
Oh, why, oh why you break my heart  
From coast to coast and sky to sky  
Oh, there is no reason why  
Oh, why I let you break apart  
Oh, why, oh why, you break my heart
