I wandered near and far  
I wished upon a star  
And darling here you are, at last  
My guardian angel must have sent you  
To find me  
  
Now I've left the heartaches, behind me  
Although the road was long  
I thought that i was strong  
And now the saddest song is passed  
  
In this big world, full of losers  
The beggars can't be choosers  
I wished on my star and here you are at last  
  
In this big world, full of losers  
The beggars can't be choosers  
I wished on my star and here you are at last
