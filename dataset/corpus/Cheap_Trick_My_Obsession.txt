Pour out your heart  
The feelings never fade away  
So where are you now  
I loved you more than I can say  
You wouldn't see couldn't touch can't believe it's true  
  
Your love feels like home  
You're my obsession  
All the things we did  
What's left is just a photograph  
Everything I held so close  
Was never meant to last  
  
You're in my heart  
It's never gonna fade away  
Your love feels like home  
You're my obsession  
  
If I could find all the dreams I've made  
I'd turn the clock back to yesterday  
To hold onto what I got with you  
Shine bright like all the stars  
Unlock every dream I've made  
I'd turn tomorrow into yesterday  
All the things we did  
  
What's left is just a photograph  
You wouldn't see couldn't touch can't believe it's true  
Your love feels like home  
You're my obsession
