(do not stop on tracks)  
I went down one day, I went down one day to see a gypsy woman,  
Just one old day, yes I did,  
I want to find out, I want to find out,  
I want to find out, I want to find out now,  
What's wrong with me and my baby.  
We ain't gettin' down like we used to do,  
I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time,  
When it didn't work too well.  
I went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand,  
I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on.  
And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need,  
She said all you got to have, oh lord,  
Just a touch of mojo's hand, oh bring it back on,  
And it feels pretty good, yes indeed.
