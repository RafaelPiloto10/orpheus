Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I'm so in love with you  
Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I know you're in love with me to  
Should we go on living together?  
Or should we get married right away?  
Whatever you decide,  
I'll still love you, baby  
And we'll grow stronger everyday  
Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I barely have enough money for two  
Baby, what are we gonna do?  
I don't want to regret what I've done to you  
I never would've thought that this would happen  
To a very careful man like me  
But baby, pretty baby, we're gonna work it out, yeah  
I love you, I love you, can't you see?  
  
Baby, baby, baby  
It's you, 'said it's you that I truly adore  
Oh, baby, baby (baby, baby)  
Oh, baby, babe,  
I hope our baby has eyes just like yours (just like yours)
