I'm sick and tired hearing all these people study about  
What's the deal with this school life and when is it gonna fade out?  
The thing you've got to realise what we're doing is James Ruse trend  
We've got the books 'til insanity, we're gonna study to the end  
  
C'mon now...  
It doesn't matter  
'Bout the textbooks that I balance on my head  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize that it's just about results  
It doesn't matter  
'Bout the books I read, or what I learn and why  
All that matters  
Is that we're the best and we top you every time  
  
C'mon now...  
Do you every wonder why  
The study gets you high?  
It takes you on a ride  
You feel it when your  
Brain starts to fry  
Your social life will die  
And the books' are all you've got  
This must be... Ruse!  
  
Techy Ruse  
Nerd, nerd you can't stop  
I know you love this  
Techy Ruse  
This must be...  
  
Now, why is the highest uai your passion through and through?  
Why can't you chill and do the things you once used to do?  
If a day without your math book will cut like a knife,  
Drop your pens and burn your notes and go and get a life...  
  
It doesn't matter  
That I don't need a calculator  
All that matters  
Is that you recognize it's just about results  
It doesn't matter  
'Bout the news I watch, or news I read, and why  
All that matters  
Is that we're the best and we'll top you anytime  
  
C'mon  
Do you every wonder why (why?)  
The study gets you high? (gets you high)
