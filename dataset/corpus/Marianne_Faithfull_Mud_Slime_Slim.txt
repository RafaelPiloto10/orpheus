Mud Slime Slim and the blue horizon,  
Oh, Mud Slime and depending on you.  
I don't know but I've been told  
There's a time from time to time  
I can't eat, I can't sleep  
But I just like to move my feet  
'Cause there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music  
To change your lady's mind  
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind.  
Mud Slime, I'm depending on you,  
Mr. Mud Slime Slim on the blue horizon.  
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,  
Yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.  
I wanted cash in my hand  
Pick upon a piece of land  
Build myself a cabin back in the woods.  
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts changing for the good.  
Now the reason I'm smiling  
Is over on an island  
On a hillside in the woods where I belong.  
I wanna thank Jimmy Jimmy John and Mick and Robbie  
Of Nojets Construction to send me down homestead on a farm.  
Oh, Mud Slime, I'm depending on you.  
Mr. Mud Slim on the blue horizon.  
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,  
Yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.
