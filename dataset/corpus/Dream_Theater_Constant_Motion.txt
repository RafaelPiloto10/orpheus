Tunnel vision at blinding speed  
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me  
Void of any uncertainty  
Throughout my very soul  
  
Lost illusions of my control  
Resisting all hope of letting go  
Racing impulse of dark desire  
Drives me through the night  
  
I try to shut it down  
It leaves me in the dust  
No matter what I've found  
I can never get enough  
  
Frantic actions of insanity  
Impulsive laced profanity  
Long for elusive serenity  
Way out of my control  
  
[Chorus:]  
Traveling through both space and time  
(Out of body, out of mind)  
Out of control, my wheels in constant motion  
Spinning round and round it goes  
(I can't let up, I can't let go)  
Can't stop this flame from burning  
Forever more, into the night, blistering  
  
Focus here, focus there  
Cannot see the light  
(Falling down through the night)  
Sprawling everywhere  
Searching left, searching right  
(Panic setting in, I can no longer fight)  
When will this end?  
Accelerate, dislocate  
(Set to crash and burn, haven't got time to waste)  
Not planning to return  
Aggravate, agitate  
(When will I ever learn?)  
There's no way out of here  
Nowhere to turn  
  
Obsessive yearning  
Compulsive burning  
Still never learning  
Insane random thoughts of neat disorder  
  
Scattered wasteland surrounding me  
Tattered memories of what used to be  
Apocalyptic mind debris  
Until we meet again  
(Uh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Traveling through both space and time  
(Out of body, out of mind)  
Out of control, my wheels in constant motion  
Spinning round and round it goes  
(I can't let up, I can't let go)  
Can't stop this flame from burning  
Can't stop the wheels from turning  
  
[Chorus]
