I know something about  
Opening windows and doors  
I know how to move quietly  
To creep across creaky wooden floors  
I know where to find  
Precious things in all  
Your cupboards and drawers  
Slipping the clippers  
Slipping the clippers  
Through the telephone wires  
The sense of isolation inspires  
Inspires me  
I like to feel the suspense  
When I'm certain you know I am there  
I like you lying awake,  
Your baited breath charging the air  
I like the touch and the smell  
Of all the pretty dresses you wear  
Intruders happy in the dark  
Intruder come  
Intruder come and leave his mark,  
Leave his mark
