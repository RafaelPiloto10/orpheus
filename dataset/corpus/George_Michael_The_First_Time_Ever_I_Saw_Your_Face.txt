The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
The moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and empty skies, my love  
To the dark and empty skies  
  
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move in my hands  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command, my love  
That was there  
  
And the first time ever I lay with you  
And felt you heart so close to mine,  
And I knew our joy would fill the earth  
It would last till the end of time, my love  
It would last till the end of time  
The first time ever I saw your face  
Your face, your face
