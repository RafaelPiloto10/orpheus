I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you  
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town  
I'm counting my sheep and  
each one that passes is another dream to ashes and they all fall down.  
  
As I lay me down tonight,  
I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight  
  
I'm sleeping to dream about you  
I'm so tired of having to live without you  
But I don't mind  
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired  
  
I found myself in the riches your eyes, your lips, your hair  
Well you were everywhere  
But I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here  
but you were nowhere. You were nowhere at home.  
  
As I lay me back to sleep  
Lord I pray that I can keep  
  
Sleeping to dream about you  
I'm so tired of having to live without you  
But I don't mind  
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired  
  
It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at
night  
  
Sleeping to dream about you  
I'm so tired of having to live without you  
But I don't mind  
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
