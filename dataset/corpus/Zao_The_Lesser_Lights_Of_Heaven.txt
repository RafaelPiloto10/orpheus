The lesser lights of heaven are burning towards a dream  
The eyes of mothers bleeding  
Cast their children to the sea  
  
The lesser lights of heaven are screaming in our mind  
Listen to the chorus  
So divine and unkind  
  
The lesser lights of heaven are burning for their Son  
Praying for the presence  
That birthed them into one  
  
The lesser lights of heaven, their bodies but a flame  
A sky that knows no distance  
A cut that feels no pain  
  
The lesser lights of heaven are bending towards your will  
Cutting through the person  
Who would rather die than kill  
  
The lesser lights of heaven cast crowns before your throne  
Dissipate into nothing  
We truly are alone  
  
Can we live through this? The lesser lights of heaven
