Won't deny everything can't last  
But it's closing in so fast  
Thought that I'd figured it out at last  
But you can't change the past  
And it's closing in so fast  
Feels just like we're dancing in the wind  
Feeling just all right  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
Just don't walk away  
When I've got you in my arms tonight  
And I've got something to say  
There are still rules to break  
And this music is a place to hide  
Isn't it just a game we play  
Feels just like we're dancing in the wind  
Feeling just all right  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
Feels just like we're dancing in the wind  
Feeling just alright  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
We can dance all night  
When we're dancing in the wind  
We can dance all night
