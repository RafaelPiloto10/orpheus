For now and always  
I'll hold you tight day and night  
Keep the love light burnin' bright in my heart for you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I'll love you for now and always  
I'll break a date to roller skate  
To sit up late just to wait at the gate for you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I'll love you for now and always  
For your sake time I'll take a pretty bungalow  
I'll even learn to make for you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I'll love you for now and always  
I'll do my work like a Turk  
I'll never shirk, I'll be a butcher boy or clerk for you  
  
Love is like a roller coaster  
Running upside down  
Gonna make a great big poster  
Spread the news around  
  
For now and always  
You'll always be the one for me  
Can't you see that I'll always be in love with you?  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I'll love you for now and always  
I'll do the chores, sweep the floors  
From the stores, 'cause I'll always adore you  
  
Not for a day, not for a year  
Not for a century, but forever dear  
  
For now and always  
I can't deny my heart will fly  
To the sky when I sing a lullaby with you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I'll love you for now and always  
There'll be three, you and me  
Someone sweet as she can be who looks just like you  
  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Pretty little sweetheart  
Pretty little sweetheart  
I love you
