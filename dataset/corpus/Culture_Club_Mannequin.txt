He's the mannequin of your dreams  
You designed him  
Nothing will stand in your way  
A punch in the heart  
Won't tear him apart  
Neither will the things they say  
  
'Cause he's a beggar, lover, believer  
You are just an innocent reader  
  
He's the mannequin of your dreams  
Step inside him  
Look at the world his way  
Laughter is loud  
From the fool in the crowd  
You'll crack his smile one day  
  
Every dream must follow where we go  
Don't let them shatter your ego  
  
Mannequin, lover mannequin, lover mannequin [Repeat: x2]  
I gave you every bit of my time  
You lied and you committed a crime  
To present my feelings  
With shallow meanings  
How could you tear me apart?  
  
He's the mannequin of your dreams  
You denied him  
Laughter and political sway  
People are sweet  
But the primitive beat  
Is always getting in my way  
  
I can give you nothing but me though  
It isn't what you want to see  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh Mannequin, lover mannequin  
My lover mannequin, whoa
