All of Paris giggles with flags  
Laughing lions leap up from the page  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
Barcelona, nuclear festive, wire women  
  
Wriggle from life's cage  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks like it's all a party  
Packed with my paint heroes  
  
Like it's all a party  
Packed with Rousseau  
Miro, Miro, on my wall  
I love you the most of all  
In Port Lligat, liked his Gala  
Waxed antenna, brushes up a storm  
  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
Catalonia's atom caveman  
  
Cracks his whipline tipped in purest form  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks like it's all a party  
  
Packed with my paint heroes  
Like it's all a party  
Packed with Dali  
Miro, Miro, on my wall  
I love you the most of all
