They used to call him Jesus  
Long time ago  
They're still calling him Jesus  
Don't you know  
They crossed the wood and hanged him  
A long time ago  
They still misunderstand him  
Those who don't know  
And in the evening his love will lead the blind  
In every secret corner there in your mind  
  
They called him Gautama Buddha  
Oh long time ago  
He turned the world to order  
Don't you know  
He used to sit knowing  
Oh long time ago  
Where you and me were going  
And in the evening his love will lead the blind
