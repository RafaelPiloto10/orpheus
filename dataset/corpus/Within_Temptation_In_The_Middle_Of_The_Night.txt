I've been walking this road of desire,  
I've been begging for blood on the wall.  
I don't care if I'm playing with fire,  
I'm aware that I'm frozen inside.  
I have known all along.  
  
So much more going on, no denying,  
But I know I'm not standing alone  
  
You've been playing my mind through my wishes.  
You can feel that we're haunting the truth.  
Don't know, I can't hold on, always losing control.  
  
In the middle of the night,  
I don't understand what's going on  
It's a world gone astray.  
In the middle of the night,  
I can't let it out.  
Someone keeps searching  
And shatters your life  
It will never be afraid  
In the middle of the night  
  
No more tears,  
No, 'cause nothing else matters  
I've been closing my eyes for too long.  
  
Only vengeance will make me feel better.  
There's no rest till I know that it's done.  
  
You've been playing my mind through my wishes  
You can feel that we're haunting the truth  
Don't know, I can't hold on, always losing control  
  
In the middle of the night,  
I don't understand what's going on  
It's a world gone astray.  
In the middle of the night,  
I can't let it out.  
Someone keeps searching  
And shatters your life  
It will never be afraid  
In the middle of the night  
  
In the middle of the night  
In the middle of the night  
  
In the middle of the night,  
I don't understand what's going on  
It's a world gone astray.  
In the middle of the night,  
I can't let it out.  
Someone keeps searching  
And shatters your life  
It will never be afraid  
In the middle of the night
