In my song Jah is the melody  
In my song he is the symphony  
In my song he is the sweet inspiration  
In my song it's the perfect meditation  
  
When I'm feeling down  
Got nowhere to go  
I get into myself  
And I put on a show  
  
In my song Jah is the melody  
In my song he is everything to me  
In my song he is the musical beat  
In my song he is the rhythm and tempo  
  
And when you're feeling out  
Don't sit down and cry  
Don't forget  
That the music is passing by  
  
In my song Jah is the melody  
In my song he is everything to me  
In my song he is the sweet inspiration  
In my song there is no complication  
  
'Cause in times like these  
When people don't know what to do  
And getting so frustrated  
Get into yourself and sing  
  
In my song Jah is the melody  
In my song he is the symphony  
In my song he is the rhythm  
In my song he's everything to me  
  
In my song  
In my song no complication  
In my song Jah is the melody  
In my song he is the sweet inspiration  
  
In my song he is the symphony  
In my song he makes it feel so good  
In my song is a blessing to my soul  
In my song can't go outta control  
  
In my song it is a medicine to me  
In my song relieve my frustration
