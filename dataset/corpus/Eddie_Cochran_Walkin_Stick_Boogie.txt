Old dancin' dick with his walkin' stick  
Should have seen him when he got off the train  
He had all the people standin' in the rain  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
Watchin' the walkin' stick boogie  
He's the fastest man that ever danced into town  
He's got the fastest kick, with his walkin' stick  
You should see the way that he throws it around  
When he dances upside down, doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
He's got the people jumpin' just like the fleas on a hound  
  
You should see the way that the chicks get their kicks  
When ol' dick gets to throw his walkin' stick  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
The joint was so hot  
That the boards were flyin' off the floor  
The girls all cried, when he said goodbye  
They knew that the town would be on the bum  
And they couldn't have anymore fun  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie, the walkin' stick boogie  
It was a very sad day when ol' dick danced out of town
