You're the type of guy that can't control your girl  
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls  
I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene  
And gets the seven digits, you know the routine  
You're the type of guy that tells her, "Stay inside"  
While you're steady fronting in your homeboy's ride  
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave  
I'm doing your girlfriend, that's something you can't believe  
Cause I'm that type of guy  
  
You're the type of guy that gets suspicious  
I'm the type of guy that says, "The pudding is delicious"  
You're the type of guy that has no idea  
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneaking in from the rear  
I'm the type of guy to eat it, when he won't  
And look in the places that your boyfriend don't  
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk  
Now knowing that your main girl's biting my chunk  
I'm the type of guy that loves a dedicated lady  
Their boyfriends are boring, and I can drive em crazy  
You're the type of guy to give her money to shop  
She gave me a sweater kiss thank you, sweetheart  
I'm that type of guy  
  
I'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early  
Takes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast  
You're the type of guy eating a TV dinner  
Talking about "Goddamn it, I'ma kill her"  
I'm the type of guy to make her say, "Why you're illing, Bee?"  
You're the type of guy to say, "My lower back is killing me"  
Catch my drift?  
You're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English  
I'm the type of guy to cold put on a pamper  
You're the type of guy to say, "What you talking bout?"  
I'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper  
I'm that type of guy  
  
I'm that type of guy  
You know what I mean?  
Check it out  
  
T-y-p-e g-u-y  
I'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye  
Like a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted  
But when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it  
Cause you're the type of guy that don't know the time  
Swearing up and down, "That girl's all mine"  
I'm the type of guy to let you keep believing it  
Go 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it  
I'm that type of guy  
  
I'm that type of guy  
  
Know what I mean  
  
I'm that type of guy  
  
"So ridiculous"  
  
So funny  
I don't know  
Come on down  
Yeah  
Like real cool, you know what I mean?  
I like just going to your front door ringing bells  
And just like, ha, leave
