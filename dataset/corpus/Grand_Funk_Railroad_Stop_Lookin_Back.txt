Stuck in the county jail,  
Nobody here gonna' pay my bail.  
Thirty days with a smelly drunk,  
A turn-key callin' me a dirty punk.  
I got to pick myself up, and stop lookin' back.  
And I've got to move straight ahead, stop lookin' back.  
  
Chorus  
Shoot for the stars when my eyes can't see the starlight.  
Reach for the sun in the night.  
Stop lookin' back at the times I was defeated,  
I pick myself up, I move straight ahead, I stop lookin' back.  
  
Stranded! nothing worse.  
I'm livin' on coffee, I got an empty purse.  
I'm dreamin' 'bout blue eyes lookin' my way,  
Hopin' my dreams don't blow away.  
I got to pick myself up, and stop lookin' back.  
And I've got to move straight ahead, stop lookin' back.  
  
Chorus
