For all these years  
I've been rushing and running away  
I have seen the cities  
The bars and the beaches are full  
To keep away from you  
I know I'll meet you  
One day, for a lifetime  
I'm scared  
One thousand years I could live on your smile  
I'm scared  
And run away forever  
  
For all that time I've been crazy  
There is no escape  
Come back to the city  
Come back in the hotel and wait  
The city waits forever
