I fell asleep in the silence  
Before the street fights the fire  
Free in the world that you've given  
Lay in the sound,  
The water still calls,  
Still calls  
Afraid of the dark that surrounds me  
Hide in the dirt of the ground  
Free in the wind that surrounds me  
I'm not afraid to sleep in the night  
Not afraid,  
To sleep in the night  
Free like a bird of the holders  
Holding the wake of the sun  
I know the road that you send me  
I know the way it leads to home  
Real like the bones in my body  
Real like the flesh that covers the grave  
It's real,  
Like the flesh  
That covers, The grave  
Wait for the guards that you send me  
Before I'll show myself,  
Wait for the storm that comes to me  
Maybe I'll just change my mind  
Plea for the will of forgiveness  
I'm not afraid to say I was wrong  
I was wrong  
Maybe I won't  
So long  
So long
