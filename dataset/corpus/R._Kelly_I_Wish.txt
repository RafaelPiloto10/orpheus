I wish, I wish, I wish  
To every city  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
Every hood  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
And every block  
Ghetto America!  
  
Rollin' through the hood  
Just stopped by to say what's up  
And let you know  
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough  
And even though you passed  
Going on four long years  
Still waking up late at night crying tears  
Just thinking about those days  
You used to talk to me  
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey  
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be  
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to kick it on the front porch  
(With you)  
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed  
(With you)  
And all the little basement party joints we'd do  
Now I'm just missing you  
How I wish  
  
[Chorus]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay  
And if I make it out this thug life  
I'll see you again someday  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
  
Now ever since this money come  
It's been nothing but stress  
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success  
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed  
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness  
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton  
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun  
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now  
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house  
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits  
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em  
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around  
But y'all don't want to raise the roof  
Until my shit is going down  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments  
(With you)  
And how I used to club hop on weekends  
(With you)  
Your family called the morning of the tragic end  
Damn, my condolences  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church  
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt  
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse  
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst  
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man  
And I try to keep it real with my homies now  
For me to save the world I don't understand  
How did I become the leader of a billion men?  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to street perform on Friday  
(With you)  
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday  
(With you)  
Standing here throwing them songs at me  
Somebody pray for me  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay
