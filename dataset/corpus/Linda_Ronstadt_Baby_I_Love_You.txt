Have I ever told you  
How good it feels to hold you  
It isn't easy to explain  
And though I really keep trying  
I think I may start crying  
My heart can't wait another day  
When you kiss me I just got to say  
Baby I love you (come on baby)  
Baby I love you (ooo-wee baby)  
Baby I love only you (baby I love only you)  
I can't live without you  
I love everything about you  
I can't help it if I feel this way  
Though I'm so glad I found you  
I want my arms around you  
I love to hear you call my name  
Oh tell me that you feel the same  
Baby I love you (come on baby)  
Baby I love you (ooo-wee baby)  
Baby I love only you (baby I love only you)
