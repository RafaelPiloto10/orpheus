Now I see the light that's shining from your eyes  
Even brighter than before  
Telling me something now that I believe is true  
Cause I found the truth with you  
  
I will take you with me everywhere I go  
Flying higher than before  
With a feeling that is meant for you and me  
Every day a little more  
  
If we see a way together as we go  
We will never be alone  
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
If I think of all the things that I have seen  
And when I looked at you and me  
When I think of all the things that I could do  
I could do them all with you  
I would do them all with you  
I will do them all for you
