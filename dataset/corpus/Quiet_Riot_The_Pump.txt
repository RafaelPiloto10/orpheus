Get ready  
Hah!  
We got blind compassion  
Don't need discussion  
Think you know just what I mean  
Nowhere's a smokin'  
While the rules are broken  
Had to be seen to be believed  
As a preacher of lust  
You gotta do what you must  
Practice what you preach  
If you got an invitation  
We'll change the location  
Gotta have room to breathe  
I want love, huh!  
Whole lotta love, tons!  
Give me love  
Our love  
Well let's pump her, pump her  
Strike it rich what you're dreamin' of  
(The Pump)  
Let's pump her, pump her  
(Damn)  
We're gonna hunt for gold  
Gonna dig for love  
The more I get  
The more I want  
Love mushes out my brain  
She's gotta move real slow  
High and low  
The girl's gonna drive me insane  
She's got a real cool cat  
That know where it's at  
Has to be the ultimate find  
Have you heard the score  
Ready for more  
I knew that the pump was the prize  
I want love  
Give your love  
Wow!  
Love  
Ooh  
Love  
Well let's pump her, pump her  
Strike it rich what you're dreamin' of  
Let's pump her, pump her  
(It's the way you find)  
We're gonna hunt for gold  
Gonna dig for love  
Oh get down  
Ooh! Ooh! Ow!  
C'mon  
Oh  
Push it baby  
Give it to me  
Oh yeah!  
I want love  
All your love  
Whole lotta love  
Cheap chime for love  
Well let's pump her, pump her  
(You know what I'm saying baby)  
Strike it rich what you're dreamin' of  
(C'mon give it to me)  
Let's pump her, pump her  
We're gonna hunt for gold  
Gonna dig for love  
One more  
Get down  
Ha!  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Oh! Oh! Oh!
