Baby knows  
Baby knows  
Baby knows, huh  
Baby knows  
  
(Baby knows) This funky joint in the city  
(Baby knows) Where the freaks come out to play  
(Baby knows) Venezuelan, black and pretty  
(Baby knows) The kind that make you want to pay, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
(Baby knows) She got the long dark legs  
(Baby knows) She got the butt that go round  
(Baby knows) This kind of poochie make you beg  
(Baby knows) Turn a dog into a hound  
  
(Baby knows) She tell me what I want to hear  
(Baby knows) She stroke me up and never down  
(Baby knows) Whispering sexiness in my ear  
(Baby knows) I'm just a junkie for the sound  
  
(Baby knows) She make you call your boys  
(Baby knows) In a pow-wow to scope a plan  
(Baby knows) How to ditch her man in a trunk of a Lexus  
A perplexing hex this witch has flexed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, baby, oh, baby  
Baby  
  
(Baby knows) She knows how to make you feel  
(Baby knows) Like your stuff ain't brown tonight  
(Baby knows) And her perfume, it smells like the weekend  
  
(Baby knows) This funky joint way down in the city  
(Baby knows) Where the girls sing along to the hip-hop all night long  
(Baby knows) White girls, black girls, Latina's, oh so pretty  
(Baby knows) Won't make me give you this ring, baby  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Yeah (Baby, baby)  
Baby knows  
Yeah-yeah (Baby, baby)  
Baby knows  
  
She got the long dark legs (Baby knows)  
She got the butt that go round (Round and round)  
This kind of poochie make you beg (Baby knows)  
  
Give me your number and I call you  
No, you do just turn me down
