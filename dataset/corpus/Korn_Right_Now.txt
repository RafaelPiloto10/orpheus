I'm feeling mean today  
Not lost, not blown away  
Just irritated and quite hated  
Self control breaks down  
Why's everything so tame  
I like my life insane  
I'm fabricating and debating  
Who I'm gonna kick around  
  
Right now  
Can't find a way  
To get across the hate  
When I see you  
  
Right now  
I feel it scratch inside  
I want to slash and beat you  
  
Right now  
I rip apart the things inside  
That excite you  
  
Right now  
I can't control myself  
But I fucking hate you!  
  
I'm feeling cold today  
Not hurt just fucked away  
I'm devastated and frustrated  
God I feel so bound  
So why I'd feel the need  
I think it's time to bleed  
I'm gonna cut myself and  
Watch the blood hit the ground  
  
Right now  
Can't find a way  
To get across the hate  
When I see you  
  
Right now  
I feel it scratch inside  
I want to slash and beat you  
  
Right now  
I rip apart the things inside  
That live beside you  
  
Right now  
I can't control myself  
But I fucking hate you!  
  
You open your mouth again  
I swear I'm gonna break it  
You open your mouth again,  
By god I cannot take it  
  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
  
Right now  
Can't find a way  
To get across the hate  
When I see you  
  
Right now  
I feel it scratch inside  
I want to slash and beat you  
  
Right now  
I rip apart the things inside  
That live beside you  
  
Right now  
I can't control myself  
But I fucking hate you!  
  
I fuckin' hate you [Repeat x8]
