My piano is my endless song  
She's a warm and a wonderful friend  
Of taverns and gershwin and a world  
We woo till we end  
Hey old gal may I ask you  
Could no one love you more so much more than me  
My piano is my endless song  
Such a warm and a faithful melody  
And oh all the tears we cried and we've dried just you and me  
Hey old gal may I ask you  
Does jesus love you more much much more than me.
