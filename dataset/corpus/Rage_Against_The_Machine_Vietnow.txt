Turn on tha radio, nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it, turn it off  
Turn it off, turn on tha radio, nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it, your saviour's my guillotine, crosses and kerosene  
  
Merge on tha networks, slangin' nerve gas  
Up jump tha boogie then bang, let 'em hang  
While tha paraniod try ta stuff tha void  
Let's capture this AM mayhem  
Undressed, and blessed by tha Lord  
Tha power pendulum swings by tha umbilical cord  
Shock around tha clock, from noon 'til noon  
Men grabbin' they mics, and stuff 'em into tha womb  
Terror's tha product ya push  
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I gotta headrush  
Sheep tremble an here come tha votes  
Thrown from tha throat, new cages an scapegoats  
Undressed and blessed by tha Lord  
Tha same devil that ran around Managua wit a sword  
Check out tha new style that Ollie found  
I tune in wit a bullet ta shut down tha devil sound  
Shut down tha devil sound  
Tha program of Vietnow  
Shut down tha devil sound  
  
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it, turn it off  
Turn it off, turn on the radio, nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it, your saviour's my guillotine, crosses and kerosene  
  
Flex tha cerebellum, fire, uh!  
Somebody gotta shell 'em  
These evil angels lists, hittin' tha AM playlist  
Paid ta say this  
That one inhuman, illegal, single woman  
Tha one wit out a room  
The transmissions wippin' our backs  
Yeah, comin' down like bats from Stacy Coon  
Terror's tha product ya push  
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I gotta headrush  
Tha sheep tremble an here come tha votes  
Thrown from tha throat, new cages and scapegoats  
One caution tha mics a detonator unwound  
Ta shut down tha devil sound  
Shut down tha devil sound  
Check tha heads bow in vietnow  
Shut down tha devil sound  
  
Is all tha world jails and churches?  
Is all tha world jails and churches?  
Is all tha world jails and churches?  
Is all tha world jails and churches?  
Is all tha world jails and churches?  
  
Radio, nah fuck it, turn it off  
Fear is your only god on tha radio  
Nah fuck it, turn it off  
Turn it off, turn on tha radio, nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on tha radio  
Nah fuck it, your savior's my guillotine, crosses and kerosene  
  
Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god  
Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god  
Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god  
Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god
