Ha  
Whatever will be,  
Will be  
  
Delete me from your friends,  
I don't care what you think,  
Let's forget we ever met,  
Don't cha worry 'bout me,  
  
So I'm sick to my stomach,  
When I'm think about the wasted time we spend togeth,  
Planning on forever,  
(Whatever)  
  
Cheat me once, shame on you,  
Cheat me twice, shame on me  
I'm an idiot,  
That I couldn't see what's underneath  
  
That beautiful face  
Or these warm or worse days  
Surprise, surprise  
I'm doing just fine  
(Whoa)  
  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
  
Whatever comes I'll be okay  
Whatever life Throws my way  
You wish I'd hurt,  
But I'm as free as a bird  
And I'm happier no-ow-ow-ow,  
(Yeah)  
  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA  
  
I could never go back  
To a thing that didn't last  
And I'm sorry to say  
That you're living in the past  
  
And if you'd ever believe  
I would take you back,  
It took you long to get in  
But now you're out so fast  
  
The way you played your cards  
Shoulda told me who you are  
Always goin' all in  
And you hated when I win  
  
Just had me whipped too far  
I shoulda known from the start  
That you gamble,  
  
With my heart  
  
  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
  
Whatever comes I'll be okay  
Whatever life throws my way  
You wish I'd hurt,  
But I'm as free as a bird  
And I'm happier no-ow-ow-ow  
  
Whoo,  
Ha Ha  
  
Ooooh I feel it in the air  
(Feel it in the air baby)  
Ooooh, there's something better out there  
Ooooh, Hello to the new me  
Ooooh So goodbye baby,  
(Goodbye)  
  
I could never go back  
To a thing that didn't last  
And I'm sorry to say,  
That you're living in the past  
  
And if you'd ever believe  
I would take you back  
It took you long to get in  
But now you're out so fast  
  
The way you played your cards  
Shoulda told me who you are  
Always goin' in all in  
And you hated when I win  
  
Just had me whipped too far  
I shoulda known from the start  
That you gamble,  
  
With my heart  
  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
Whatever comes I'll be okay  
Whatever life throws my way  
You wish I'd hurt,  
But I'm as free as a bird  
And I'm happier no-ow-ow-ow  
(Whoo)  
  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA, SERA  
Aaaah  
QUE SERA!
