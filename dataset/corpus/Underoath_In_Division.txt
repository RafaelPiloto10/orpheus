[I'm needing a better resistance.]  
Shading either side.  
I really wish I could, reset rewind.  
Someone has clawed out my eyes.  
Can't identify.  
I really wish I could reset rewind.  
You know it's never the way we planned it.  
I really wish we could, reset rewind.  
  
I'm planning a revolution inside my head!  
I'm planning a revolution, when I prevail  
I call for annihilation.  
Describe the sunlight so I can feel it's burn.  
If only I could give up with this plan  
  
I don't know what they told you,  
But this place is not what you think.  
Reset, Rewind!  
  
Living inside a hole, they put me underground.  
Where they can never find me unless they dig me out.  
  
I search for the answers, 'cause this is the end.  
I search for the answers!!  
  
God! It's caving in on me!  
I feel it watching!  
But no one seems to care anymore!  
Empty, I think of a way out!  
'Cause when I breathe in, there's no relief!  
  
I can't believe this, I can't believe this,  
My mind is starting to turn on me!  
  
I've been living inside a hole, they kept me underground.  
Where they can never find me unless they dig me out.  
I've been living inside a hole.  
Where they can never find me unless they dig me out.
