If there were no dreams  
And there were no dreamers  
And how could I dream you up  
You're still a mystery to me  
  
The way that we love  
The life that we're leading  
I don't want to give you up  
Whatever I'll have to do, I'll do  
  
Put a mountain there and I'll tear it down  
If it's much too high then I'll go around  
I won't stop for anyone or anything  
And I'd love you even if there were no dreams  
  
If there were no dreams  
How could we be lovers  
And how could I need you so  
The reason's clear to even me  
  
I know that it's right  
You don't need to wonder  
If you're up against that wall  
I'm gonna be up against it too  
  
If a mountain's there we can tear it down  
If it's much too high we'll just go around  
We won't stop for anyone or anything  
We'd be lovers even if there were no dreams  
  
Yes we would  
Lovers even if there were no dreams
