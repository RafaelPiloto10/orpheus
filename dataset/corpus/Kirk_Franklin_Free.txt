I know the pain you feel inside  
And the tears you try to hide  
In your heart you ask God why  
Can you help me, will you help me please  
Take away the pain  
Where's the sun I feel the rain.  
Then I hear your spirit say... That I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
Free  
Free to lift my hands  
Free to say Amen  
Free to know that someday I will smile again  
I'm free  
Free to laugh not cry  
Free to live not die  
Because of your love  
I'm free  
  
I know you're troubled by your past  
And you hide behind your mask  
The misery it seems to last  
Through the night but it's alright  
Joy is just a prayer away  
Don't look back at yesterday  
Then hear your spirit say  
That I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
Free  
Free to lift my hands  
Free to say Amen  
Free to know that someday I will smile again  
I'm free  
Free to laugh not cry  
Free to live not die  
Because of your love  
I'm Free  
  
No more chains and loneliness  
For Christ has set me free  
For we are more than conquerors  
Through his love now I can see  
That I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
Free  
Free to lift my hands  
Free to say Amen  
Free to know that someday I will smile again  
I'm free  
Free to laugh not cry  
Free to live not die  
Because of your love  
I'm Free
