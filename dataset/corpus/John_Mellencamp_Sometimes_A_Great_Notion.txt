Never give an inch - that's what I say, son.  
When it's too tough for everybody else,  
Hell, it's just right for me.  
Now my lips are bleeding  
From the selfish things that I've done,  
And my heart: it lies at the bottom of the ocean.  
Sometimes a great notion...  
  
Wanted to make love to my girl  
In the backseat of my car.  
So, I took her to the drive-in picture show.  
So, I filled her up with  
Lies and a strong love potion,  
And I'm sittin' here, watching the movie alone.  
Sometimes a great notion...  
  
Sometimes the best plans  
Have been known to go astray.  
So, you better put your seatbelt on.  
Just like your worst headache,  
Well, a bad day don't go away.  
And, you hit the ground running against your emotions.  
Sometimes a great notion...  
Sometimes a great notion...
