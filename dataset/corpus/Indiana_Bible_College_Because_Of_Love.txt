[Verse:]  
Because of love He left His throne and made this earth His home  
He did it willingly, for you and me, with heaven left behind  
He came to save all mankind, from sin and shame  
He could have walked away, but instead He chose to stay upon that tree  
And take a crown of thorns for me, because of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because of love He bore my pain, shouldering the blame  
Why did He choose to go, how could He love me so?  
Because of love He called to me, He said child I will set you free  
You will have life abundantly, because of love  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He gave unselfishly, caused my blinded eyes to see  
It was you and me He had in mind on the road to Calvary  
I never known such a perfect love I had fallen down but He picked me up  
He rescued my soul, now I want the world to know  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Because of love He left the grave, prepared for us a place  
He'll back again someday and I will hear Him say  
Because you believed, you'll live eternally  
And I'll fall on my knees and I will cry  
  
[Tag]  
You are holy, holy, Lord, God Almighty  
You are worthy, to receive glory  
Honor and power forever  
  
Amen  
  
Holy  
  
The angels bow down  
All creation cries out  
You're worthy of all the glory
