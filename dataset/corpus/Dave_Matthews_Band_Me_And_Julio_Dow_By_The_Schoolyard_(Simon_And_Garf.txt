Mama pyjama rolled outta bed, and go to the police station  
When my papa found out, he began to shout  
And started the investigation  
It was against the law, it was against the law  
What your mama saw, it was against the law  
  
Mama looks down and spits on the ground  
Every time my name gets mentioned  
And my papa said oy, if I ever get that boy  
I'm gonna stick him in the house of Detenton  
Said I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin  
Said I'm on my way, I'm takin my time, but I don't know where  
  
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
  
Well in a couple of days they're gonna take me away  
When the press let the story leak  
Now when the radical breach comes to get me released  
We all got on the cover of Newsweek  
Said I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin  
Said I'm on my way, I'm takin my time, but I don't know where  
  
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
  
Said I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'  
Said I'm on my way, I'm takin' my time, but I don't know where  
  
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard  
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
