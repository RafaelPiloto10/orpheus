Oh the sun beats down and melts the tar up on the roof  
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire-proof  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
[Chorus:]  
Under the boardwalk, out of the sun  
Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun  
Under the boardwalk, people walking above  
Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love  
Under the board-walk, board-walk  
  
From a park you hear the happy sounds from a carousel  
You can almost taste the hotdogs and french fries they sell  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be
