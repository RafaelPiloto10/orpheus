Happy birthday baby  
What's it gonna be  
Monday morning' with a hurricane warning'  
Oh well, I guess you've got yourself to please  
Jaded. Faded.  
I don't wanna be afraid.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be your slave.  
Saw you peeking' round my garden gate  
I thought you'd liked what you'd seen  
So I said, "Darlin' if you want a little of these peaches,  
Just come on and shake my tree. "  
Jaded. Faded.  
I don't wanna be your slave.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be afraid.  
Every waking' hour  
We break down in different combinations.  
We spin around in smaller constellations.  
Took a ride on the love wheel  
Scary, scary go-round and around.  
Honey, Honey I don't want none of your money.  
I just want off before we hit the ground.  
Jaded. Faded.  
I don't wanna be your friend.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be your slave.  
Saw you hangin' around the avenue baby  
So I got down outta my tree.  
I think I need a little animal honey.  
Come on and shake a little monkey with me.  
Jaded. Faded.  
Oh. I don't wanna be afraid.  
Jaded. I hate it.  
I don't wanna be your slave  
Every waking' hour  
We break down in smaller combinations.  
We spin around in different constellations.  
Wanna be right there to carry you away  
Knowing that our love will last through the day.  
It's the same thing.  
Gonna be here on the light, on the light  
I wanna see me, see me going away  
I've been gone such a long time.  
Leaving' again today.  
Leaving' someday.
