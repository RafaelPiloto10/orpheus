Different World  
  
Looking for an answer  
You've got to start somewhere  
Sooner or later  
Well you've got to show something  
I wasn't feeling too good  
This is all I have  
Would you take it from me?  
The future's uncertain, but I feel no pain  
It's a different world  
But the heat's the same  
Head to New York City  
Do you know my name?  
Know my name  
  
The places I'm needed  
What more could I ask for?  
Oh baby there's something  
One day I might get there  
  
Out of the red  
And into the blue  
You know there's something  
Burning deep inside you  
And now I'm doing so well  
Look at all I have  
Would you take it from me?  
The future's uncertain, but I feel no pain  
It's a different world  
But the heat's the same  
Head to New York City  
Yeah, you know my name  
Know my name  
  
It's a different jungle  
But the heat's the same  
Head to New York City  
Yeah, you know my name  
Know my name
