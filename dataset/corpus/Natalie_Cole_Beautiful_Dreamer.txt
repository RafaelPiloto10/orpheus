Beautiful dreamer, you are like magic to me  
'Cause you share all your love  
And your life and your love is so fine in my life  
It's just what I've been looking for  
Searching for and you care  
Beautiful dreamer, not an illusion to me  
You know I can tell by the way that you've taken my hand  
In a moment of sadness your gladness is there to surround me  
Astound me and you care  
  
I've seen all the people (waiting at the station)  
Waiting at the station  
(No imagination) no imagination  
They're too busy doing nothing  
Making all kinds of arrangements  
(Nothing's really) but nothing's really changing them  
(Changing them)  
  
They're (they're) still asking why (why) their well is dry  
I tried to tell them that love is the answer  
They need a beautiful dreamer  
If I could I'd share you with them  
Oh, but you know it took so very long to find what I've needed  
And my greatest obsession is doing my best  
Just to keep you and love you 'cause you care  
  
You're one in a million  
(Always giving into) always giving into  
(Me whenever I begin to) me whenever I begin to act  
A little like I'm crazy  
Still (still you never faulter) you never faulter  
(Never try to alter) or never try to alter my integrity  
How I could I not be proud to have your wisdom  
You're such a beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)  
  
You are like magic to me  
'Cause you share all your love  
And your life (and your life)  
And your love is so fine  
(So fine in my life) in my life  
And you know its just what I've been searching for  
Looking for and you care  
(Beautiful) beautiful dreamer (dreamer)
