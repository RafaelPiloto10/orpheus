Last chance lost,  
In the tyranny of a long good-bye  
Last chance lost,  
We talk of us with deadly earnest eyes  
Last chance lost,  
We talk of love in terms of sacrifice and compromise  
Last chance,  
Last chance lost  
  
Last chance lost,  
The hero cannot make the change  
Last chance lost,  
The shrew will not be tamed  
Last chance lost,  
They bicker on the rifle range  
Blame takes aim  
Last chance,  
Last chance lost
