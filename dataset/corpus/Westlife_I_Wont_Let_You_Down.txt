Bryan:  
Your life's hard enough  
And your not strong enough  
To be bleeding from your heart  
The strain has got to much  
I feel your losing touch  
You let your inner beauty slide  
And if I'm gone tomorrow  
Would you feel my sorrow?  
Don't you know that I'll be there?  
Till the bitter end  
Won't you be my baby coz  
Chorus:  
I won't let you down [I only want to be a part of you]  
No I won't let you down[Ill do everything you want me to]  
Ill never let you down[Each day I'm falling more in love with you]  
You don't know my mind  
But your on it all the time  
Mark:  
Must have been a fight  
To Keep your dreams alive  
When your as far into his wounds  
And if he's gone tomorrow  
I won't feel no sorrow  
Don't you know Ill bring you  
Woah a better ending  
To your helpless story because  
Chorus:  
I won't let you down [I only want to be a part of you]  
No I won't let you down[Ill do everything you want me to]  
I'll never let you down[Each day I'm falling more in love with you]  
You don't know my mind  
But your all the other time  
Mark:  
You don't know my mind  
But it don't make no difference  
Running all the time  
No no no  
No I'll never let you down  
No I'll never let you down  
Mark:  
And if he's gone tomorrow  
I won't feel no sorrow  
Don't you know Ill bring you  
Woah a better ending  
To your helpless story because  
Chorus:  
I won't let you down [I only want to be a part of you]  
No I won't let you down[Ill do everything you want me to]  
I won't let you down[Each day I'm falling more in love with you]  
Ill never let you down
