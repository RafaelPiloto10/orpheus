I've been thinking 'bout the times  
You walked out on me  
There were moments I'd believe, you were there  
Do I miss you, or am I lying to my self again  
I do these things...  
(It's all because of you)  
I keep holding on, but I'll try  
(try not to think of you)  
Love don't leave me lonely  
  
I'll be alright without you  
There'll be someone else...I keep tellin' myself  
I'll be alright without you  
Oh...love's an empty face, I can't replace  
(you don't need it)  
People wonderin' why we broke apart  
The great pretender here I go again  
These things I do  
(It's all because of you)  
I'll keep holdin' but I'll try  
(try not to think of you)  
All I wanted was to hold you  
  
I'll be alright without you  
There'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself  
I'll be alright without you  
Love's an empty face...Oh I've got to replace  
  
I'll be alright without you  
There'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself  
I'll be alright without you  
Oh...love's an empty place, I can still see your face  
I'll be alright
