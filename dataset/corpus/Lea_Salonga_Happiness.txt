Lea:  
You know some kids ask us what happiness really is.  
Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes.  
Well, what's your happiness, gerard?  
  
Gerard:  
My happiness is a hotdog sandwich, new rubber shoes, new t-shirts,  
New jeans and also my favorite part of happiness is love.  
  
Lea:  
Happiness is two kinds of ice cream  
Finding your skate key, telling the time  
Happiness is learning to whistle  
Tying your shoe for the very first time  
Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band  
And happiness is walking hand in hand  
  
Gerard:  
Happiness is five different crayons  
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree  
Happiness is finding a nickel  
Catching a firefly, setting him free  
Happiness is being alone every now and then  
And happiness is coming home again  
  
Lea:  
Happiness is morning and evening  
  
Gerard:  
Daytime and nighttime, too  
  
Both:  
For happiness is anyone and anything at all  
That's loved by you  
  
Gerard:  
Happiness is having a sister  
  
Lea:  
Sharing a sandwich  
  
Both:  
Getting along  
Happiness is singing together when day is through  
And happiness is those who sing with you  
  
Happiness is morning and evening  
Daytime and nighttime, too  
For happiness is anyone and anything at all  
That's loved by you
