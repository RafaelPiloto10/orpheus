(jack hues)  
Well I'm sitting on a hillside  
On the warmer side of cool  
With the future laid before me  
Like a green and misty jewel  
And to climb above the tree line  
Is only for the fools  
So they say  
So they say  
Chorus:  
On the warmer side of cool  
What you feel in your heart is all  
On the warmer side of cool  
Being cool it's so easy to be cold  
Well I'm sitting by the seaside  
On the warmer side of cool  
With the ocean spread before me  
Like a blue and misty jewel  
And if I jump into the water  
Would an angel break my fall  
So they say  
So they say  
On the warmer side of cool  
What you feel in your heart is all  
I'm sorry if I offend you  
If I'm a little bit intense  
But I never did intend us  
To be sitting on the fence  
And even though I'm guilty  
Of making total sense  
I'm happy when it's all  
On the warmer side of cool  
Repeat chorus  
It ain't cool to be cold
