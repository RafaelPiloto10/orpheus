Sometimes I could just  
Sometimes I could just  
Sometimes I can see you in motion  
Sometimes I can look straight through you  
Sometimes you stand beside me and  
Sometimes you are solo  
  
Sometimes I can see you in motion  
Sometimes I can look straight through you  
Sometimes you are so empty and  
Sometimes you are so cold  
Sometimes I can see you in motion  
Sometimes I can look straight through you
