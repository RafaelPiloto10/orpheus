When they gave out eyes like diamonds  
That would shame the stars that shine  
My darlin' my darlin'  
You were the first in line  
When they gave out lips like honey  
That hold a new thrill every time  
My darlin' my darlin'  
You were the first in line  
  
There may be others  
That know you longer  
Who pledge their hearts to you  
But there's no other  
Could love you stronger  
Any stronger than I do  
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me  
I am yours  
Oh, please be mine  
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'  
The first, and the last in line  
  
There may be others  
That know you longer  
Who pledge their hearts to you  
But there's no other  
Could love you stronger  
Any stronger than I do  
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me  
I am yours  
Oh, please be mine  
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'  
The first, and the last in line
