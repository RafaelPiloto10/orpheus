No one ever told me  
During all those tears I cried  
That one day you would hold me  
I just kept hoping inside  
  
True love was waiting  
True love would find me in time  
True love was waiting  
Your love would finally be mine  
  
No one ever showed me  
Such care and tenderness  
Baby you know me  
And what moves me the best  
  
It's true love waiting  
It's true love making up for lost time  
It's true love waiting  
Your love it's finally mine  
  
And I can't erase these lines on my face  
But I'd turn back time if I could  
But all the years wanting, the desperate longing,  
Are maybe what makes this so good  
  
True love, waiting  
True love that found us in time  
True love is waiting  
Your love is finally mine  
  
True love is waiting  
Your love is finally mine
