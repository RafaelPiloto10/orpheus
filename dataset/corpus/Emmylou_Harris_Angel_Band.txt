My latest sun is sinking fast, my race is nearly run  
My strongest trials now are past, my triumph has begun  
Oh, come angel band come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear my longing heart to him who bled and died for me  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin and gives me victory  
Oh, come angel band come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
