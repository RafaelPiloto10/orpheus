I taste your blood as it showers from my blade.  
I eat your heart, from evil it was made.  
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through  
my veins.  
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign.  
  
I conquer evil, let evil know my name.  
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain.  
I am the omen, the one that cannot die  
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.  
  
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED.  
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.  
  
I crush your bones, I kill your face  
I rip your flesh, I end the chase  
You meet with terror, you draw the ace  
I rule the world the rats that race.  
  
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED  
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.  
  
HATRED
