Feel my body breathing in  
Touch the softness of my skin  
I am very beautiful  
I can be so beautiful  
I am very beautiful  
I could be successful  
My hands are moving  
My feet are tied  
Watch the way my hair falls down  
See the way my hair falls down  
I am very beautiful  
I can be so beautiful  
Touch the softness of my skin  
Feel my body breathing in  
My hands are moving  
My feet are tied  
My eyes are closing  
My mouth is wide  
I will let you touch me  
If you want to touch me
