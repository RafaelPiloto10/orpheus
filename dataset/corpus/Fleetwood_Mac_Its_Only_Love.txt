I think I met my match again  
Passing 'round the candlelight  
In the center of this blizzard  
You stood and melted all the ice  
  
Ah, it's only love  
Ah, it's only love  
Ah, if only love comes round again  
It will have been  
Worth the ride  
  
You were master of so many  
But savior to none  
I waged all of my hopes so plenty  
On you... now look what I've become  
  
Ah, it's only love  
Ah, it's only love  
Ah, if only love comes round again  
It will have been  
Worth the ride  
What a ride  
  
Some days lonely is not only  
A word... but faces I have known  
And if you see me... could you free me  
With a smile... so I can let go  
  
Ah, it's only love  
Ah, it's only love  
Ah, if only love comes round again  
It will have been  
Worth the ride
