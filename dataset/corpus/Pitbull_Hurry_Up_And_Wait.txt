Hee's baaacckk!!  
To rip on this track, I'll rip any broad  
I don't care, white or black!  
Hee's baaacckk!  
If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worry  
Dog just hurry up and wait  
'cause I ain't Going no where anytime soon  
Sick what these rappers want to be?  
That's me, times 2  
Now...  
Get ready for me to take over this game  
I'm cutting the flow, like I'm cutting the cane  
Things will never be the same  
Pause...  
There's a lick for 50 bricks  
Now pause...  
And think about it  
Then pause...  
Is it really worth it?  
Then pause... pause...  
FUCK YEAH!!!  
I'm ready to go, jump in the ride  
Get the mask, get the gloves  
Cut off the lights, pop the gat  
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up  
But don't forget to pick up the prize  
And upgrade the ??  
If they don't give up the pies  
Now...  
I would hate to have to calm these boys down  
'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal...  
Why don't you just give us the keys and pounds  
Now Guess What He Said?  
[Chorus 2x]  
y'all want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!  
y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!  
y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!  
y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!  
I've been brought up  
By street cats who didn't get caught up  
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at the Carter  
I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a  
Little bit smarter!
