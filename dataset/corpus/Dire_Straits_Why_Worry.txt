Baby, I see this world has made you sad  
Some people can be bad  
The things they do the things they say  
  
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears  
I'll chase away those restless fears  
That turn your blue skies into gray  
  
Why worry  
There should be laughter after pain  
There should be sunshine after rain  
These things have always been the same  
So why worry now  
Why worry now  
  
Baby, when I get down I turn to you  
And you make sense of what I do  
And all the isn't hard is the same  
  
But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold  
Our love comes shinning red and gold  
And all the rest is by the way  
  
Why worry  
There should be laughter after pain  
There should be sunshine after rain  
These things have always been the same  
So why worry now  
Why worry now
