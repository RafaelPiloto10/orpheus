Chicken, chicken,  
You can't cluck too much for me.  
Chicken, chicken,  
Now come down off of that tree.  
Chicken, chicken, chicken,  
You can't cluck too much for me.  
  
"C" is for the little chick  
"H" for the momma hen  
"I" cause I love that bird  
"C" for the cluck, cluck  
"K" for the Kackle, Kackle  
"E" and the little "N"  
C-H-I-C-K-E-N  
That's the way to spell chicken  
That's my friend, the chicken.
