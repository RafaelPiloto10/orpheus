She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels at her command to send  
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend  
  
I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again  
  
She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure  
Carved by an artist who's hand is demure  
Got a mind like a saber  
Razor sharp and sure  
  
God how I hate myself for still wanting her  
  
Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure  
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her  
Nothing more but a heart still at war  
  
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels already sent  
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend
