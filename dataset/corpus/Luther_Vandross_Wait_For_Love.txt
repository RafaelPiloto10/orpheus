Knowing love the way I do  
I can say for certain that it's true  
There's a chance for me and you  
I surely feel like the time is near  
The picture in my mind is very clear  
I think love has brought us here  
  
I remember not too long ago  
I was just a lonely person with a lonely heart  
And I was hopin' there could one day be  
Be a chance for me to  
  
Get the love that I'd been missin'  
Sometimes love takes a long time  
Wait for love and you're gonna get the chance to love  
Wait for love, wait for love, oh my  
  
When you take the chance on love you see  
It's not a waste of time if you truly believe  
The impossible can be  
So hold on tight if you think you're right  
'Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see  
You gave up too easily  
  
I remember spending all my time  
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine  
And I was hopin' there could one day be  
A chance for me to  
  
I never stopped believing there could one day be  
Be a chance for me to
