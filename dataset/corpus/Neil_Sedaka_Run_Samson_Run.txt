In the bible, 1000 year bc  
There's a story of ancient history  
Bout a fella who was strong as he could be  
Till he met a cheatin gal who brought him tragedy  
Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way  
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay  
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start  
I'd rather trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin heart  
She was a demon, a devil in disguise  
He was taken by the angel in her eyes  
That lady barber was very well equipped  
You can bet your bottom dollar that he was gonna get clipped  
Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way  
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay  
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start  
I'd rather trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin heart  
Oh Delilah made Sammy's life a sin  
And he perished when the roof fell in  
There's a moral so listen to me pal  
There's a little of Delilah in each and every gal  
Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way  
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay  
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start  
I'd rather trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin heart  
I'd rather trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin heart
