She closed her eyes  
And let the walls of her prison fall away  
The walls that ached with a timeless wait  
They had become her walls of this modern tv life  
She closed her eyes  
And let them fall away  
And in her dreams she is standing by an ocean  
She is gazing out to sea  
She can remember with just a fleeting glimpse  
That she was once free  
So long ago now, so long it was as if it had never been  
Was it a holiday  
She thinks it could have been, ah yes, italy  
  
And he closes his eyes  
And he is gone far away  
Gone from all the confusion  
Gone from all the pain  
He can easily see what a pointless waste  
His modern life has become  
Chasing the gravy grain  
Chasing the dollar  
Chasing the clock  
Chasing his male friends  
Chasing the boss  
Chasing as it was everything  
It was nothing  
  
Only the sound of his own breathing was all he had  
At the end of the day  
And reasons to wonder, reasons to cry  
Too late for this selfish sinner who never asked why
