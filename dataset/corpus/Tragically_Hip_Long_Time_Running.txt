Does your mother tell you things?  
Long, long when I'm gone?  
Who you talking to?  
Is she telling you I'm the one?  
It's a grave mistake and I'm wide awake.  
  
Drive-In's rained out  
Weatherman wet-fingers the sky  
He pokes it out, he pulls it in  
He don't know why  
It's the same mistake  
  
It's been a long time running  
It's been a long time running  
It's well worth the wait  
  
We don't go anywhere  
Just on trips  
We haven't seen a thing  
We still don't know where it is  
It's a safe mistake  
  
It's been a long time running  
It's been a long time running  
  
Well, well it's all the same mistake  
Dead to rights and wide awake  
I'll drop a caribou, I'll tell on you  
I'll tell on you, I'll tell on you  
  
You've got a boat-load of nerve  
But I would say you've been told  
You work me against my friends  
And you'll get left out in the cold  
It's the same mistake  
  
It's been a long time running  
It's been a long time coming  
It's been a long, long, long time running  
It's well worth the wait  
It's well worth the wait  
It's well worth the wait  
It's well worth the wait
