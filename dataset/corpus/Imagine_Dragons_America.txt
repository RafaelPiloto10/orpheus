Is this just an illusion  
That I made inside my head to get me by?  
Twenty years in debt  
Twenty years in the government  
Twenty years can never get me by  
  
Then I feel you close  
Feel you close like you wanted me to  
Feel you close like you wanted me to  
Believe in you  
  
Rise to the top of the world, America  
America, don't you cry  
Lift me up  
Give me strength to press on  
Rise to the top of the world, America  
America, don't you cry  
Lift me up  
Give me strength to press on  
  
From farmers in the fields  
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise  
1-7-7-6  
The names upon the list  
For all the ones that gave until they died  
Don't you hold back  
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free  
  
And I feel you close  
Feel you close like you wanted me to  
Feel you close like you wanted me to  
Believe in you  
  
Rise to the top of the world, America  
America, don't you cry  
Lift me up  
Give me strength to press on  
Rise to the top of the world, America  
America, don't you cry  
Lift me up  
Give me strength to press on  
  
Rise to the top of the world, America  
America, don't you cry  
Lift me up  
Give me strength to press on  
Rise to the top of the world, America  
America, don't you cry  
Lift me up  
Give me strength to press on
