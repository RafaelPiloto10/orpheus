Mmm... mmm ... mmm, this dark lonely street  
Here am I, I walk alone, I have no love of my own  
Now each shadow I pass is my looking glass  
On this dark lonely street  
  
I'm in love with the dream, of a girl I've never seen  
Out of reach, out of sight, will I find her tonight  
On this dark lonely street  
Is my love just pretend, will this dream never end  
  
Maybe this cigarette, will help me to forget  
This dark lonely street  
Mmm... mmm... mmm, this dark lonely street
