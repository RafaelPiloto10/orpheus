If you want the sun.  
Then I'll be there to make it shine.  
Wherever you are going.  
  
I am the one.  
Can't you see my arms are open wide.  
Desire keeps on growing.  
  
No need for questions.  
I can see it in your eyes.  
I only need one answer.  
Where will you spend the night?  
  
(Is it gonna be)  
Your place or mine.  
We're gonna have a real good time my love.  
Together we can make it.  
Your place or mine.  
My love is the lasting kind so you  
Better come and take it.  
  
Do you feel the sun.  
Do you feel what I am feelin' now.  
We're meant to be together.  
  
You are the one  
With you I want to share my life.  
From now until forever.  
  
No need for questions  
I can see it in your eyes.  
I only need one answer.  
Where will we spend our lives?  
  
(Is it gonna be)  
Your place or mine.  
We're gonna have a real good time my love.  
Together we can make it.  
Your place or mine.  
My love is the lasting kind so you  
Better come and take it.  
  
(Is it gonna be)  
Your place or mine.  
We're gonna have a real good time my love.  
Together we can make it.  
Your place or mine.  
My love is the lasting kind so you  
Better come and take it.
