With Mr Soul or King Creole  
You gotta go with the man in the band  
He'll be your guide  
Singing la la la la  
But what makes Mr Politic  
A lot of words another trick  
Turn peace into war  
Singing ha ha ha ha  
  
Ooh it's not the way we want it  
Not the way at all  
Not the way to change our minds  
Our backs up against the wall  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
For life's a poem  
And we can make it rhyme  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
Let's get it together before we  
Go down, down, down  
I don't want to theorise it  
Just hope people realise  
The simple melody can free your soul  
And let you be man what you are  
And fly la la la  
But every back street slum where  
Pushers push and hookers hook  
Just won't set you free with ha ha ha ha  
Oooh it's not the way we want it  
Not the way at all  
Not the way to change our minds  
Our backs up against the wall  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
For life's a poem  
And we can make it rhyme  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
Let's get it together before we  
Go down, down, down  
Break  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
Oooh it's not the way we want it  
Not the way at all  
Not the way to change our minds  
Our backs up against the wall  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony
