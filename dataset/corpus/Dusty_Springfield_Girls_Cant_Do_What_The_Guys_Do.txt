Ooh, ooh  
Guys are gonna want to go out and play sometime  
But girls you must not let it get you down  
Just take this advice I give you  
Just like a mother  
You try to match a guy's independence  
You end up in the gutter  
  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
No, oh no  
  
And, listen girls when you give your heart away  
You can easily be hurt  
And the least little wrong he does  
Always seems like dirt  
So take this advice I give you  
Just like a mother  
You try to match a guy's independence  
You end up in the gutter  
  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
No, oh, no, mmm  
  
When you put your faith in one guy  
(Sometimes he'll make you happy)  
(Sometimes he'll make you cry)  
Don't lose your self-respect  
Tryin' to gain revenge  
'Cause no matter how you do it  
You lose out in the end  
  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no  
And still be a lady  
Girls, you can't do what the guys do, no
