Here is the beehive.  
(Hold fisted right hand outward.)  
  
Where are the bees?  
Hidden away where nobody sees.  
  
Soon they come buzzing  
Out of the hive...  
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!  
(Extend fingers, one at a time)  
  
Once I saw an anthill  
(Hold fisted left hand outward.)  
  
With no ants about  
So I said, "Oh, little ants,  
Won't you please come out? "  
  
And then as if by magic,  
It seemed they heard my call,  
'Cause One! Two! Three! Four! Five came out!  
(Extend fingers, one at a time)  
And that was all!
