If you want it to be good girl  
Get yourself a... Bad boy  
  
Yeah, I like this.  
  
If you want it to be wild  
Gotta know just who to dial baby  
(And that's me)  
If you really like it hot  
Get someone who hits the spot Honey  
(oh yes)  
  
Bridge  
And if you wanna get it done Then you gotta get the one  
The one who's got it goin' on  
Refrain  
If you wanna make it last Gotta know just who to ask  
Baby's gotta be the best  
And that's me  
  
Chorus  
If you want it to be good girl Get yourself a... Bad boy  
If you really want it good girl Get yourself a... Bad boy  
Get it like it could be  
Would be

Get yourself a... Bad boy  
  
If you like it innovative  
Better get someone creative Honey
