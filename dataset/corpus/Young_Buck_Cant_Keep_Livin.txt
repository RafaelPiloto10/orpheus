Life ain't 'posed to be like this, robbery and poverty  
24 hour shifts to keep this cocaine off of me  
Y'all ain't livin' how I'm livin', one mo' week I'm seein' prison  
'Cause to get what I'm after, a nigga might be missin'  
I ain't listenin' to shit, hit the Sweet and load the clip  
'Cause if crime didn't pay, then I'd be still on the strip  
You niggaz still runnin' yo' lips, I be runnin' them zips  
Up and down the interstate, makin' ten G's a trip  
A hardheaded nigga, do whatever it takes  
To go and get that bread nigga, heard what I said nigga?  
Been misled for a long time, waited in a long line  
Finally I'm here, now this rap game is mine  
Keep the herb burnin', ain't nuttin' changed 'cause I'm worth somethin'  
Y'all know the Young Buck, I'ma leave this earth bluntin'  
But still carry, the chrome Dirty Harry  
'Cause your boy got to have that, by any means necessary  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Ain't no nigga out here heaven-sent, not on these streets  
E'rybody want the Presidents 'cause niggaz gotta eat  
So I try to leave no evidence and come when you sleep  
In your residence nigga until my mission's complete  
Stay draped in my heat, paranoid like that  
You kill me? R.I.P. I got boys like that  
Who said they needed a white pack to strike back, shit  
Just give me the right mac and nigga I'll be right back  
Hardcore, and show these niggaz they don't want war  
You want more? Well gimme what I'm here for  
Y'all know I been raw, from day one  
This teenager with the big boys, gettin' the job done  
Got a daddy, but he ignored both of his sons  
Had to pay for my own way, as a child on the run  
I ain't scary, the AK-47, I married  
'Cause a nigga had to have that by any means necessary  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Look what y'all done to me, forced a nigga to this point  
Wouldn't feed me when I was hungry, I couldn't ignore it  
But I stay to my lonely, and didn't show it  
So when I killed you and your homies, you wouldn't know it  
Cristal I let you po' it while I fuck with the Hennessey  
All this time I'm the nigga that you pretend to be  
Tables done turned now I'm like remember me?  
The same lil' nigga you overcharged for a ki  
Times hard on a G, you was larger than me  
Young, but I ain't dumb, you ain't smarter than me  
Give niggaz a inch, and they takin' the whole mile  
So I hop out the 6, and I takin' they whole pile  
Uh-uh whoa now, how many niggaz see this grown child  
Shit gettin' hectic then you shut 'em down  
Tennessee to Uptown, niggaz is thuggin', mean muggin'  
Ain't no stoppin' I'm hot, and the game is what I'm lovin' nigga  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
All my nigga say  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Nigga  
Hey, I can't keep livin' this way  
'Bout to load up my fuckin' AK  
My mission is to go and get paid  
Get paid  
Get money nigga
