Tell me a secret  
I don't just wanna know about any secret of yours  
I wanna know about one special secret  
Because tonight I want to learn all about  
The secrets in your garden  
I wanna read your mind  
Know your deepest feelings  
I wanna make it right for you  
Baby, show me  
Let me share the mystery, oh  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Listen to your heart  
Tonight make it, alright  
Come on, come out tonight  
I know a melody that we could sing together  
I've got the secret key to you  
Let's make music, harmonizing ecstasy  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Sing it to me  
Here in the garden  
Where temptation feels so right  
Passion can make you fall  
For what you feel  
In the garden, we can make it come alive  
Every night oh, woman  
Your secret garden, oh oh  
Yeah, in the garden  
I need to be with you  
Let me lay beside you  
Do what you want me to all night  
Gonna hold you, ooh baby, can I touch you there  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
I can keep you satisfied, baby  
Come on, come on, come on, all night  
Oh we, oh we, baby  
Come on, come out tonight  
I'll take good care of you  
That's what a man's supposed to do  
And I'll be there for you all the time  
Let your hair down, let me get you in the mood  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Take me with you  
Into the garden  
Where the temptation feels so right  
Passion can make you fall  
For what you feel  
In the garden, we can make it come a live  
Every night, oh woman  
Here in your secret garden  
You know I've never wanted anyone  
I've never wanted anyone as much as I  
As much as I want you
