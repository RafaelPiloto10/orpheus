I got a maseratti two by two  
With snakeskin upholstery  
Charge account at goldblatz  
But I aint got you  
I got a closet full of clothes  
And no matter where I goes  
You keeps a ring in my nose  
But I aint got you  
I got a tavern, a liquor store  
I play the numbers, 444  
I got mojo don't you know  
Im all dressed up with no place to go  
I got women to the right of me  
I got women to the left of me  
I got women all around me  
But I aint got you, no I aint got you  
I got a tavern, and a liquor store  
I play the numbers, 444  
I got mojo don't you know  
But I aint got you  
No, I aint got you  
No, I aint got you  
No, I aint got you
