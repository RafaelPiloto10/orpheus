We had each other  
And we never knew how much we had  
Hurt one another  
'till we took the good and turned it bad  
  
But now we're so much wiser  
And we both know score  
Can we try just once more  
  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldn't fall in love again  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we couldn't give our all again  
If you miss me like I miss you  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldn't fall in love again  
  
Let's make it better  
Now that we can see where we went wrong  
Get back together  
In each other's arms we belong  
  
Let's put the past behind us  
We've both had time to heal  
So if you feel like I feel  
  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldn't fall in love again  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we couldn't give our all again  
If you miss me like I miss you  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldn't fall in love again  
  
If you need me like I need you  
Oh baby that's the one reason  
Why we ought to fall in love again  
  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldn't fall in love again  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we couldn't give our all again  
If you miss me like I miss you  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldn't fall in love again
