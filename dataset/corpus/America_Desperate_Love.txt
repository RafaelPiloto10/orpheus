Secret calls long after hours  
Suspicions rise, why does she whisper  
Someone's hiding something  
What's going on  
She smiles and finds an excuse to go out  
Meets him somewhere on the edge of town  
For one more night of real love  
How can it be wrong  
'Cause when they turn out the lights  
In their rented room tonight  
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
A cheater's conscience has no pride  
To spend the night with another man's wife  
Lie to his best friend and never think twice  
He knows where to find what he longs to have  
And do anything 'cause he wants her that bad  
Love has many faces, faces to hide  
'Cause when they turn out the lights  
In their rented room tonight  
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love (desperate love), risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love (desperate love), risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight ...
