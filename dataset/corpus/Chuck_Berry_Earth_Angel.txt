Earth Angel,  
Earth Angel,  
Will you be mine?  
My darling dear,  
Love you all the time.  
I'm just a fool,  
A fool in love with you.  
  
Earth Angel,  
Earth Angel,  
The one I adore,  
Love you forever  
And evermore.  
I'm just a fool,  
A fool in love with you.  
  
I fell for you  
And I knew  
The vision of your love, loveliness.  
I hope and I pray  
That someday  
I'll be the vision of your hap, happiness.  
  
Oh, Earth Angel,  
Earth Angel,  
Please be mine?  
My darling dear,  
Love you all the time.  
I'm just a fool,  
A fool in love with you.  
  
I fell for you  
And I knew  
The vision of your loveliness.  
I hope and pray  
That someday  
That I'll be the vision of your happiness.  
  
Oh, Earth Angel,  
Earth Angel,  
Please be mine?  
My darling dear,  
Love you all the time.  
I'm just a fool,  
A fool in love with you.
