I once was lost but You found me and now I'm free  
I need Your power to come and change me  
Your Spirit lives in me  
I wanna dance for all to see  
What compares to Your redeeming Love  
What can separate me from Your Love  
I need You in my life  
I'm never letting go  
Of all the things You've said  
I'm holding on 'cause You promised me that  
You'd never leave  
You're always by my side  
You'll never let me go  
So I'm holding on 'cause I know that I need You
