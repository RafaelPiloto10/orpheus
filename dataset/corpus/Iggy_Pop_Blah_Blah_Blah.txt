Pop before the war  
Lunch before the score  
Steady as she goes  
Following my nose  
I'm a bull mongrel  
That's me  
  
Shimon Peres  
Whatcha gonna do  
I'm from detroit  
Blow the reveille  
Deatho knocko  
That's me little ol'me  
Glamorous me  
  
Johnny can't read  
Blah blah blah  
I' can't see  
Blah blah blah  
Tuna on white  
Guns all night  
Blah blah blah  
  
Cat taboo girl-  
Raped by an ape  
Cat taboo girl  
Jam the sucker in  
You dig the mongrels  
Guardian of the state  
Says you gotta go  
Bombin' low  
  
Senator Rambo  
Merrily you go  
Monkey butcher knows  
A cab to find abank  
A bank to find a loan  
'cause you can't be alone  
You dig the mongrels  
  
Violent peace  
Blah blah blah  
Buy it right now  
Blah blah blah  
We are the world  
We are so huge  
Blah blah blah  
Johnny can't read  
Blah blah blah  
I' can't see  
Blah blah blah  
Tuna on white  
Guns all night  
Blah blah blah  
  
Blue jeans coolies  
Everything huge  
Petrified food  
Pizza killers  
From napalm to nice guy  
Nifty fifty  
Hit 'em where they live  
  
The most spoiled brats  
On god's green earth  
  
Pop before the war
