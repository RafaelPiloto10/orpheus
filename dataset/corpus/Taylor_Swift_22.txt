It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters  
And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh  
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight  
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh  
Yeah  
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time  
It's miserable and magical oh yeah  
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh oh  
  
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22  
Everything will be alright, if you keep me next to you  
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to  
Everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22  
  
It seems like one of those nights  
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids uh uh, uh uh  
It seems like one of those nights  
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping  
Yeah  
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way  
It's miserable and magical oh yeah  
Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh oh  
  
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22  
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you  
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to  
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh ah ah
