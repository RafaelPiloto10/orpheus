Hey! You! You too!  
I could make the choice for you.  
Just sticks close to you, it's all around me,  
Everything I try to do.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
But you think you're number 1, hey!  
Act as tho' them dinner's gone.  
  
You! Carried in a room for one. You too!  
Darkness when the lights are on.  
Turn me on for good, it's so exciting.  
Slogans on the wall don't need no underlining.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
Tackles you in fantasy. Hey!  
Hoping for some time to breathe.  
You! Some might get your corpse to easy. You too!  
I just want some time to breathe.  
Just sticks close to you, it's all around me.  
Everything I do, they're always trying to crowd me.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
Watching every move you make. Hey!  
Choice of one that's hard to take. You!  
In fact it's just a big mistake. You too!  
In fact they make it feel like you.  
Maggots swarm inside the line. Hey!  
Ready for the perfect crime.  
Say you there is no right or wrong. You too!  
I don't know what's right or wrong.  
I don't know what's right or wrong.
