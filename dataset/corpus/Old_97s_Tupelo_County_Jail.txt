Come on and write, write, write me a letter  
Send that letter by mail  
Send that letter in care of  
The Tupelo County Jail  
  
Wish me the best of luck, Dear  
There's no one here to my bail  
Never been a place so lonely  
As the Tupelo County Jail  
  
Fill that letter full a kisses  
I'm gonna have me a ball  
Baby, kisses on paper  
Are better than no kisses at all  
  
Come on and write, write, write me a letter  
Send that letter by mail  
Send that letter in care of  
The Tupelo County Jail  
  
(Take it Ken!)  
  
Fill that letter full a kisses  
I'm gonna have me a ball  
Baby, kisses on paper  
Are better than no kisses at all  
  
Come on and write, write, write me a letter  
Send that letter by mail  
Send that letter in care of  
The Tupelo County Jail  
The Tupelo County Jail  
The Tupelo County Jail  
The Tupelo County Jail...
