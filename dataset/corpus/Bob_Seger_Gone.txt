This gravestone is peaceful and quiet  
She pulls up a chair and sits right by it  
The air around is gentle and warm  
The rose colored wreath is tattered and torn  
  
Tiny blades of grass are peeking through  
Drawing life from sunshine and dew  
Remembering his eyes when she lied  
Knowing she lives feeling she's died  
  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone my child  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da  
  
So every night after sunshine  
You'll find her there alone in her shrine  
Two forms appearing ghostly in rain  
One red marble the other blue pain  
  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone my child  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da
