With the rhythm in our lovin'  
There ain't nothing I can do  
When I feel the beat of love  
Go on and on and on with you  
I don't have to worry  
There ain't nothing you won't do  
To give your love to me  
And I give my love to you  
  
I know what you like  
You know just what to do to me  
The rhythm is right  
We have fun with harmony  
You got the bass, I can pick up the pace, yeah  
There's no time to wait  
  
A perfect love is what you make of it  
When our bodies move we're syncopated  
I never knew that two could be  
Like you and me  
  
With the rhythm in our lovin'  
There ain't nothing I can do  
When I feel the beat of love  
Go on and on and on with you  
I don't have to worry  
There ain't nothing you won't do  
To give your love to me  
And I give my love to you  
  
So good together  
Some people work better solo  
But I could never  
Be without you oh no  
  
I'd muss you touch, as it is  
I can't get enough yeah  
I'm in heaven above  
I give you a melody that's always new  
You've got a good beat, I can dance to you  
Spinning for as long as we can  
Come on let's jam  
  
With the rhythm in our lovin'  
There ain't nothing I can do  
When I feel the beat of love  
Go on and on and on with you  
I don't have to worry  
There ain't nothing you won't do  
To give your love to me  
And I give my love to you  
  
With the rhythm in our lovin'  
There ain't nothing I can do  
When I feel the beat of love  
Go on and on and on with you  
I don't have to worry  
There ain't nothing you won't do  
To give your love to me  
And I give my love to you  
  
Le beat de jour c'est le beat d'amour  
With the rhythm in our lovin'  
There ain't nothing I can do  
When I feel the beat of love  
Go on and on and on with you  
I don't have to worry  
There ain't nothing you won't do  
To give your love to me  
And I give my love to you
