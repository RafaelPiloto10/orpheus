I see that guy that you're standing near  
I know yu think that he's fine  
He gets you hot with his dancing gear  
But you ain't had none of mine  
  
Oh I like the way you move  
I'd like to feel your groove  
He'll never do you like me  
I got the stuff you need  
  
Oh, danse pour ton amour  
I'm dancing for your love  
Je danse pour ton amour  
Dancing for your love tonight  
  
I saw you looking like you wanted some  
And you were looking at me  
If you want to party and have some fun  
(Then) I'm the guy you should see  
  
I, I got the stuff to soothe  
I like the way you move  
You got the power to be  
Everything that I need
