First Verse  
I'm home alone again  
And you're out, hanging with your friends  
So you say, but I know it's not quite that way  
It's getting pretty late and you haven't checked on me all day  
When I called you didn't answer  
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me, tight in your arms  
And I wish, I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So you couldn't hurt me  
It just ain't fair the way you treat me  
No you don't deserve me  
Wasted my time thinking about you and you ain't never gone change  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So I wouldn't feel this way  
  
Verse 2  
When you touch me my heart melts  
And everything you did wrong I forgive  
So you play me and take advantage  
Of the love that I feel for you  
Why you wanna hurt me so bad  
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad  
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and its hard for me to even look at you  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me tight in your arms ooh baby  
I wish I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Bridge  
Said you care about me, but from what I see  
I ain't feeling that, so I disagree  
Gave you all my love and understanding and you treated me like your enemy  
So leave me alone, don't want nothing from you  
Just go back where you came from this house is no longer your home  
You you are not welcome no more  
  
Chorus (repeat 2x)  
  
Outro  
I hear you knocking at my door again  
I'm wondering should I let you in  
I open up the door and see the flowers for me  
So beautiful in your hands  
You start begging me to take you back,  
I've always been a sucker for romance  
And before you know it I can see, you're all over me  
Oh no here I go again  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you so you couldn't hurt me
