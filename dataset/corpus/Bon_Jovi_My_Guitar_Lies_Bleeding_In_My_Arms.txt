Misery likes company I like the way that sounds  
I've been trying to find the meaning  
So I can write it down  
Staring out the window it's such a long way down  
I'd like to jump but I'm afraid to hit the ground  
  
I can't write a love song the way I fell today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Since you went away  
I sing this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
I'm tired of watching TV it makes me want to scream  
Outside the world is burning  
Man it's so hard to believe  
Each day you know you're dying  
From the cradle to the grave  
I get so numb sometimes that I just feel the pain  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Strange enough these days  
I send this song to you whoever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
Staring at the paper I don't know what to write  
I'll have my cigarette-well, turn out the lights  
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way  
But here in my delusion I don't know what to say  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
And I can't fight the feelings  
That are burning in my veins  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
There's no one left to save  
And I can't fight the feelings buried in my brains  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
