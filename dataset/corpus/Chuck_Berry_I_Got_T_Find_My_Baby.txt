I'm gonna search this town  
From door to door  
The love I crave  
I can't find no more  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare I wouldn't no lie  
I ain't had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye.  
  
You know I hate to see the sun  
Hurry to the west  
'Cos I know my whole life's  
Will be one solid mess.  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare that ain't no lie  
I ain't had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye.  
  
Yesl, ever since the day  
That she said we were through  
I've been nervous  
And shook up too.  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare I wouldn't no lie  
I ain't had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye.  
  
Yesl, I don't care if it's the last thing  
I ever do in my life  
I'm gonna find that little girl  
Make her my wife.  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare I wouldn't no lie  
I ain't had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye.
