We knew it must have been late  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
We had no time to wait  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I went to light the fireplace  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I planned it all this way  
And  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
  
I snuggled close to her  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
Her heart began to purr  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I held my breath inside  
And then  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I put my arms around her  
(Tick-tock)  
  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo  
  
I put that birdie away  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
His cuckoo was gone to stay  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
We both apologized for why  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
Forgave that doggone cuckoo  
  
I went back to her side  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I had to swallow my pride  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
The fire had almost died away  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
We just got situated  
(Tick-tock)  
  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo  
  
I took that clock apart  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
I broke the cuckoo's heart  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
He'll never bother us again  
(Tick-tock  
Tick-tock)  
We just forgot about him  
(Tick-tock)  
  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo (go away silly bird)  
Cuckoo  
Cuckoo
