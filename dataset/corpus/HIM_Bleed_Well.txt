You had demons to kill within you screaming  
With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes  
  
Love preys the living and praises the dead  
In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed  
  
Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged  
Kiss and tell, baby we're bleeding well  
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail for reasons insane  
Kill and tell, baby we're bleeding well'  
'In hell  
  
'No love lost under her will', I heard you weeping  
And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in  
  
If death is the answer to love's mysteries  
Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream
