Goin' down to Rosie's  
Stop at Fanny May's  
Gonna tell Fanny what I heard her boyfriend say  
Now don't you start me talkin'  
I'll tell everything I know  
I'm gonna break up this signifyin'  
'Cause somebody gotta go  
Jack gave his wife two dollar  
Go down to the market  
Get out on the street, ol' George stopped her  
He knocked her down  
And blacked her eye  
She get back home and tell her husband a lie  
Now don't you start me talkin'  
I'll tell everything I know  
I'm gonna break up this signifyin'  
'Cause somebody gotta go  
She borrowed some money  
To go to the beauty shop  
"I'm goin' to a place where I can get my hair sot"  
Now don't you start me talkin'  
I'll tell everything I know  
I'm gonna break up this signifyin'  
'Cause somebody gotta go
