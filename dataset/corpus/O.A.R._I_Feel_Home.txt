There are few things pure in this world anymore,  
And home is one of the few.  
We'd have a drink outside,  
Maybe run and hide if we saw a couple men in blue.  
  
To me it's so damn easy to see  
That true people are the people at home.  
Well, I've been away but now I'm back today,  
And there ain't a place I'd rather go.  
  
I feel home,  
When I see the faces that remember my own.  
I feel home,  
When I'm chillin outside with the people I know.  
  
I feel home,  
And that's just what I feel.  
Home is reality,  
And all I need is something real.  
  
Feelin alright, headin out tonight,  
Maybe out to a dark driveway.  
I say now some feel bored,  
And some are lookin for more.  
  
Well, we all just decide to stay.  
We got nothin to do,  
And I look at you  
I see something that I know and love.  
  
And with the crack of a smile we all stay a while  
We know from home there ain't nothing above.  
Well in the end we can all call a friend  
Well that's something I know as true.  
  
And then a thousand years and a thousand tears  
I come to findingin(something's wrong here) my original crew  
'Cause to me throughout eternity  
There's somewhere where you're welcome to go  
  
I said it's something free that means a lot to me  
When I'm with my friends I feel home.  
I feel home,  
When I see the faces I remember my own  
  
I feel home,  
When I'm chillin outside with the people I know.  
I feel home,  
And that's just what I feel.  
  
Home is reality,  
And all I need something real  
Home is reality,  
And all I need something real  
I feel home.
