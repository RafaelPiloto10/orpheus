[Chorus]  
Darkman  
V-Ice  
Trust me ain't nothing nice  
Hardcore  
My dog's unbreakable like dice  
Hardcore  
My dog's unbreakable like dice  
Hardcore  
My dog's unbreakable like dice  
  
[Verse 1: La the Darkman]  
I've been in bloody pictures  
Ill as Hitler back in Germany  
Kid's think they're burning me  
You really ain't concerning me  
King be hold a Mack 8 plus 3  
And I draw rhymes fast as Zorro draw that Z  
Draw guns - fast as white boys on TV  
You can't fuck with me! Trapper conti  
Warfare my clan specialize in putting cats in  
wheelchairs  
Pack a .38 Snubnose name brand clothes  
What's money to my clan was death to my foes  
That's how it goes, My Niggaz is gung-ho  
God advocates sniping weak rappers with a crossbow  
Stay on the low with a M-16 flow  
In the Benz with a dime bitch, puffin hydro  
I'm CEO you're TKO, John Doe  
My raps is like cheap keys straight from Mexico  
Yo, I flow like a UFO, All-Pro  
Rich kid, get my dick sucked in a Tahoe  
When I hear a beat it's like putting tims on my feet  
Then run a track meet away from the beats, fuck police  
I run the street with a Mack Milli for rappers who act silly  
Cock it back, then smoke a Nigga like a Philly  
  
[Chorus] - repeat  
[Verse 2: Vanilla Ice]  
I draw my rhymes like a bow  
Shoot 'em out like an arrow  
Swooping on suckers like an eagle, not a sparrow  
walk a wide path, never ever walk it narrow  
Step on stage with funky hip-hop apparel  
Got the funky rhymes sometimes they leave you scared bro  
It's like looking down a shotgun barrel  
Hardcore  
Runs through my veins like cocaine  
V-Ice, In your brains like bloodstains  
Psycho!  
When I step to the mic, bro  
You know the Ice'll do it right, what I'm saying is "Yo"  
Suckers fronting what you wantin is for me to fade!  
Thought I was outta here, I ain't going away!  
Back with the track, I keep my bank fat  
You know I got the flavor for the funky format  
You're not giving up, the credit I seek  
Darkman's in the house he's ready to creep  
Now what you gonna do  
When my boys are on you  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
Now crank it up for your passenger - LOUDER  
Cause it's the thrilla killa, I bring this hardcore hour  
  
[Chorus] - repeat  
[Chorus] - repeat
