You are a loser just like I was  
You are a loser like the rest of your friends  
You're a loser in the worst way  
I think you're losing just to make up  
  
Yeah I've seen the light  
All around your face  
  
I see you dying in the highway  
I see you climbing up the hill  
I see your sunshine on your blond hair  
I see you worshiping the thrill  
  
Yeah I've seen the light  
All around your face  
Yeah I've seen the light  
Shine in your eyes  
Yeah I've seen the light  
Light from another place  
Now I know its not real  
Yes I know it's not real...  
Yes I know it's not  
  
Yeah I've seen the light  
All around your face  
Yeah I've seen the light  
Shine in your eyes  
Yeah I've seen the light  
From another place  
Now I know it's not real...
