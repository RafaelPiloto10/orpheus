Like a vision flying round this room  
I did feel sure as my time too  
I've been inside your mind in outer space  
  
I feel the city crying, beg for more  
Threw a key chain across your floor  
A soul destroying motion holds your face  
  
Can you feel it?  
Do you want it?  
Do you get it?  
It's your last chance  
It's the last dance  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little of my love boy  
C'mon baby take my love  
Take my love  
  
A little party let's go deep  
Set your dream free fall at my feet  
I'm falling for you baby like a charm  
  
I never knew that life could be so sweet  
So unusual so complete  
I'm falling like a baby in your arms  
  
Can you feel it?  
Do you want it?  
Do you get it?  
It's your last chance  
It's the last dance  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little of my love boy  
C'mon baby take my love  
Taste my love  
  
Feel it?  
Want it?  
Get it?  
It's your last chance  
It's the last dance  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little of my love boy  
C'mon baby taste my love  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little love my love boy  
C'mon baby taste my love  
Take my love
