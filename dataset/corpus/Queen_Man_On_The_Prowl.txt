Oh yeah  
I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side  
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas  
I'm gonna get me some action  
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane  
My baby left me alone  
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely  
So come home, come home  
If you don't you're gonna break my heart  
  
Man on the prowl  
You better watch out  
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble  
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)  
I'm a man on the prowl  
  
I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady  
I just wanna be low down trash  
I wanna go to the movies  
All I wanna do is sit on my ass - ooh  
So honey come home (come home come home)  
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely  
Come home (yeah yeah) - come home (yeah yeah)  
If you don't you're gonna break my heart  
  
Man on the prowl  
You better watch out  
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble  
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)  
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl  
  
Well I keep dreaming about my baby  
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere  
(Bap bap) hey  
I gonna teach my baby dancin'  
(Bap bap)  
But I ain't no Fred Astaire  
  
So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl  
Look out - man on the prowl - yeah  
Yeah - baby, baby, baby look out, yeah - man on the prowl  
  
Baby come home  
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble  
Baby come home - oh yeah  
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl  
So honey come home - come home  
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah  
Man on the prowl - yeah  
Hey, stay with it  
Loosen up  
Wooh yep ha wooh ha  
Yeah
