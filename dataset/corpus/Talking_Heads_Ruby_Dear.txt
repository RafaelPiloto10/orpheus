'Round and 'round  
And we won't let go  
And where we stop  
No one knows  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Down and down  
In a spin we turn  
Looking like  
We'll never learn  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Think about  
What ev'ryone is saying  
Ruby dear  
Oh don't you hear  
  
Late at night  
When the radio is playing  
Ruby dear  
So looky here  
  
Oh this record's broken  
It slips a beat  
And all those watermelons  
Have gone to seed  
  
Nothing lives  
In this dirty little river  
No one here  
Will shed a tear  
  
It dried up  
But it couldn't run forever  
Ruby dear  
That's what we hear  
  
I still like the ocean  
Down by the sea  
They left that door wide open  
It tempted me  
Hounding me  
From the bedroom to the kitchen  
  
Ruby dear  
I'm still right here  
Now they threw  
The fox amongst the chickens  
It's too deep  
I'll drown in my sleep!  
  
Angels and prostitutes  
They might look the same  
And if to Hell we're going  
I'll see you there  
  
'Round and 'round  
And we won't let go  
And where we stop  
No one knows  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Down the street  
Where the bonfires glow  
Looking like  
They lost control  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Settle down  
In that rocking chair  
Breathing in  
That rotten air  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Johnny Jones  
Fell fast asleep  
Down a hole  
Where the rocks are steep  
Uh-huh uh-huh
