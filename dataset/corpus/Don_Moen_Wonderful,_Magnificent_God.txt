Verse 1:  
At Your feet I bow  
There is none like You  
For all that I have found  
All I want is You  
For all the wonders You do  
And all that You are  
What I can bring to You  
I offer my heart

Wonderful magnificent God  
I'm humbled by the life You gave  
Beautiful Redeemer You are  
Worthy of my highest praise

What can we give to You o God  
For everything You have given to us  
We offer our lives to You o God  
For everything You have given to us  
We offer our lives to You o God  
For everything You have given to us  
We offer our lives to You o God  
For everything You have given to us
