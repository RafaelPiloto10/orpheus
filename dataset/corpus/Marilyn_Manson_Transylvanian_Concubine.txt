If you want to know how  
To fly high, then go now  
To the place where all the concubines...  
  
Meet and converse with them  
Marvel at their pale skin  
Wonder how they chew on their pointy...  
  
Teeth and hair are beauty  
They know it's their duty  
To be countess in their hearts and their...  
  
Minds that have to whisper  
See in them a sister  
Look into their eyes and you'll become  
  
Transylvanian Concubine.  
You know what flows here like wine.  
Stay here with us, it's just time.  
Transylvanian Concubine.  
  
Sorrow is their master  
Cackling with laughter  
Now he's having just one piece of...  
  
Cakey is their make-up  
Catholics try to shake up  
All the things that form their lives, but they're...  
  
Dead, their sighs, their songs  
They know what they do is wrong.  
Stay here with us, it's just time.  
Transylvanian Concubine.  
  
Candelabra's lighted  
Satan has been sighted  
Never has there been an evening like...  
  
This is what they wanted  
Always to feel hunted  
You can never be too rich or too...  
  
Thin. The blood has run out.  
Fangs ruin any cute pout  
Morning has come now they've flown  
What have you learned from what has been shown?
