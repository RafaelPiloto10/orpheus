If you leave me  
I won't miss you  
And I won't ever take you back  
Girl your memory  
Won't ever haunt me  
Cause I don't love you  
Now if you'll buy that  
  
[Chorus]  
I got some ocean front property in Arizona  
From my front porch you can see the sea  
I got some ocean front property in Arizona  
If you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free  
  
I don't worship  
The ground you walk on  
I never have and that's a fact  
I won't follow or try to find you  
Cause I don't love you  
Now if you'll buy that  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah if you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free
