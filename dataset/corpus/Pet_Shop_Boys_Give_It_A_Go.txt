Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Give it a go, why don't you choose me?  
Say it's not so that you rather lose me  
If you're disposed to say forget it  
You don't suppose you might regret it  
  
Give it a go, let's make our break now  
Don't look down your nose, or so I'll pick now  
For all we know, there's not much time left  
If you give me a no, you leave me be runt  
  
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better  
Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go, give it a go  
  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Taken away, shed all I've got now  
Catch the bouquet, let's tie the knots down  
A beautiful day you're smile has crowned  
If you're looking for love I think you found it  
  
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better  
Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go,  
You could be aiming for a cool time, you know  
A real twin set up hello  
But in the meantime, why not give me a go, give me a go  
  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better  
Oh no, but in the meantime, why not give it a go,  
You could be aiming for a cool time, you know  
A real twin set up hello  
But in the meantime, why not give me a go, give me a go  
  
Give it a go, give it a go
