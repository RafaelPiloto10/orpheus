Boy, we've had a real' good time  
And I wish you the best on your way  
Eh eh  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
I never thought we'd fall out of place  
Eh eh, Eh eh  
  
I have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keeping telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
  
And babe, there's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
There's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
I wish you'd never looked at me that way  
Eh eh, eh eh

I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
Don't play too much just as that kid  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
  
Let's play a love game, baby love game  
When you want love, when you want fame  
Though you in a game, though in a love game  
Let's play a love game, baby love game  
When you want love, when you want fame  
Though you in a game, though in a love game
