Is there a remedy for the passions of the soul  
Brother if there is one I don't really know  
Have I let my imagination run out of control  
I'm a rainbow  
Just a rainbow  
  
Am I living here in this nameless state  
It's light on darkness sound of silence  
I just can't get it straight  
See I don't wanna be no one that I ain't  
I'm a rainbow  
Just a rainbow  
  
And all the colors that you see  
Are all part of me  
In this crazy world of mine  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow  
Ever changing all the time  
I'm a rainbow colorful rainbow  
Sometimes I shine  
  
And all the colors that you see  
Are all part of me  
In this crazy world of mine  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
Da, da, da ,da,da  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow  
And sometimes I can shine  
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow
