Take me to heaven  
On this cold norwegian night  
My skin is unleaven  
Untouched and so unsanctified  
Feel the flame that burns my pegan soul  
  
This sacred ingression  
Is a sooth-said rhapsody  
This carnel connection  
Ignites my flesh with fantasy  
  
A holocaust of love is rising now  
Feel the fire  
You inspire  
Mesmerizer  
Take me to the valleys of valhalla  
  
A holocaust of love is rising now  
Feel the fire  
You inspire  
Mesmerizer  
Take me to the valleys of valhalla
