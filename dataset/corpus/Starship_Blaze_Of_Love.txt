We are running out of time  
We've got one foot on the rock, and one foot over the line  
This love, this love's not turning back  
Well I don't know about you, but me I'm following that  
  
Late at night, watching you sleep, and I know inside, I'm over the edge  
  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
  
Oh you, you can run away  
You can shatter my world, scatter my dreams all over the place  
But I, I've grown to love these chains  
You can tear 'em apart but I don't want to escape  
  
I close my eyes, picture your smile and I know inside, I'm over the edge  
  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
I'm goin' down, down, down, in a blaze of love, blaze of love  
Blaze of love  
Blaze of love  
  
Oh, I'm over the edge...in a blaze of love  
  
(Down, down, down, blaze of love) Blaze of love  
(Down, down, down) In a blaze of love, in a blaze of love  
I'm goin down, down, down, down, down, down  
In a blaze of love (Blaze of love)  
Down, down, down, in a blaze of love...
