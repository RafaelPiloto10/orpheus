I was dancing with a dirty blond Texan  
Charming accent but the music's playing too loud for talking  
So I showed him how people in the Far East get down  
  
Push it up, push it down  
Pull it up, pull it down  
Keep it up, keep it down  
Now put me down  
What a workout!  
  
If you want, you can come  
Come get it, get it  
If you don't you may really regret it, 'gret it  
Up and down till your knees start shakin' shakin'  
ain't it good to be alive tonight  
  
One life, two-time, three girls, four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
6.0 Make it sweet, drop another dime  
  
I was talking with a born-again Christian  
"So what's it like to start life all over?"  
He sad "Amen,  
I feel like I've been rediscovering the tomb of Tutankhamen."  
  
Push it up, push it down  
Pull it up, pull it down  
Baby, don't put me down  
What a workout!  
  
What you want, it's a done deal  
Shake it, shake it  
What you don't, you can forget about it, 'bout it  
Up and down, feel your brainwaves jumpin' jumpin'  
Makes me want to take a dive  
  
As we count to five  
  
One life, two-time, three girls, four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
  
Can you hold on, someone's calling on the other line  
  
Push it up, push it down  
Pull it up, pull it down  
Keep it up, keep it down  
Now put me down  
What a workout!  
  
If you want, you can come  
Come get it, get it  
If you don't you may really regret it, 'gret it  
Up and down till your knees start shakin' shakin'  
Ain't it good to be alive tonight  
  
One life, two-time, three girls, four guys  
Five ripples running up and down my spine  
6.0 Make it sweet, drop another dime
