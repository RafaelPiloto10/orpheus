It went right by me  
At the time it went over my head  
I was looking out the window  
I should have looked  
At your face instead  
  
It went right by me  
Just another wall  
There should have been a moment  
When we let our barriers fall  
I never meant  
What you're thinking  
That is not what I meant at all...  
  
Well I guess we all  
Have these feelings  
We can't leave unreconciled  
Some of them burned on our ceilings  
Some of them learned as a child  
  
The things that we're concealing  
Will never let us grow  
Time will do its healing  
You've got to let it go  
  
Closed for my protection  
Open to your scorn  
Between these two directions  
My heart is sometimes torn  
  
I lie awake with my secrets  
Spinning around my head  
Something that somehow  
Escaped me  
Something you shouldn't have said  
I was looking out the window  
I should have looked  
At your face instead...  
  
I find no absolution  
In my rational point of view  
Maybe some things are instinctive  
But there's one thing you could do  
You could try to understand me  
I could try to understand you...
