Oh, mountain of our eyes, what do you see?  
The girl with the omen dice, bowing to thee  
Mortal soldiers clear the path, shake the omen tree  
Oh, mountain of our eyes, oh plea  
Oh, hear our plea  
  
See the five fingers laid, like a hand in blue  
In sideways of the pure  
Together glimpse of you, together glimpse of you  
The great lake, the white shoot  
Your white mind, mind  
Whoa, mountain of mine  
Whoa, Fuji-san, for a planning  
Into the blue, into the great mist  
Into the bright, into your light  
  
Oh, mountain of our eyes, we're calling you  
Will you hear our cries, what will the poor boy do?  
What will the poor girl do?  
We're coming to you  
Whoa, Fuji-san  
Whoa, mountain of our eyes, what do you see?  
The girl with the omen dice, shaking the tree  
Shaking the omen tree
