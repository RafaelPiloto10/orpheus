I hear your heartbeat but you're never there  
Like a mirage, you haunt me everywhere  
All day long  
I burn for you, lonely in the night  
I tried to live alone, but I just can't get it right  
Ya' know that, this town's like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat, movin' in the city  
I'm lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
  
I've done some thinkin', now that you're not here  
I know your reasons, and they're still not clear  
All I'm sure of is what I got to lose  
I tried to be a better loser, but it's just no use  
  
Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat, movin' in the city  
I'm lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
  
Walkin' in the sundown, I search in vain  
Waitin' on the wind that whispers out your name  
Through concrete canyons echoing a world of other faces  
No direction looks like home  
Where is my oasis?  
  
Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat, movin' in the city  
I'm lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
In a Painted Desert without you  
Where is my oasis?
