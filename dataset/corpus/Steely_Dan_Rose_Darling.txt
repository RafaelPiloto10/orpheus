Rose darling come to me  
Snake Mary's gone to bed  
All our steaming sounds of love  
Cannot disturb her in her night  
  
Or raise her sleeping head  
All I ask of you  
Is make my wildest dreams come true  
No one sees and no one knows  
  
Rose darling come to me  
Snake Mary dreams along  
I would guess she's in Detroit  
With lots of money in the bank  
  
Although I could be wrong  
You must know it's right  
The spoor is on the wind tonight  
You won't feel it till it grows  
  
[Chorus]  
Rose darling my friend  
With only you and what I've found  
We'll wear the weary hours down  
  
Rose darling come to me  
The clock is close at hand  
All my empty words of love  
Can never screen the flash I feel  
  
Or make you understand  
Honey can't you see  
I know it's real it's got to be  
Why not chase it where it goes  
  
[Chorus]
