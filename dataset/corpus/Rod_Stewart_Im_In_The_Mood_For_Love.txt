(Wilmott, Mchugh and Fields)  
  
I'm in the mood for love  
Simply because you're near me  
Funny, but when you're near me  
I'm in the mood for love  
Heaven is in your eyes  
Bright as the stars we're under  
Oh, is it any wonder  
That I'm in the mood for love?  
Why stop to think of whether  
This little dream might fade?  
We've put our hearts together  
Now we are one, I'm not afraid  
And if there's a cloud above  
If it should rain, we'll let it  
But for tonight forget it  
I'm in the mood for love  
Oh yeah  
  
Why stop to think of whether  
This little dream might fade?  
We've put our hearts together  
Now we are one, I'm not afraid  
And if there's a cloud above  
If it should rain, we'll let it  
But, for tonight, forget it  
Cause I'm in the mood for love  
I'm in the mood for love  
For love, for love...
