America Will Always Stand  
Randy Travis  
Album :America Will Always Stand  
She stands in the face of evil  
And will not lose hope or faith  
America, the land of freedom  
Still the home of the brave.  
Chorus:  
So raise the banner, called Old Glory  
Let us join our fellow man  
History will write the story,  
America will always stand.  
Walking through the fires of danger  
There are those who gave their lives  
They're the world's greatest heroes,  
And we won't forget their sacrifice.  
(Chorus):  
So raise the banner, called Old Glory  
Let us join our fellow man  
History will write the story,  
America will always stand.  
America is not divided  
Our enemies they will be stopped.  
'Cause, we the people are united  
And still, one nation Under God.  
(Chorus):  
So raise the banner, called Old Glory  
Let us join our fellow man  
History will write the story,  
America will always stand  
History will write the story,  
America will always stand...
