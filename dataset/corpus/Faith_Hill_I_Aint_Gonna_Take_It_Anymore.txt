You've worn the soles of both your shoes  
Walkin' on me like ya do.  
This ain't what forever's for,  
And I ain't gonna take it,  
  
I ain't gonna take it anymore.  
I've cried and begged and cursed and prayed  
But nothing's worked, nothing's changed.  
No way I win when you keep score,  
  
And I ain't gonna take it,  
I ain't gonna take it anymore.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna crawl out from this stone  
That I've been under  
To see the light and breathe the air  
And you'll have a million reasons why  
I shouldn't leave you.  
But for the first time in a long time,  
I don't care.  
  
I guess on one hand you should laugh  
'cause I've said the same things in the past  
But this time one hand's on the door  
And I ain't gonna take it,  
I ain't gonna take it anymore.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I can't help but think of you  
Lookin' back in my rear view  
But I've been down that road before  
And I ain't gonna take it,  
  
I ain't gonna take it anymore.  
I ain't gonna take it,  
I ain't gonna take it anymore.
