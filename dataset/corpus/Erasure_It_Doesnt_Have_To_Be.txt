You are on one side  
And I am on the other  
Are we divided?  
You are on one side  
I am on the other  
Are we divided?  
Why can't we live together  
There are no rights  
This isn't your decision  
We need to talk of changing things  
But no one wants to listen  
It doesn't have to be like that  
It doesn't have to be like that  
It doesn't have to be like that  
  
A heart on the inside  
The same as any other  
Are we divided?  
Someone always has to suffer  
We are broken  
There's no one left to change it  
Is that the way it has to be?  
Why can't we rearrange it?  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
What is the secret  
In calling me a brother?  
Are we divided?  
Always one against the other  
We are strong now  
Put down the ammunition  
For what we know is right  
Is gonna breakdown this division  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
You are one side  
And I am on the other  
Are we divided?
