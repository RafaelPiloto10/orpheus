1-2-3... go!  
  
Well all my life it's been the same  
Me, I cannot afford your fear of pain  
My frustration it needs release,  
Cut me open and hear me breath  
Playing punk keeps me sane  
Don't need drugs to numb the pain  
It keeps me alive  
I hope it helps you  
Do you think I want to let America ruin me?  
No way!  
  
I'm screaming out, somebody listen,  
It feels so good to share my pain  
I'm screaming out, somebody listen,  
It feels so good to share my pain  
  
Well I lost control and hurt myself  
I knew deep down that I needed some help  
This self abuse, it would not stop,  
No matter how hard I tried  
So I ran away from here  
And I pulled myself together  
Am I going insane? think again  
I got so fed up with being unstable  
No more!  
  
I'm screaming out, somebody listen,  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
  
I'm screaming out, somebody listen,  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
It feels so good to share my pain  
  
I'm screaming out!  
I'm screaming out!  
I'm screaming out!  
I'm screaming out!  
I'm screaming out!  
I'm screaming out!  
I'm screaming out!  
That I needed some help!
