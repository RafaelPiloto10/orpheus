You, you won't talk about what we see when the lights are out  
And I'm willing to hold your hand while you're lost,  
While you're so full of doubt  
Walk for miles, on your own loose ends, I'll find you there  
I'll find you there  
  
You, you walk up thin blue lines possible with reality  
And I, I see through small red eyes,  
Glowing still at your uncertainty  
Out of darkness you will come around, I know you will  
I know you will  
And I'll find you  
And I'll find you there
