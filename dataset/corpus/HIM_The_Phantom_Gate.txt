Watch out for the kiss  
  
There are things you should know  
Distance between us grow  
You're holding on strong  
Oh how easy it would be to let go  
  
It's taking you far too long  
You did not look at the fire  
It's taking you far too long  
And it has become our funeral pyre  
I spread my wings for you  
Heaven, let your gate be open  
I'll bless you with venomous kisses  
And death in it's own beauty  
  
Listen to my heart, to my  
Listen to my heart, to my  
  
I'm losing my faith in you  
You don't want it to be true  
There's nothing you can do  
There's nothing you can do  
  
I've lost my faith in you  
You did not look at the fire  
I've lost my faith, it's true  
And it has become our funeral pyre  
  
I spread my wings for you  
Heaven let your gate be open  
I'll bless you with venomous kisses  
My love in it's own cruelty  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting  
  
Listen to my heart to hear it sing  
A song of returning to heaven  
Feel my poison sting
