Sometimes when I'm walking  
I dream I'm being taken for granted  
It's then that I clearly imagine  
The Day That You Take Me For Granted  
  
You said, one day you're gonna realize  
You really have no sense of yourself  
And with no way to take it back  
You'll get frozen in your tracks  
Frozen in your tracks  
  
Sometimes when we're talking  
I feel like you're not even listening  
It's then that I clearly remember  
Rarely ever seeing you listening  
  
You said, when you gonna realize  
You really have no sense of yourself  
There's no way to take it back  
You've been frozen in your tracks  
  
Simpler than the rest, you don't do stupid games  
You're not more complex, you don't lay 'violent blame'  
  
Tonight I was walking (tonight I was walking)  
Feeling alone on this planet (feeling alone on this planet)  
When all at once something stopped me (when all at once something stopped me)  
(I realized I'd taken you for granted) I realized I'd taken you for granted  
  
And tonight I realized  
I really have no sense of myself  
No way to take it back  
I am frozen in my tracks  
I'm frozen in my tracks  
Frozen in my tracks
