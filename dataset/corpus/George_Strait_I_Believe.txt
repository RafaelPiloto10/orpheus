The night's as clear as a big desert sky  
But it's hard to see the stars with these tears in my eyes  
Yeah, it's hard not to cry  
There's twenty-six reasons why  
  
There's broken hearts that'll never be the same  
Shattered lives still reeling from the pain  
Of plans and dreams now gone  
Oh, how do you move on?  
  
But I believe  
There's someone who's looking after me  
Someone beside me night and day  
To light the way  
It's hard to conceive  
Something you can't see  
But I believe  
I believe  
  
There's twenty-six angels looking down from above  
Resting in his mercy, grace and love  
Time may never heel  
The sadness that we feel  
  
But I believe  
There's someone who's looking after me  
Someone beside me night and day  
To light the way  
It's hard to conceive  
Something you can't see  
But I believe  
I believe  
  
The rivers flow now that used to be dry  
As people all over the world start to cry  
But I believe
