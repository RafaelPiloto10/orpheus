He's gone  
You've lost  
Stay behind  
And count the cost  
You try  
You lose  
You don't fall in love by chance  
You choose  
  
It's a decision  
Made over time  
Should you take a risk  
And start to climb  
The steepest hill  
Only to find  
Halfway there  
You've been left behind?  
  
Choosing to love  
Is risking a lot  
And trying to change  
And to give all you've got  
But don't pretend  
It comes out of the blue  
You take a chance  
And see it through  
And if it's refused  
What can you do?  
Continue hopefully?  
Start anew?  
  
Lick your wounds  
Buy your booze  
You won't get drunk by accident  
You'll choose  
Don't blame him  
For refusing your bid  
He didn't decide to love  
You did  
  
Learn the lesson  
Take the blows  
You didn't fall in love by chance  
You chose  
Play the sad songs  
Sing the blues  
You don't fall in love by chance  
You choose
