Here's a photo I've been looking for  
It's a picture of thee boy next door  
And I loved him more than words could say  
Never knew it 'til he moved away  
  
Faded pictures in my scrapbook  
Just thought I'd take one more look  
And recall when we were all  
In the neighborhood  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Here's a photo of the neighborhood  
Here's the corner where we stood  
Here's a snapshot of dad's old car  
  
Never got us very far  
Faded pictures in my scrapbook  
Just thought I'd take one more look  
And recall when we were all  
  
In the neighborhood  
And all those friends  
Where did they go, I don't know  
All those friends we used to know  
In the neighborhood
