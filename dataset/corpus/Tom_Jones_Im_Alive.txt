I'm alive! And I see things mighty clear today, I'm alive!  
I'm alive! And I'm sitting here and doing my thing, I'm alive!  
And I'm real! I can breath and touch and see and feel, I'm alive  
I'm a man! I don't care if I?m right or wrong, I'm a man  
Na na, na na, na na, na na.  
  
I'm a man! And I'm red and yellow and black and tan, I'm a man!  
I'm alive! And I'm doin' my thing and singin' my song, I'm alive!  
And I'm real! I can breath and touch and see and feel and I'm alive!  
I'm a man! Who don't cares if the hair's too long, I'm a man!  
Na na, na na, na na, na na.  
Baby, baby, baby, baby yeah yeah
