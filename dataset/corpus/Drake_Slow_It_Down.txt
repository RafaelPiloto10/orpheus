[Verse 1:]  
Hey girl,  
Do you want my number?  
That way you can call me  
Everytime I come into town  
And then I will drive up to your house  
And take you out to dinner  
I don't expect nothing at all  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
[Verse 2: Drake]  
Hey girl,  
I'm back in Atlanta  
Second dates are lovely  
This time you should choose where we go  
Need suggestions?  
How about the movies?  
Mini golf or ice cream  
I'm not picky, you'll let me know  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
[Chorus:]  
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch  
Put a rush on it, get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right, then it's over with  
What if I don't call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow  
  
Maybe we should slow it down  
If you're ready,  
We can go all the way.  
We can go all the way..
