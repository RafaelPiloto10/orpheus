You toke your love away,to fast  
Left no chance to say,look back  
And know I no the truth it makes it easier,  
Maybe when time goes by,I'll Understand  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets pretend that I moved on,  
Then ill tell myself, that life goes on without you,  
Open My eyes,  
Look deep inside..,  
I run away,I runaway,I runaway..  
  
You throw it all away,So blind(so blind)  
Pushed me far from you in your life..(life)  
And now I no the tears won't lead, to lonleyness,  
Maybe when time goes by, I'll understand  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets pretend that I moved on,  
Then ill tell myself,that life goes on without you,  
Open My eyes,  
Look deep inside..,  
I run away,I runaway,I runaway.....  
  
I run away....  
I run away...  
I run away..  
  
[Chorus]  
Lets pretend that I moved on,  
Then ill tell myself,that life goes on without you,  
Open My eyes,  
Look deep inside..,  
I run away,I runaway,I runaway..  
  
Lets pretend that I moved on,  
Tell myself,that life goes on without you,  
Open My eyes,  
Look deep inside..,  
I runaway,I run away,I runaway.
