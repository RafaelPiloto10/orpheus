We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto  
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'  
The years have shown no kindness  
For the hard times we've been through  
  
We've squeezed the life from every dream  
And still go right on bluffin'  
With really nothin' left to hold onto  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We were young and foolishly mistaken  
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied  
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'  
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried  
  
Oh, why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Let's be honest with each other  
That's the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto
