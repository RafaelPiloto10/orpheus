Here we are at the crossroads again  
And neither of us knows the right way  
So here we go trying to get by  
The limits of our yesterdays  
And if it brings us down  
It wouldn't be the first time  
Over and over, we put our hearts on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time we fall  
We get a little stronger, baby  
Every time we walk away  
It hurts a little more  
Someday we may find  
We can make it last this time  
Until then, we give it all  
Everytime we fall (ohh)  
  
When you're gone  
Still burning me  
And I'm jealous of the sun that warms you  
And still I know  
I'm walkin' in your dreams  
And I ain't seen the last of you  
  
Cause there's a part of you  
That never really leaves  
Over and over  
You keep coming back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When one road ends  
There's always another one to try  
So we're goin' through these changes  
Time and time again  
You and me, there's no good-bye  
No good-bye  
  
Cause there's a part of you  
That never really leaves  
Over and over  
You keep coming back to me  
  
Every time we fall, ohhh  
I feel its getting stronger, baby  
Stronger, baby. stronger, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time we fall  
(Only makes us stronger)  
Every time we walk away  
(Hurts just a little bit more)  
Someday we may find  
(We can make it last this time)  
Until then we give it all  
Everytime we fall  
  
Every time we fall  
(We get a little stronger baby)  
Every time we walk away  
(Hurts just a little bit more)  
Someday we may find  
We can make it, we cam make it  
Until then we give it all  
Every time we fall
