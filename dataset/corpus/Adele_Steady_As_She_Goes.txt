Find yourself a girl  
And settle down  
Live a simple life  
In a quiet town  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
So steady as she goes  
  
Your friends have shown  
A kink  
In the single life  
You've had  
Too much to think  
Now you need a wife  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Well here we go again  
You've found yourself  
A friend  
That knows you well  
But no matter  
What you do  
You'll always feel  
As though you  
Tripped and fell  
  
So steady as she goes  
  
When you have completed  
What you thought  
You had to do  
And your blood's  
Depleted  
To the point  
Of stable glue  
  
Then you'll get along  
Then you'll get along  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Well here we go again  
You've found yourself  
A friend  
That knows you well  
But no matter  
What you do  
You'll always feel  
As though you  
Tripped and fell  
  
So steady as she goes  
Steady as she goes  
  
Settle for a girl  
(Settle for a girl)  
Neither up or down  
(Neither up or down)  
Sell it to the crowd  
(Sell it to the crowd)  
That is gathered round  
(That is gathered round)  
  
Settle for a girl  
(Settle for a girl)  
Neither up or down  
(Neither up or down)  
Sell it to the crowd  
(Sell it to the crowd)  
That is gathered round  
(That is gathered round)  
  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Steady as she go  
Are you steady now?  
Steady as she goes  
Are you steady now?  
  
Steady as she goes  
Are you steady now?  
Steady as she goes  
Are you steady now?  
  
Steady as she goes
