Love this time of year  
It seems to bring us near  
I wish Christmas was every day  
There's somethin' about those lights  
On that tree at night  
Feelin' you girl, next to me  
  
Oh baby, baby the way we kiss  
Under the mistletoe  
A laugh like little children  
Makin' angels in the snow  
Well it's in your eyes  
And in your smile it shows  
That this very special time of year  
It seems to set your heart a glow  
Oh sing it with me baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, it's Christmas, you know it's Christmas  
And it's our favorite time of year  
Bells will be ringin'  
Our hearts are singin'  
Well I'm glad it's Christmas time once again  
  
The city's lit up bright  
On this starry night  
But there's somethin' left to do  
Go home and light a fire  
Tell me your heart's desire  
Wrap me up, take me away  
  
Oh when I'm with you darlin'  
There's so much love that I want to share  
I know you feel it too  
There's magic in the air  
And in this, sweet, sweet memories  
We share together  
They're gonna last us now  
Now and for ever  
For ever and ever  
  
[Chorus]
