Here I go,  
Falling down, down, down,  
My mind is a blank,  
My head is spinning around and around,  
As I go deep into the funnel of love.  
  
It's such a crazy, crazy feeling,  
I get weak in the knees,  
My poor old head is a reelin',  
As I go deep into the funnel of love.  
  
I tried and I tried, to run and hide,  
I even tried to run away,  
You just can't run from the funnel of love,  
It's gonna get you someday.

My mind is a blank,  
My head is spinning around and around,  
As I go deep into the funnel of love,  
Deep into the funnel of love,  
Deep into the funnel of love.
