Can I dance?  
Oh, oh, oh, aww shit!  
Big Boi, Big boi  
  
What if everything you ever knew or known was lost  
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts  
You pause for the cause,try to recall and remember  
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center  
Cause your mind ain't free, constricting by the motherfuckin' boundaries  
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro  
Couldn't place you on the planet where  
I'm transmitting life from bro brother, bro hem  
Cadillac on bows, strike a pose then the door slams,  
Wham nigga wham, don't they say that in they show damn  
For show man, acting like a tadpole out of gonads,  
You now how catch the truth, hit the booth we making more jams  
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program, fuck the learning
curve  
We took our ramp to no man's land  
Hello,is anybody home, is anybody giving dome  
Serve me up I want some  
  
[Chorus]  
Buggface toe jam, from the face up cause you don't give a jam  
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam  
Imagine me now jamming, shoving it up your monkey jam  
Buggface toe jam, from the face up cause you don't give a jam  
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam  
Imagine me now jamming, shoving it up your monkey jam  
  
When I'm left alone I get to thinking to myself  
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until none's left  
Like everything is alright clearly tight to death  
I can see clearly now analyzing every step  
Clearly you can feel me cause it's beating through your chest  
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet  
With no tint not yet,clearly I'm a vet  
And not a veterinarian, but clearly pitbulls are the best  
Like the O-U-T-K-S, cleary nigga you know the rest  
And if you acting like you don't, cleary nigga you trying to test  
Crystal clearly I confess, and I suggest, you clear the runway  
Cause the ticket is a one-way, clearly back we won't be coming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can I dance?  
Can I dance?  
  
Oh shit, bamboo! Stop!  
Y'all just playing around now! Come on Cross!
