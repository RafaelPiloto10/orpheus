If you walked away from me today  
I am sure that who you were going to  
Would feel the way that I do  
Baby it's you  
Who fills up my life  
And if you walked away from me today  
Never to return until the journey  
That you made had ended  
I know you planned it  
Just to fill up my life  
  
Fill my life  
Till now  
No one's been able to show me how  
To fill my life like you  
You are the woman who taught me to  
  
And if you walked away from me today  
It wouldn't change a thing  
I'd still be singing celebration of you  
Baby you do  
You fill up my life  
  
Fill my life  
Now I know  
What it feels like to overflow  
Until my life is through  
All I'm here for is here for you  
  
Fill my life  
Now I see  
What it feels like to be set free  
Until my life is through  
All I'm here for  
Is here for you  
Just for you  
Only for you  
Hey hey...oooo
