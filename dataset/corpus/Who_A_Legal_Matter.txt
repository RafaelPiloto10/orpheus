I told you why I changed my mind  
I got bored by playing with time  
I know you thought you had me nailed  
But I've freed my head from your garden rails  
  
Now it's a legal matter, baby  
You got me on the run  
It's a legal matter, baby  
A legal matter from now on  
  
My mind's lost in a household fog  
Wedding gowns and catalogs  
Kitchen furnishings and houses  
Maternity clothes and baby's trousers  
  
Now it's a legal matter, baby  
Marryin's no fun  
It's a legal matter, baby  
A legal matter from now on  
  
I told you why I changed my mind  
I got bored by playing with time  
I know you thought you had me nailed  
Well, I've freed my head from your garden rails  
  
Now it's a legal matter, baby  
You got me on the run  
It's a legal matter, baby  
A legal matter from now on  
  
You ain't the first and you ain't the last  
I gain and lose my women fast  
I never want to make them cry  
I just get bored, don't ask me why  
  
Just wanna keep doing all the dirty little things I do  
And not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you  
Sorry, baby
