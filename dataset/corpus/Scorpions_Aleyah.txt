The easy way  
Is not the way my life will take  
Because the limit is the sky  
The easy way  
Is not the way that I can take  
My life's in pieces half the time  
Dancing on a razor blade  
Break the ice but never break  
Where the time meets destiny  
Take your chance and come with me  
Aleyah  
The easy way  
Is not the way that I can take  
I keep on dancing in the sky  
It's the way  
And not the goal that will make it  
All so special in my life  
Dancing on the pulse of time  
Bring it home across the line  
Come with me  
Aleyah  
Dancing on a razor blade  
Break the ice but never break  
Where the time meets destiny  
Take your chance and come with me  
Aleyah  
Life in the fast lane  
Don't you think baby  
To make it up there  
We gotta be crazy
