Oooohhhh ooohhhh  
  
I used to go out of my mind tryna re define the real meaning of love  
I lost my dignity forgot about me I was so lost in us  
I had to take on, cause you had me stuck in the middle of nowhere  
And my faith it would shake, I know you're trying your best to take me  
  
Chorus: dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Been standing in the way for far too long  
Dream maker now it's taking your place  
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay  
Dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long  
  
You used to be the man of my dreams only now it seems you were just a
nightmare  
But this little light of mine told me open my eyes there's more than darkness
out there  
I'm not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya  
I'm not afraid of ya  
I've escaped from ya  
And my faith is in place  
In the night I no longer see your face!  
  
Chorus  
Dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Been standing in my way for far too long  
Dream maker now it's taking your place  
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay  
Dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long  
  
Ooohhhhhhhhhh From ashes to ashes and dust to us!  
Ooohhhh I'm not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya, I'm not afraid of ya  
I've escaped from ya  
I'm not gonna run from ya  
Imma walk from ya  
I'm not afraid of ya  
I've escaped from ya (yeahhh)  
  
Chorus: Dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Been standing in my way for far too long  
Dream maker now it's taking your place  
I'm no longer asleep my heart is finally awake  
So goodbye, good day, farewell, it's okay  
Dream taker won't you leave me alone  
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long  
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long  
Can't wait til you're gone haven't dreamt in so long
