Well it takes more than a robin to make the winter go  
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow  
Well it takes two hearts a cookin' to make a fire grow  
And baby you've got what it takes  
You know it takes a lot of kissin' to make a romance bloom  
Yeah yeah it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete  
Yeah it takes a lot of woman to knock me off of my feet  
And baby you've got what it takes  
Yeah I said,  
You know honey you've got just what it takes  
  
It takes more than an effort to stay away from you  
And it'd take more than a lifetime yeah to prove that I'll be true  
Well it takes somebody special to make me say I do  
And baby you've got what it takes  
C'mon now,  
You know honey you've got just what it takes  
Because it takes more than an effort  
And baby you've got what it takes
