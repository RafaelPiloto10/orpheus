Work ourselves, fingers to the bone  
Suck the marrow, drain my soul  
Fingers to the bone  
Pay your dues, and your debts  
Pay your respects, everybody tells you  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how she's doin'  
Has she really lost her mind?  
I said, I couldn't tell you  
I've lost mine  
  
Words, words, words, have you heard  
A bird in hand is much better than,  
Any number free to wander  
Fly away...stay  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Is she really all she says...  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Since she went away  
I said I couldn't tell you  
I'm OK I'm OK (I'm OK)  
  
Surprise, surprise  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Has she really lost her...  
Everybody asks me how she's doing  
Since she went away  
I said I couldn't tell you  
I'm OK I'm OK I'm OK (How are you?)  
  
Pay for what you get  
Pay for what you get...oh...  
Pay for what you get  
Pay for what you get oh...  
Oh...
