Life ain't worth a-livin'  
People just been givin' me  
Friendship happiness is what everybody deserves  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I don't have to ask for everything I get  
Everyone just lets me down  
Tries to make me look like a fool  
Won't accept me for what I am  
They say I got to live by the rules  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I don't have to ask for everything I get  
It's gotta end sometime  
How's it gonna be yeah  
Are we wrong or are we right  
It's gotta end sometime  
Calling you and me yeah  
It's gonna take a long long time  
  
Seems like they don't give a damn  
Won't let me live just how I want  
They say I'm a down-and-out  
But it's them that's wrong  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I don't have to ask for everything I get  
  
Verse 3  
  
Cos' she gives me everything I want (We don't need nobody else)
