Honey, I know you've been alone some,  
Why don't you 'phone some, 'cause I love you.  
An' honey, I know I've been away some,  
I've had to pay some and you have too.  
  
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,  
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.  
I've been put down, pushed around, apprehended and led down town.  
An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,  
'Cause I'm restless tonight.  
  
I just can't stand bein' alone.  
Gonna have to change that some day.  
There's a restless feelin' in my bones an' I know,  
That at times, it just won't go away.  
  
So if it's all the same, honey, I can't take the blame, baby,  
I can't play your game, honey, what's true is true.  
And if, in the end, the temptation wears you thin, honey,  
I'll, I'll just pretend that I'll leave it up to you.  
  
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,  
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.  
I've been put down, pushed around, apprehended andled down town.  
Can't help it if I'm full of fire.  
  
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,  
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.  
I've been put down, pushed around,apprehended and led down town.  
An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,  
'Cause I'm restless tonight.
