What you're sayin' it never really crossed my mind  
I hear playin' and everybody's keepin' time  
I'm recallin' that girl I met in London town  
She was strange, young and tender and narrowed all my choices down  
  
[Chorus]  
We ran away into the night hypnotized  
You carved your name right next to mine, English Eyes  
  
I was tryin' to read her lips and knew the time was drawing near  
I forgot what she said but I remember how she whispered in my ear  
I can hear laughter coming from the places we once knew  
There were stories from a stranger out of nowhere but they seemed so true  
  
[Chorus]  
English eyes,  
English eyes  
  
Where are you  
When I call out your name?  
English eyes  
  
Red sky warning, girl you really put a spell on me  
Never told me 'bout the daddy you refused to please  
You took the bishop when the king was standing right in front of you  
There's nothing in it if I can't have a girl with eyes like you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
English Eyes, yeah,  
English Eyes,  
English Eyes
