Please clean your plate dear  
The Lord above can see you  
Don't you know people are starving in Korea  
  
Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles  
Kindergarten people, they use them, they need them  
  
The over-indulgent machines were their children  
There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool them  
'Cause they looked just like humans  
At Kresge's and Woolworth's  
But decadent brains were at work to destroy  
Rats in batallions were ruling the street scene  
Generation landslide  
Closed the gap between 'em  
  
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies  
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies  
  
Militant mothers hiding in their basements  
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets  
  
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs  
While Mother's Lib burned birth certificate papers  
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer  
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance  
  
Sister's out till five doing banker's son's hours  
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father  
  
Stopped at full speed at one hundred miles per hour  
  
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em  
  
But I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies  
  
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
