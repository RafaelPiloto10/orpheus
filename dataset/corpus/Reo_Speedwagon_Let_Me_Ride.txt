I've been on the road now for a day and a night  
I've been lonesome and hungry for miles  
I've seen how you people been lookin' your lies  
I'm gonna kill y'all with your own smiles  
But I wish that y'all could get a look at the news  
And see what the man's puttin' down  
Well I gotta hold a one yesterday night  
And they threw me outta this town, oh yeah  
Well it's gonna be awhile before I get home  
But when I do that's the end of my roamin'  
Cause I've been gone a lifetime and I can't believe  
That the people I trust still can deceive  
  
By the time I get back here things have to change  
'Cause if they don't there's gonna be a lot of strange  
Lookin' people marchin' round, clappin' their hands  
And they won't stop till everyone understands  
  
Oh yeah  
Let me ride, let me ride  
Let me ride now, let me ride now, yeah  
  
Livin's just like sleepin'  
Why is life not like a dream  
Now the dawn is weepin'  
Another sunlight sees  
Oh I've been here too long now  
I got to go outside  
Ya people gotta let me ride  
  
Let me ride, ride, ride  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
  
Ya people gotta let me ride  
Let me ride, ride, ride  
I gotta feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside  
I got to feel free inside
