I got lonely sometime you were gone and left  
Like you always do  
You were never there when I needed some care  
You were never there when I needed somebody to talk to  
Somebody came and took your place  
Oh baby, somebody took my place in your heart I can say  
I'm used to it by now  
'Cause it happens all the time that is one test I always fail  
But one thing my heart can't understand  
Who's gonna take the place of this boy in my heart  
We used to play together  
Do everything together  
But now what am I gonna say  
You've got no right to call me father  
I've got no right to call you son  
You got no right to talk to me  
I've got no right to talk to you  
Even though I try so hard to be strong  
But it hurts inside  
As I pack my bags to go now baby  
I thought I could share this with you  
The next time you fall in love treat your woman right  
Remember that her place is not only in the kitchen  
All she needs is tender loving care  
You've got no right to call me father  
I've got no right to call you son  
You got no right to talk to me  
I've got no right to talk to you  
Even though I try so hard to be strong  
But it hurts inside  
You've got no right to call me father  
I've got no right to call you son  
You got no right to talk to me  
I've got no right to talk to you  
Even though I try so hard to be strong  
But it hurts inside  
You've got no right to call me father  
I've got no right to call you son  
You got no right to talk to me  
I've got no right to talk to you  
Even though I try so hard to be strong  
But it hurts inside  
...
