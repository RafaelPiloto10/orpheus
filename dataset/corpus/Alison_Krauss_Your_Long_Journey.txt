God's given us years of happiness here  
Now we must part  
And as the angels come and call for you  
The pains of grief tug at my heart  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey  
  
Oh the days will be empty  
The nights so long without you my love  
And when god calls for you I'm left alone  
But we will meet in heaven above  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey  
  
Fond memories I'll keep of happy ways  
That on earth we trod  
And when I come we will walk hand in hand  
As one in heaven in the family of god  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey
