Baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me  
Let me share your love even if it's only in your mind  
Baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me  
Dreams of happiness and secret pleasures we have yet to find  
And though we're far apart won't you treat me in your heart  
Till I'm back in your arms where I belong  
And dream sweet dreams about me till I'm home  
  
The time has come and it won't keep that flame on the ground much longer  
I've got to say goodbye for a while  
So hold me one more time cause hon I'm gonna miss you oh I miss you  
So before I go just let me see your smile  
And baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me  
Let me share your love even if it's only in your mind  
And though we're far apart  
  
Baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me till I'm home
