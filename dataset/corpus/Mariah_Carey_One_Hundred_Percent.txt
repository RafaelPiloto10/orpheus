I am a dream  
Just beginning  
Truth is, I prayed  
And you opened my eyes  
And you revealed  
Something to me  
Suddenly I am no longer confined  
  
To a life that's defined by limits  
I don't need no permission to live it  
Imma break through the door 'til I get in  
Everything that I got I'm gonna give it  
  
One hundred percent  
And I ain't stopping  
'Til I reach the finish  
  
I'm a believer  
Not just a dreamer  
I'm giving everything I got  
I'm a go-getter  
One hundred percenter  
Undoubtedly I can reach the top  
  
I ain't gonna let nothing  
Discourage or dissuade me  
'Cause I'm walking out of here  
A champion either way, babe  
I'm giving it one hundred percent  
So go on put your ones up  
  
If you're puttin' in one hundred  
Put your ones up (ones up)  
If you know that this is something  
Put your ones up (ones up)  
If you really comprehend this  
Put your ones up (ones up)  
If you're walking into victory  
Keep on shining (One hundred)  
One hundred percent  
  
You can only do it  
If you do it  
Like I did  
'Cause suffering  
Ain't easy but  
If you can  
Turn your wounds  
Into living proof  
That you survived  
The fight  
And you're no longer defined  
  
To a life that's defined by limits  
I don't need no permission to live it  
Imma break through the door 'til I get in  
Everything that I got I'm gonna give it  
  
One hundred percent  
And I ain't stopping  
'Til I reach the finish  
  
I'm a believer  
Not just a dreamer  
I'm giving everything I got

Let nobody take your courage  
If you gonna pray, don't worry  
If ya gonna wait, don't pray  
You just keep the faith  
And listen to me
