I've been mistreated, I've been abused  
I've been struck downhearted baby, I've been confused  
'cause I know yes I know I've been mistreated yeah-eah  
Since my baby left me, I've been losing my mind  
You know I have  
I've been lonely, I've been cold  
I've been looking for a woman uh to have and hold  
'cause I know yes I know I've been mistreated yeah-eah  
Since my baby left me, I've been losing... I've been losing...  
I've been losing my mind  
Baby baby baby  
  
I've been mistreated ah I've been abused... Mmm  
I've been looking for a woman, I've been confused  
'cause I know yes I know I've been mistreated... Ooh  
Since my baby left me, I've been losing... Losing...  
I've been losing my mind  
Baby baby baby ou-ouh oh woman woman woman  
  
I've been losing my mind
