A long long time ago  
In a galaxy far away  
Naboo was under an attack  
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn  
Could talk the Federation into  
Maybe cutting them a little slack  
But their response, it didn't thrill us  
They locked the doors and tried to kill us  
We escaped from that gas  
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass  
We took a bongo from the scene  
And we went to Theed to see the queen  
We all wound up on Tatooine  
That's where we found this boy  
  
Oh my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
  
Did you know this junkyard slave  
Isn't even old enough to shave  
But he can use the Force they say  
Ah, do you see him hitting on the queen  
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen  
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday  
Well, I know he built C3PO  
And I've heard how fast his pod can go  
And we were broke, it's true  
So we made a wager or two  
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace  
And the minute Jabba started off that race  
Well, I know who would win first place  
Oh yes, it was our boy  
  
We started singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
  
Now we finally got to Coruscant  
The Jedi Council we knew would want  
To see how good the boy could be  
So we took him there and we told the tale  
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale  
And he might fulfill that prophecy  
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course  
Could he bring balance to the force?  
They interviewed the kid  
Oh, training they forbid  
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear  
And Qui-Gon said, "Now listen here  
Just stick it in your pointy ear  
I still will teach this boy"  
  
He was singin' my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
  
We caught a ride back to Naboo  
Cause Queen Amidala wanted to  
I frankly would've liked to stay  
We all fought in that epic war  
And it wasn't long at all before  
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day  
And in the end some Gungans died  
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried  
A lot of folks were croakin'  
The battle droids were broken  
And the Jedi I admire most  
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast  
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost  
I guess I'll train this boy  
  
And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
We were singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
