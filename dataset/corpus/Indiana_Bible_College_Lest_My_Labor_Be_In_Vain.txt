Verse 1  
Justice beckons for those who glory in their shame  
Hell enlarges for sinners to quickly claim  
And while this happens e pray to be blessed,  
With eyes ignoring the ripe harvest  
  
Chorus  
Lord give me a piece of your desire  
And let it become all mine  
Take the eyes off me, so I can see souls dying  
Let me labor for this gospel  
Without a pause or refrain  
Give me love for the harvest  
Lest my labor be in vain  
Lest my labor be in vain  
  
Verse 2  
And it's almost time for Gabriel's trumpet to resound,  
Heralding the time when the saints of God receive a crown  
And as I step forward to receive my life's reward,  
I must have a soul with me to present to the Lord  
  
Bridge  
It's harvest time. Harvest time  
The grain is falling, the Savior's calling  
Oh do not wait, it's growing late  
Behold the fields are white  
It's harvest time  
  
Chorus 2  
Lord give me a piece of your desire  
And let it become all mine  
Take the eyes off me so I can see souls dying  
(Open my eyes Lord)  
Let me labor for this gospel  
Without a pause or refrain  
  
Vamp  
Give me a love for the harvest (2x)  
We need a love for the harvest (4x)  
He is the Lord of the harvest (2x)  
Give me a love for the harvest  
  
Ending  
Lest my labor be in vain  
Lest my labor be in vain
