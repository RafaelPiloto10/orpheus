Potato skins, potato cakes  
Hash browns, and instant flakes  
Baked or boiled or french fried  
There's no kind you haven't tried  
  
You planned a trip to Idaho  
Just to watch potatoes grow  
I understand how you must feel  
I can't deny they've got appeal  
  
Whoah  
You like them whether they are plain or they're stuffed, oh yeah  
Better face the facts, it seems you can't get enough  
You know, you're gonna have to face it  
You're addicted to spuds  
  
Your greasy hands, your salty lips  
Looks like you found the chips  
Your belly aches, your teeth grind  
Some tator tots would blow your mind  
  
And you don't mind if they're not cooked  
You need your fix, I guess you're hooked  
And late at night you always dream  
Of bacon bits and sour cream  
  
Whoah, you like them even if they're lumpy or tough, oh yeah  
Whee, It's pretty obvoius to me you can't get enough  
You know you're gonna have to face it  
You're addicted to spuds  
  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds  
  
Ooh yeah  
  
I'm givin' up, it'sjust no use  
Another case of spud abuse  
What can I say, what can I do  
Potato bug has got me too, Wahoo  
  
I used to hate them, now they're all that I eat, oh yeah  
Whee, I've often seen then whipped, but they just can't be beat  
Now I'm gonna have to face it  
I'm addicted to spuds  
  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds  
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
