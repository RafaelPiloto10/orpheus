When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?  
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost  
  
At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win  
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
We all like to put the blame on society these days  
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings  
  
Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart  
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad  
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane  
  
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn  
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
The thin line between love and hate  
  
The thin line between love and hate
