Satan rejected my soul  
He knows my kind  
He won't be dragged down  
He's seen my face around  
He knows Heaven doesn't seem  
To be my home  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So, take it - please  
It's free  
You'll never see  
You'll never see  
All the fun in life it's cost me  
Satan rejected my soul  
As low as he goes  
He never quite goes this low  
He's seen my face around  
He knows Heaven doesn't seem  
To be my home  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So, take it please  
It's really sly  
Come on, come on, ah  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take it please  
It's really sly  
Come on, come on, ah  
Come on, come on, come on  
Call me in  
Pull me in, call me in  
Come on, come on, oh  
Come on, come on, come on  
Pull me in, pull me in  
Call me in, haul me in, pull me in  
Come on, come on, ah  
Come on, come on  
La la la la la  
Oh...
