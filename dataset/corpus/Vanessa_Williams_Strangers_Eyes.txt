All alone, a rainy night  
No one around but I fell someone watching me  
I look around, the street is bare nobody there  
I wonder what it could be  
As I turned to walk away  
Suddenly I saw his face  
Never minding that we were alone  
Didn't care about the time, at the moment I was felling fine  
  
I was looking into stranger's eyes  
(he caught me by surprise)  
They looked right through me  
(he looking into my eyes)  
Never knew  
Never, ever thought that love could be  
(that's when he came)  
He came and captured me  
  
Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it  
Kind of strange and familiar  
But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feeling  
I get the feeling he knows me  
Maybe I could stay a while, maybe I could make you smile  
I don't have much to do  
Maybe we could walk awhile  
Maybe, maybe we could talk awhile  
  
Can't help looking into stranger's eyes  
I was looking into stranger's eyes  
(he caught me by surprise)  
They looked right through me  
(he looked into my eyes)  
Never knew  
Never, ever thought that love could be  
(that's when he came)  
He came and captured me  
  
How was I to know this would happen  
Thought I didn't know I would meet this stranger  
It's the kind of thing that dreams are made of  
And I keep thinking about stranger's eyes  
I was looking into stranger's eyes  
(he caught me by surprise)  
They looked right through me  
(he looked into my eyes)  
Never knew  
Never, ever thought that love could be  
(that's when he came to me)  
He came and captured me
