Felt so right for awhile, almost really believed  
I could stay here forever, my heart could be free  
Oh I wish it were that easy, but it's never been for me  
I'm not your girl  
  
Feels so warm and so safe here, now don't get me wrong  
But it's selfish to stay here, I'd be leading you on  
Maybe someone else can give you  
What you really, really want  
I'm not your girl  
  
They say people change  
I wish it were true  
It's something I've tried so hard to do  
I can't explain  
Why right feels so wrong  
And I keep hearing the same old song  
  
See, I've been here before, left a good thing behind  
Can't see where I'm going, maybe love's really blind  
I'm so afraid to lose the one, who was so hard to find  
But I'm not your girl  
  
They say people change  
I wish it were true  
It's something I've tried so hard to do  
I can't explain  
Why right feels so wrong  
And I keep hearing the same old song  
  
One day I'll come back here, and I'll knock at your door  
She'll be sweet when she answers, then I'll know for sure  
That life is never easy, in my complicated world  
I'm not your girl
