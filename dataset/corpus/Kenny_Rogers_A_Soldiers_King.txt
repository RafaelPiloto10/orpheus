No one seemed to notice the man beside the road  
He was just a ragged soldier out there in the cold  
But he seemed to have a purpose only known to him  
As he walked along the streets that night through the town of Bethlehem.  
  
In his head he held a memory of all the wars he'd known  
In his hand he clutched a medal for the bravery he'd shown  
And the weight of every battle he carried in his heart  
But his eyes were clear and searching for a manger in the dark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall  
Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all  
But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light  
Like the soldier who found his king tonight.  
  
He had marched for politicians, served under their command  
And he fought for all the causes that he did not understand  
But it was something deep inside him now that led him on his way  
With a single star to guide him to were the baby lay.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He stood before the Son of God, come to pay our debt  
He smiled up at the soldier that the world would soon forget  
So he held out his medal and said this for you I bring  
There he swore allegiance to the newborn baby King.  
  
[Chorus]
