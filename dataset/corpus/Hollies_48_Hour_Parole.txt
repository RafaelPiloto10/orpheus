I'm gettin out and steppin' in  
To somewhere where it's warmer  
First come will be first served  
You'd better put in your order  
Been out in the cold far too long  
Gonna set the town on fire (fire)  
If you're not with me you better step aside  
This boy's out for the kill kickin' higher  
Oh 48 hour parole,  
But I got to be a good boy  
Oh 48 hour parole  
Toein' the line ain't my style  
And I ain't looking for trouble  
I wasn't born I was carved out of stone  
So don't try bustin' my bubble  
chorus  
verse 1  
verse 2  
chorus x3
