I met her at the Burger King we fell in love by the soda machine  
So we took the car downtown the kids were hanging out all around  
Then we went down to Coney Island on the coaster and around again  
And no one's gonna ever tear us apart cause she's my sweetheart  
All right, oh yeah  
  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
  
Hanging out on a night like this I'm gonna give her a great big kiss  
I'm gonna make her mine and everything's gonna be real fine
