Baby, if you say you still care,  
I follow you most anywhere  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
And in the darkest night,  
I'll keep you safe and alright  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
Won't you roll away the stone,  
Why be cold and so alone  
Won't you roll away the stone,  
Don't you let it lie  
No matter if fools say we can't win,  
I know I'll fall in love again  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
So sing, we still got a chance,  
Baby for love and sweet romance  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
Won't you roll away the stone  
Don't you let it die  
Just kick it away
