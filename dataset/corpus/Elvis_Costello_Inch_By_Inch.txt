You can take a powder  
You can take a drink  
You can keep the shrink  
And the kitchen sink  
Write my name in heaven  
In invisible ink  
I just woke up from dreaming, I think  
  
You can take me over  
You can give me a lip  
You can take me under  
You can give me the slip  
Take off everything or tear me off a strip  
Like a lady in the chamber  
And another in the clip  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't move a muscle baby  
Don't even flinch  
You can miss me by a mile  
Or just inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
You can pull me up again  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
As pulses race  
I long to see that look upon your face  
  
You can take me outside  
You can take me apart  
You can take me upstairs  
You can take me to heart  
You made me love you when  
You thought you were so smart  
Don't try to stop me when  
You told me to start  
  
[Chorus]
