You talk about your woman  
I wish you could see mine,  
You talk about your woman  
I wish you could see mine,  
Every time she starts to lovin'  
She brings eyesight to the blind.  
  
You know her daddy gave her magic  
I can tell by the way she walks.  
You know her daddy gave her magic  
I can tell by the way she walks.  
Every time we start shakin'  
The dumb begin to talk.  
  
She's got the power to heal you never fear  
She's got the power to heal you never fear  
Just a word from her lips  
And the deaf begin to hear.
