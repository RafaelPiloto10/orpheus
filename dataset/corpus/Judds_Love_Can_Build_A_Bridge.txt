I'd gladly walk across the desert  
With no shoes upon my feet  
To share with you the last bite  
Of bread i had to eat  
I would swim out to save you  
In your sea of broken dreams  
When all your hopes are sinkin'  
Let me show you what love means  
  
[Chorus]  
Love can build a bridge  
Between your heart and mine  
Love can build a bridge  
Don't you think it's time?  
Don't you think it's time?  
  
I would whisper love so loudly, every heart could understand  
That love and only love can join the trials of man  
I would give my heart's desire so that you might see  
The first step is to realize that it all begins with you and me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When we stand together, it's our finest hour  
We can do anything, anything  
We're believing in the power  
  
[Chorus: x2]
