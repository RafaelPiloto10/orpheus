Everybody is lazy  
Nobody wants to do anything  
Everyone's crazy  
At times i think i've had enough of it  
Living together  
It's not a easy thing to begin  
Making life a little better  
Takes the power of your second please  
I've been around to love  
I'm trying hard, i know  
I haven't reach my ball  
I'll do what I have to do  
Someday we'll see it through  
As long as i have you  
  
We've got to keep on pushing  
(we've got to keep on pushing)  
We've got to keep on trying  
(we've got to keep on trying)  
We've got to keep on pushing  
(we've got to keep on pushing)  
We've got to keep on trying  
(we've got to keep on trying)  
We've got to keep on pushing  
(we've got to keep on pushing)  
We've got to keep on trying  
(we've got to keep on trying)  
We've got to keep on pushing  
(we've got to keep on pushing)  
We've got to keep on trying  
(we've got to keep on trying)
