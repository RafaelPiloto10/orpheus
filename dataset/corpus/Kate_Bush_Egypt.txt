Follow the Nile, Deep to much deeper,  
The Pyramids sound lonely tonight.  
  
The sands run red, in Lands of the Pharaohs,  
Their symmetry gets right inside me.  
  
I cannot stop to comfort them,  
I'm busy chasing up my demon,  
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt.  
  
My Pussy Queen, knows all my secrets,  
I'll never fall in love again.  
  
I drift with Dunes,  
I whisper of the tombs,  
They offer me Egyptian Delights.  
  
She's got me with that feline 'guise,  
Got me in those Desert eyes,  
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt.
