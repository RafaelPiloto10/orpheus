Mr. Bigs, you know you got to keep me jigs  
Mr. Bigs, you know you got to keep me jigs  
Mr. Bigs  
  
1 - Float on, float on, float on, float on  
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)  
Float on, float on, float on, float on  
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)  
  
Can't get you off of my mind  
Girl I've been thinking of you  
So lets not waste our time  
Tell me what you want to do  
  
Your body's hot for mine  
Girl let me hold you real tight  
Don't rush lets take our time  
I wanna love you all night  
  
You know just what to do  
Go down and taste my love  
I'll do the same for you  
You know what I'm thinking of  
Tonight I'm gonna cry  
Until I'm soaking wet  
Do every thing you like  
Baby comfort me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Don't wanna stop this groove  
Just wanna keep goin on  
The way your body moves  
Oh girl I can't let you go  
Just let me come inside  
Until you can't take no more  
You're body wrapped on mine  
Now baby, let me explode  
  
You gotta give me some more  
I love the way it feels  
The way you caress me  
Take me to ecstasy  
Oh baby up and down  
Just hit it all around  
This love it feels so right  
Bring it hold me too  
  
Little Kim you don't know what type of chick this is  
Number one baller of the mistresses  
Mr. Bigs you know you got to keep me jigs  
Even though it might mean stealing chips from kids  
You know why summer clothes too hot for you folks  
Get "c" notes every time I do coats  
Ya loosing it, acting like ya new to this  
Get true to this make it shift in my uterus  
Sexing in the ass, ay Martin, when wifey comes home  
Get the dough and I'm departing  
I wanna see if you can make me scream I hate ya  
Give me back shots of sweat out, my cream of nature  
  
Don't you stop  
You turn me on I need release, whoa  
Love me here, touch me there  
Something to share  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Ad lib until fade
