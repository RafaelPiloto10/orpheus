If I Could  
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes  
Give you courage in a world of compromise  
Yes I would  
If I could  
I would teach you all the things I've never learned  
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned  
Yes I would  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I've watched you grow  
So I could let you go  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
If I live in a time and place where you don't want to be  
You don't have to walk along this road with me  
My yesterday won't have to be your way  
If I knew  
How I'd try to change the world I brought you to  
And there isn't very much that I can do  
But I would  
If I could  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But that part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I watched you grow so I could let you go  
If, if I could  
I would help you make it through those hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
Yes I would  
Yes I would  
If I could
