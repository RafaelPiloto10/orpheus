Blue blue days, and long black nights,  
Lonesome tears you're gonna cry for me.  
  
And little baby,  
You'd better start baby, and leave.  
  
Think it over before you leave,  
I got the love, that kind you need.  
  
And little baby,  
You'd better start baby and leave.  
  
I'll rave on with the things you say,  
You say you're gonna leave but that'll be the day.  
  
Maybe baby, you don't know,  
I left Peggy Sue, a long time ago.  
  
She's the girl on my mind,  
Everyday through all the time.  
  
And little baby,  
You'd better start baby and leave.  
  
I'll rave on with those things you say,  
You say you're gonna leave but that'll be the day.  
  
Maybe baby, you don't know,  
I left Peggy Sue, a long time ago.  
  
She's the girl on my mind,  
Everyday through all the time.  
  
And little baby,  
You'd better start baby and leave.  
  
And little baby,  
You'd better start baby and leave.
