There's nothing I want but money and time  
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick  
There's nothing more cruel  
Than only nine lives  
A limit in spite  
Will do the trick trick trick trick  
  
We can leave the house lead the party let the people know  
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go  
  
There's nothing as fun as coming untied  
And running with the kids in the park park park park  
There's nothing that hurts like letting you go  
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark  
  
We can leave the house lead the party let the people know  
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go  
It's not about just being out with all our people  
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw  
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know  
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
