There was a time when no one  
Could ever take your place  
[That's not the case anymore]  
Took for granted that tomorrow was ours to play  
  
Boy things have changed  
Nothing stayed the same  
When you chose to move away  
  
[Chorus]  
Haven't heard your voice in so very long  
Say I've been missed but I wouldn't know  
I might be better off living on my own  
'cause love won't last now that hope is gone  
Promised the distance wouldn't change a thing  
Now the fault is work, it's keeping you away  
You'd try harder if you want my love  
If you want my love  
  
Careless intentions  
Is what this has become  
[I'm struck with a broken heart]  
Here we're flowing on emotions  
Of what once was  
  
Boy things have changed  
Nothing stayed the same  
When you chose to move away  
[move away]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Looking back on how things used to be  
No one could tell me that this would be our destiny  
And now I'm facing life on my own without you baby  
Though we're miles apart - you had my heart  
  
I'm tired of the confusion I'd rather just be friends  
[There's no hope of a second chance]  
No sense in going through the motions  
Like it's not the end, like this is not the end
