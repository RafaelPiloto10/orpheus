I remember holdin' on to you,  
All them long and lonely nights I put you through.  
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry,  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico  
One place I may never go in my life again.  
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
I only miss you every now and then,  
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean.  
Most Novembers I break down and cry,  
Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico,  
One place I will never go in my life again.  
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
No I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
Goodbye.  
Goodbye.
