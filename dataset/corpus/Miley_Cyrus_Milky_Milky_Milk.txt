[Intro]  
The milky, milky, milk  
The milky, milky, milk  
The milky, milky, milk  
The milky, milky, milk  
  
[Verse 1]  
The purple that is collapsing  
Head for the hills and prepare your intellect to flow  
The game of life is changing  
Man is about to awake  
Electric sun beams dancing in a liquid in my skull  
  
[Chorus 1]  
The milky, milky, milk  
Your tongue licking me so hard  
And from sucking on your nipples  
Licking milky, milky stars  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I feel like A slab of butter  
That is melting in the sun  
The presence melts away  
Now that you and me are one  
  
[Verse 2]  
Little [?] and the greatest truth appear  
That open up the [?] of the last 2 billion years  
I ask myself a question  
What the fuck is gone  
But I knew that I knew it  
From the milky, milky gods  
  
[Chorus 2]  
The milky, milky, milk  
Your lips get me so wet  
While I'm singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead  
  
[Bridge]  
The milky, milky, milk  
The milky, milky, milk  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
It's time to look [?]  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
It's time to look [?]  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
  
[Outro]  
I feel like a slab of butter  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
That is melting in the sun  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
The presence melts away  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
Now that you and me are one  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
Now that you and me are one  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
Now that you and me are one  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
Yeah, yeah
