Meet me in a restaurant  
Meet me on the top of the world  
Meet me and we'll talk the language of love  
  
I'll meet you anywhere you want  
I'll meet you on a ballroom floor  
Meet me and we'll float to a level above  
  
I wish you'd drop what you're doing  
And get on the case  
We could blow this existence  
Right out into space  
And share a sweet isolation  
Let's go there today  
Go today, go today  
Everyway, rightaway  
Oh let's go  
  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no more  
There's no way, there's no way  
No, no way  
  
Meet you on a mountain top  
Meet you at the end of the block  
As long as we can talk the language of love  
  
I'll take you in my arms again  
I'll take you to the edge of time  
Together we can reach for the heavens above  
  
I wish you'd drop what you're doing  
And get on the case  
We could blow this existence  
Right out into space  
And share a sweet isolation  
Let's go there today  
Go today, go today  
Everyway, rightaway  
Oh let's go  
  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I want your love  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I'm saying  
Take your cue from me now  
I'm saying baby, let's go  
Will you listen to me  
I'm saying baby, come on now  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no more  
There's no way  
  
Meet me on the dance floor and we'll dance to the rhythm  
Get you feet in motion and we'll dance to the rhythm  
Dance to the rhythm  
Dance to the rhythm of love  
  
Oh,baby  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I want your love  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I'm saying  
Take your cue from me now  
I'm saying baby, let's go  
Will you listen to me  
I'm saying baby, come on now  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no more  
There's no way
