I am a man who looks after the pigs  
Usually I get along okay.  
I am man who reveals all he digs,  
Should be more careful what I say.  
  
I'm getting put down,  
I'm getting pushed round,  
I'm being beaten every day.  
My life's fading,  
But things are changing,  
I'm not gonna sit and weep again.  
  
I am man who drives a local bus  
I take miners to work, but the pits all closed today.  
It's easy to see that you are one of us.  
Ain't it funny how we all seem to look the same?  
  
We're getting put down  
My karma tells me  
You've been screwed again.  
If you let them do it to you  
You've got yourself to blame.  
It's you who feels the pain  
It's you that feels ashamed.  
  
I am a young man  
I ain't done very much,  
You men should remember how you used to fight.  
Just like a child, I've been seeing only dreams,  
I'm all mixed up but I know what's right.  
  
I'm getting put down
