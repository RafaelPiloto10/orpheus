You came along for a weekend  
But you only stayed for one night  
You took off your hair, you pulled out your teeth  
Oh I almost died of fright  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck  
  
You said you were a virgin  
Full of promise and mystery  
But I knew that you would bring me down  
'Cos everyone calls you big G  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck  
  
You said you're gonna love me  
You said you're gonna set me free  
But I knew that you would bring me down  
And cause me misery  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck
