I'm waiting for my man, 26 dollars in my hand  
Up to lexington 125  
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Hey, white boy, whatyou doing uptown  
Hey, white boy, you chasing our women around?  
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest of my mind  
L'm just lookin for a dear, dear friend of mine  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black,  
Beat up shoes and a big straw hat  
He's never early, he's always late  
First thing you learn is thatyou always got to wait  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Up to brownstone, up three flights of stairs  
Everybody' s pinnedyou but nobody cares  
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste  
Oh, then you gotta split  
Because he's got no time to waste, ah  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Baby don'tyou holler  
Darling don 'tyou bawl and shout  
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out  
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine  
Until tomorrow, but that's just another time  
I'm waiting for my man
