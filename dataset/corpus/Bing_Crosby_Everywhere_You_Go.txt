Everywhere you go sunshine follows you  
Everywhere you go skies are always blue  
Children love you they seem to know  
You bring roses out of the snow,  
The whole world says "hello"  
Everywhere you go  
  
(Cheeks like the roses,  
Teeth like the pearl,  
Eyes with the heaven's blue)  
  
You made me love you  
I'm in a whirl,  
  
(You wonderful, marvelous, beautiful girl)  
  
Everywhere you go sunshine follows you  
Everywhere you go skies are always blue  
Children love you they seem to know  
You bring roses out of the snow,  
The whole world says "hello"  
Everywhere you go  
  
(Children love you they seem to know)  
  
You bring roses out of the snow,  
The whole world says "hello"  
Everywhere you go  
  
(The whole world says "hello")  
  
"Hello"  
  
Everywhere you go  
  
(Everywhere you go)
