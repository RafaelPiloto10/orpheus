Please forgive me, I don't know what to say  
Except I'm sorry to scare you away from me  
I get crazy and don't know what I've done  
It's all hazy thought we were having fun  
Was it so bad  
You feel you had to leave me, baby?  
Now that you're gone  
I need to belong, believe me, baby  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider  
Baby's cryin' it's so cold in our place inside I'm dyin'  
We need the smile on your face don't need no money  
I don't need no girlfriends, want my daddy  
To love me again and again and again and  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider  
Sometimes honey I know I talk too loud  
Short temper I'm apt to cuss you, you  
I don't mean it, passion gets the best of me  
Still I love you and I feel like you love me too  
I would be so glad  
If you would reconsider and stay  
Reconsider, reconsider, reconsider  
If you walk out that door  
You betta reconsider this if you don't call me no more  
You betta reconsider, reconsider that, reconsider  
If you think you were lonely before  
you betta, reconsider, reconsider this  
That I changed the lock on this door  
You betta reconsider that if you stop payin' these bills  
You gotta reconsider I betcha somebody will  
You betta reconsider
