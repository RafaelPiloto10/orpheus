I don't believe a word they're saying  
What they're saying isn't true  
  
Everybody calls her bad girl (Bad bad girl)  
Everybody put her down (Bad bad girl)  
Why don't they take the time to understand  
She's looking for a love she's never found  
  
And it's only 'cause she's lonely (Bad bad girl)  
That's the way she got her name (Bad bad girl)  
All she did was look for someone to love  
And they put the girl to shame  
  
(Hey there she's not the girl for you)  
Well you don't know her like I do  
(Hey there listen to your friends )  
If you're gonna put her down, here's where our friendship ends  
  
I don't hear a word you're saying (Bad bad girl)  
She's the one I'm dreaming of (Bad bad girl)  
So don't you ever call her bad girl again  
'cause she's found someone to love  
  
(Hey there open up your eyes)  
All I see is just a pack of lies  
(Hey there she's gonna break your heart)  
I'm gonna listen to the rumours that you start  
  
I don't hear a word you're saying (Bad bad girl)  
She's the one I'm dreaming of (Bad bad girl)  
So don't you ever call her bad girl again  
'Cause she's found someone to love
