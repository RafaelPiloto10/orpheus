All my neighbors are fast asleep  
And I can't find anything to drink  
The McKenzie's drank all the grain alcohol  
So I'm headed down the street to first call  
Me and the Bads were staying up late  
Kitty and Victor got dropped from the plate  
But no one was contented with the Wednesday wassail  
So I said it's only four short blocks to first call  
Not a walk of shame it's a walk of pride  
Peoples goin' to work while we're getting cockeyed  
The sun's coming up and the drinks are goin' down  
So shut the fuck up and I'll get the next round  
  
6am, we'll start all over again  
No one applying the brakes  
We'll stop the sweats and the shakes  
We're gonna eat pickled egg  
We're gonna see Toby Jeg  
We're not gonna let sun light have effect on our fun  
  
It smells like bleach, adult diapers and mold  
And everyone around me over 60 years old  
But we're gonna share the next hour or two  
We all got each other and nothing better to do  
Irish coffee, and Irish car bomb  
A fat drunk Jew starts singing this song  
I take a closer look and the fat guy is me  
So I buy him a shot, and he buys me back three  
  
6am, we'll start all over again  
No one applying the brakes  
We'll stop the sweats and the shakes  
We're gonna eat pickled egg  
We're gonna hang with Dave Gregg  
We're not gonna let sun light help decide when we're done  
  
All my neighbors are fast asleep  
And I can't find anything to drink  
The Loved Ones drank all of my alcohol  
So I'm gonna be the very first one at first call.
