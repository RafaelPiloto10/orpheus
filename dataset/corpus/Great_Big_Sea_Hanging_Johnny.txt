(Traditional - Arr. Gbs)  
  
Well, they call me Hangin' Johnny  
Away boys, away  
Well, I never hanged nobody  
And it's hang boys, hang  
  
Well, first I hanged me mother  
Away boys, away  
Me sister and me brother  
And it's hang boys, hang  
  
Well, next I hanged me granny  
Away boys, away  
Well, I'd hang the Holy Family  
And it's hang boys, hang  
  
Well, I never hangs for money  
Away boys, away  
It's just that hanging's so bloody funny  
And it's hang boys, hang  
  
Oh, they calls me Hangin' Johnny  
Away boys, away  
Well, I never hanged nobody  
And it's hang boys, hang
