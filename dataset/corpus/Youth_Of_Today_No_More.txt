Meat eating flesh eating think about it  
So callous to this crime we commit  
Always stuffing our face with no sympathy  
What a selfish, hardened society so  
No More  
  
Just looking out for myself  
When the price paid is the life of something else,  
No More  
I won't participate  
  
We've got the power we've got the might  
To take whatever is in sight  
Not even worried, it's an unfair fight  
Well we've got a heart to tell us what's right  
  
Our numbers are doubling in 88  
'Cause the people are starting to educate  
Themselves their friends and their families  
And we'll have a more conscious society
