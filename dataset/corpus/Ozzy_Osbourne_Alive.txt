A child of a broken mind  
The fear that I hide behind  
I hate rejection  
It's the worst  
It gravely hurts me  
  
Living inside my head  
I feel like the living dead  
I need your affection  
It's the best  
It greatly helps me  
  
With my back against the wall  
Trying so hard not to fall  
I'm so tired of sleeping around  
Hopeless, in despair  
Don't know if I'm here or there  
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
You know I'm alive  
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
I don't want to die  
  
A head full of tragic schemes  
what keeps me alive is dreams  
I dream that someday  
I'll find the key that sets my mind free  
  
You may think I've lost control  
The man with the broken soul  
I'm not here to try and make excuses  
Just believe me  
  
With my back against the wall  
Trying so hard not to fall  
I'm so tired of sleeping around  
Hopeless, in despair  
Don't know if I'm here or there  
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
You know I'm alive  
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
I don't want to die  
Yeah  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
You know I'm alive  
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
You know I'm alive  
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
You know I'm alive  
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here  
  
But I'm still alive  
I don't have any plans to go anywhere  
You know I'm alive  
  
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here  
I don't want to die  
You know I'm alive  
You know I'm alive
