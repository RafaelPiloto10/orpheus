So, may I have your attention?  
Look in my direction,  
Here you'll see the sun never sets.  
No, we don't have to worry,  
Never in a hurry.  
One by one the stars go to bed,  
And I step into the spotlight again.  
  
Can't help myself,  
I've got to be,  
When lights are shining down on me.  
I want to feel the sun.  
So turn that walk into a run,  
Gonna bring the party when I come.  
Sing it out if you want to have some fun.  
  
And into the spotlight we will go,  
Follow me cause, baby, lifes a show.  
Into the spotlight you will see  
It's the only place to be.  
Cha, Cha, Cha  
  
Oh, musics like a magnet,  
The best thing on the planet.  
It's pulling us together again.  
So, lets cause a commotion,  
Sound waves on the ocean.  
Wake the and grab your best friend,  
Lets step into the spotlight again.  
  
Can't help myself,  
I've got to be,  
When lights are shining down on me.  
I want to feel the sun.

Sing it out if you want to have some fun.  
  
And into the spotlight we will go,  
Follow me cause, baby, lifes a show.  
Into the spotlight you will see  
It's the only place to be.  
  
Turn it up,  
If you're down hearted.  
Let the music,  
Get us started.  
Gotta let it go once in a while.  
  
Turn it up,  
There's nothing to it.  
When it's done,  
Well just redo it.  
Might as well have fun,  
Have fun in this life.  
  
Can't help myself,
