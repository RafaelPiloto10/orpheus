Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus  
Trust to take him at his word  
Just to rest upon his promise  
  
And to know thus faith the Lord  
Jesus, Jesus how I trust him  
How I've prove him more and more  
Jesus, Jeusus, precious Jesus  
Oh for grace to trust him more  
  
Yesu mo ta landa Nge  
Yesu mo ta landa Nge  
  
Oh how sweet to trust in Jesus  
Just to trust his cleansing blood  
And in simple faith to plunge me  
'Neath the healing cleansing flood  
  
Jesus I will trust in you  
Jesus I will trust in you  
  
Yesu mo ta landa Nge  
Yesu mo ta landa Nge  
Kitoko ku tula ntmina na Ysue  
Eh ku ndima ndiga Yandi  
Yandi me sila ntima ya mono  
Mono zaba ndiga Nge  
  
Yesu mo me tula ntima  
Nge kieleka konso lumbu  
Yesu yesu mfumu yesu  
Sakumuna beto landa nzambi  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Yesu mo ta landa Nge  
  
I am so glad I learned to trust thee  
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend  
And I know that thou art with me  
Will be with me to the end  
  
Nge me sila mtima na mono  
Nge me sila mtima na mono  
Yesu, Yesu  
Mo ta zinga ti Nge na bla  
Yesu, Yesu
