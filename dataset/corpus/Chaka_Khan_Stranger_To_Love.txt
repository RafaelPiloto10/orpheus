Take me, oh I need it now  
Shake me to love somehow  
I need warm embraces, yes I do  
I need smiling faces to look into  
I know that time erases the wounds of man  
  
Love is not all I crave  
I know there's a world to save  
But I've always done my best  
And I think I've passed every test  
  
But there's something about a brand new heart  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
I need a stranger to love  
Send me a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past behind  
My past behind, my past behind (mmm, my past)  
My past behind, my past behind  
  
I know that love may not come  
But if I can dream like everyone  
I'd dream the warming feelin' of an early spring  
I'd dream the magic elation a touch can bring  
I wanna capture the feelin of a newborn heart  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
Send me a stranger to love  
I need a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past--- behind......  
My past behind, my past behind, yeah yeah, yeah  
My past behind, my past behind  
  
Send me a stranger to love  
I wanna stranger to love, oh yeah  
Send me a stranger to love  
So I can leave my past, wanna throw it out the door......  
My past behind  
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby, my baby, yeah  
My past behind  
My past behind, my past behind  
  
I've been lookin' for a brand new mind  
There's somethin bout a brand new start
