I, I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
He'll only break ya  
Leave you torn apart, oh  
  
It's a quarter to three can't sleep at all  
You're so overrated  
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall  
And he wouldn't take it  
  
All that you want's under your nose, yeah  
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
He'll only break ya  
Leave you torn apart, oh  
I can't be no superman,  
But for you I'll be super human  
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight  
  
Oh now you're at home  
And he don't call  
Cause he don't adore ya  
To him you are just another doll  
And I tried to warn ya  
  
What you want, what you need  
Has been right here, yeah  
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Up, up and away  
I'll take you with me  
Up, up and away  
I'll take you with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight  
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight
