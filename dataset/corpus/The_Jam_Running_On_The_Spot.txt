I was hoping we'd make real progress -  
But it seems we have lost the power  
Any tiny step of advancement  
Is like a raindrop falling into the ocean -  
We're running on the spot - always have - always will?  
We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.  
Though we keep piling up the building blocks  
The structure never seems to get any higher  
Because we keep kicking out the foundations  
And stand useless while our lives fall down.  
I believe in life - and I believe in love  
But the world in which I live in - keeps trying to prove me wrong.  
  
Out in the pastures we call society  
You can't see further than the bottom of your glass  
Only young but easily shocked  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -  
  
Just like sheep - little lambs into the slaughter  
Don't fully grasp what exactly is wrong -  
Truth is you never cared - still -  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -  
  
Intelligence should be our first weapon  
And stop reveling in rejection  
And follow yourselves, not some ageing drain brain  
Whose quite content to go on feeding you garbage  
We're running on the spot - always have - always will?  
We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.
