Don't you wish that your kids all looked more fine?  
Do you feel that your guy's below your style?  
Animal slippers and a drink over Sunday mail  
Coffee teeth and a cigarette heart for sale  
Any minute now something's gonna happen  
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in  
  
Mailman, black umbrella  
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya  
Sure have looked better  
And ego kissing fools  
Are teaching your kids in private schools  
Crack another bottle, it's five  
  
Monday morning who could ask for more  
Smoking buds, got your friends all 'round next door  
  
Any minute now something's gonna happen  
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in  
  
Mailman, black umbrella  
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya  
Kudzu Cinderella.  
Them ego kissing fools  
Are teaching your kids in private schools  
Crack another bottle, it's five
