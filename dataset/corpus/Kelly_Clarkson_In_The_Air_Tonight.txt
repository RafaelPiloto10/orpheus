I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
  
... street lights, asking to think twice  
You don't wanna relax  
... the night, oh  
I just... walking in street lights  
Can you hear the  
  
Big city, bright lights,... ice  
Fall in love at first sight  
Shawty make me feel like right  
Here was where she was supposed to be  
Hold me,... to me  
... something taking over me  
I gotta get her she bad,  
She's so... my back  
Never met a girl made me feel like that  
No don't think... just found his match  
Feel it, hear it, emotion, feel it  
It's loving, it's spirit, it's sexual, feel it, come on  
  
Starting to loose life I don't wanna loose sight  
Think I will fight things...  
Just wanna be lost in  
...  
Walking in the street lights  
Can you hear the  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
  
Now that I got her, I'm singing...  
... baby leaving with me  
... come on move it  
... hold it, just leave it, come on  
  
... street lights, asking to think twice  
You don't wanna relax  
... the night, oh  
I just... walking in street lights  
Can you hear the  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
I can hear it calling in the air tonight  
Can you hear the...  
My body is... , I hear it calling you  
My body is... , I hear it calling you
