[Slimm]  
I'm about two and a quarter from rocking the bird  
And about a G short from choppin' the third  
Now I'm sitting at the light with ten pounds of herb  
Uh oh, there they go, the Red Dogs swerve  
Jumped out, "Man, damn, they got nerve."  
Got the hell on, dropped everything including my word  
Now it's off through the woods we go, here we go  
Tossing the greens and blow, oh no!  
Dipping through the trails, running from twelve  
Everybody gotta lay low, shhhhhh!  
Escape routes major, elite street rollers  
Shit, we doper than cola, straight from Ayatollah  
A-Town heat strokers, flaming like the devils poker  
Two of the best wit it, hot shit, we'll roast ya  
If it's beef I'll choke ya and leave you for the vultures  
Or we can keep it cool playboy and I'll toast ya  
  
[Hook:]  
Dirt work, nigga we don't play  
I got a couple on the tool and a few on the way  
(repeat)  
  
[Big Boi]  
Well it's the rippinest, wickedest mc, bustin hard up out the ginseng  
Tell more dope stories than a damn dope house dope fiend  
Fuck the police, you know me  
These hoes blow me slowly, seems like they owe me  
Show me the dope don't worry about the cash  
Or your girlfriend's gonna be lonely, homey  
These rich and these vegetables feeling bony  
Don't make me open my book bag and you under scaling on me  
You understand me Tony, you look like you wanna go on a boat  
But you know I'll leave you bloating or floating  
Like sailboats and ltd's. Private, please  
I'm the nigga that earned his street stripes  
And they've seen me in the Source Magazine  
So you can't even pass me three mikes  
You get three strikes and about a half of clip of bullets, so run it  
And we can go on and get our little prices up  
And act like we was on that Teen Summit  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Slimm]  
I'm about a four and a half into working these slabs  
And about a hundred away from back in the lab  
Now I done bust the next batch down and my face looking drab  
Uh oh, yep, this nigga done served me some bab  
Me sad? Naw, mad. Quick to bust your ass  
Playing around wit a hustler's cash, they'll find ya stankin in the trash  
And escape wit your Billy Jean and thriller, cause I'm bad  
Who dat, them niggas wit the juice pack, you thought you had  
Naw dad, I'm glad my niggas keep a few thangs, wit a few mags  
Down to toe tag, drop bags, switch tags, and haul ass  
Smash till we out of gas, blast only if we gotta blast  
Turn sunny days into an overcast  
Abusive to the under class, when my tongue lash  
And I mash out wit Outkast. Yeah..!  
  
(Hook x3 to fade)
