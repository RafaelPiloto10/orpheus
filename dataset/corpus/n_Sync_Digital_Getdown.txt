Baby, baby get nasty, nasty  
and we can get freaky deaky  
  
Baby, baby, we can do all that we want  
We're gettin' nasty, nasty, we're getting freaky, freaky  
Baby, baby, we can do more than just talk  
'Cause I can hear ya, hear ya, and I can see ya, see ya  
Baby, baby we can do all that we want  
We're getting nasty, nasty, we're getting freaky, freaky  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Digital, digital get down (get down) just you and me  
(You may be) Twenty thousand miles away, but I can see ya  
And baby, baby you can see me  
Digital, digital get down (get down) just what we need  
We can get together naturally  
(We can) We can get together on the digital screen  
  
Every time I'm sittin' home alone girl  
I can't wait to get you on the phone girl  
So, pick it up, babe  
I can see everything you do  
Bouncin' me from satellite to satellite  
I love the things you do for me so late tonight  
So turn me on, yeah  
It's like I'm right there next to you, yeah  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Can we get connected?  
I need some love and affection, baby  
I'll call you on the phone  
I hope that I get through  
If you're in the mood and on the phone,  
here's what you do: leave a message  
You know the kind I like to get back to  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
Yeah  
  
I lose my mind just when you're speaking  
I see you on the screen, I get to freaking  
So, get down, babe  
And I'll get down for you  
I get so excited when I'm watching, girl  
I can't wait to see you touch your body, girl  
It's just me and you  
So, we can do what we gotta do (yeah)  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
Digital, digital, digital, digital get down (get down)  
Digital digital digital digital get down (get down)  
  
Baby, baby we can do more than just talk  
'Cause I can hear ya, hear ya, and I can see ya, see ya  
Baby, baby we can do all that we want  
We're getting nasty, nasty, we're getting freaky, freaky  
Baby, baby we can do more than just talk  
'Cause I can hear ya hear ya, and I can see ya, see ya
