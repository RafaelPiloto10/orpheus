Oh, I can't find a way to keep pretending  
I'm doin' alright on my own  
And I can't find the strength to keep believin'  
That you'll ever come back home  
But I'm tryin' to put this behind me  
And I've been cryin' more than you know  
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me  
Oh, I'm dyin' 'cause I can't let go  
And I can't find a way to keep pretending  
Well, I'm doin' alright on my own  
And I can't find the strength to keep believin'  
That you'll ever come back home  
Oh, your perfume still lingers all around me  
In our bedroom where I loved you so  
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me  
Oh, I'm dyin' 'cause I can't let go  
I'd be lyin' to say this won't kill me  
Oh, I'm dyin' 'cause I can't let go
