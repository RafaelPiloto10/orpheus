[Chorus: x2]  
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"  
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"  
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"  
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!  
  
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span  
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'  
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'  
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
'Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin' the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' "Freeze!"  
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots, they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out  
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out  
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,  
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up  
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up  
Stole her car, made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on "Set it Off" did  
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal  
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though  
Parents screamin', "Son, go in and call the police  
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "truce truce!"  
(Don't shoot!) Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasn't me!  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps  
  
[Chorus: x2]
