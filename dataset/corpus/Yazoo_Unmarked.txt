Go and join the army  
Said the father to the son  
See the world around you boy  
And learn to use a gun  
Think you're something special  
Well, we'll make you just the same  
There's nothing wrong in dying  
After all, it's just a game  
Just a game.  
  
Read the morning paper  
There's a picture of a cross  
"we were proud in them days"  
By the way, I think you lost  
Trust me when I tell you boy  
That god is on our side  
Even Jesus cheers us on  
Against the other side  
Against the other side.  
  
He who shouts the loudest  
Is the one who's in control  
We who never listen  
Are the ones who pay the toll  
Tell us that it's time at last  
To make a final stand  
I'm glad 'cause all I wanted  
Was to kill another man  
Just to kill another man.
