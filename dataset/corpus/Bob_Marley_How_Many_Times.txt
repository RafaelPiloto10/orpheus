Doo, do-do-wop, choo-whop, choo-wop  
How many times I've told you I love you?  
But now you want to say that we are through  
What more can I do?  
What more can I say to you?  
Now you're gone  
Do you remember that first night we met?  
That was a moment I never will forget  
Love was at first sight  
You came walking through the pale,  
Pale moonlight  
Pale moonlight  
Do you remember that first night we met?  
That was a moment I'll-ahh never will forget  
Love was at your first sight  
You came walking through the p-p-pale, p-p-pale,  
Pale moonlight  
Pale moonlight  
Doo, do-do-wop, choo-wop, choo-wop  
Doo, do-do-wop, choo-wop, choo-wop  
Doo, do-do-wop, choo-whop, choo-wop  
Doo, do-do-wop, choo-whop, choo-wop  
(until fade)
