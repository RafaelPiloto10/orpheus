I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
As you once heard  
  
I just want to go somewhere  
And hold you in my arms  
I just want to go somewhere  
To sort things on my own  
  
But it's following  
A dream  
That reminds me  
To believe it when I say  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
But we'll lay down now  
Making sure we put these words  
Between us  
  
Maybe I can go somewhere  
And be the only one  
Maybe I can make you think  
That I'm the only one  
That's left to say  
That I was wrong  
That you've been right  
About everything all along  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
But we'll lay down now  
Making sure we  
Put these words between us  
Don't put these words  
Between us  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
But we'll lay down  
We'll lay down  
Before we come  
To regret our fate  
And I'll push them down  
And I'll push them down  
On the floor between us  
  
I lie awake  
Because I'm scared  
I'm not as fake  
As you once heard  
And we'll lay these words  
And we'll put them down  
On the floor between us  
Don't put these words between us  
Don't put these words between us
