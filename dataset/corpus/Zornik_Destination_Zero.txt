And after many hours,  
We don't know where we're going,  
I fear it's destination zero  
And it's so hard to please you,  
To say the words that ease you.  
But I will always go my own way  
This was already known  
But never really shown  
I know it''s destination zero  
But have you really tried,  
I know that I was I  
But now I'm falling even harder  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
Wave me goodbye  
Save me tonight  
Take me away  
Just turn it around  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me
