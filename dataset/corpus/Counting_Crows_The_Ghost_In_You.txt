A man in my shoes runs a light  
All the papers lie tonight  
But falling over you  
Is the news of the day  
  
Angels fall like rain  
And love, is all of heaven way  
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade  
The ghost in you she don't fade away  
  
The race is on, I'm on your side  
But hearing you my engines died  
I'm in the mood for you  
Or for running away  
  
All the stars come down in you  
But love, love, love you can't give it away  
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade  
The ghost in you she don't fade  
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away  
Don't you know she don't fade  
  
Don't you go it makes no sense  
And all these talking supermen  
Just take away the time just to get it away  
Ain't it just like the rain  
Cause love, love, love, love is only heaven away  
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade  
The ghost in you she don't fade away  
  
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away  
The ghost in you she don't fade  
  
A man in my shoes runs a light  
But all the papers lie tonight  
Falling over you is the news of the day  
And love will not fade away  
And love love love will not fade away
