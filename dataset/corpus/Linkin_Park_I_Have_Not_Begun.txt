Maybe's a chance I've already keep y'all waitin'  
This goes out to everybody still hatin'  
For those that fake y'all can keep on fakin'  
Pokin' a plate for you to sink your whole face in  
Taste good only 'cause it's just so you know it's nothin'  
I getchu buggin' like tabooie and some robutussin  
It's just the way that I notions time I slap the track  
And turn around and choke each rhyme, pyrochlast  
To the nation like NPC, with pairs of 60's like an MPC  
To letter an ass woopin' via mp3,  
Givin' you people more reality than MTV  
Do a PPV snap necks with the pressure mega mess  
To carry you out on a stretcher  
You consume the ewl the law won't protect ya  
Even the courtroom sketcha can out sketch ya  
And now followin' me, got your number on column  
A D try you can holla with me, approach the pain  
I'ma check the body in threes, you can sittin' there stuttering  
Pr-probably, follow me,  
  
[Hook]  
I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
Here's news for you f-cka that cannot be done  
You can look and eye it pissed I have not begun  
  
Alcoholic, police close to bat,  
You think you're hard muh'f-cka'? you're an easter egg  
You gotta past at shell with a soft inside  
Squash your pride you think I f-ckin' lost my mind?  
I'm not playin'. I might as well be makin' a bomb  
I'm layin' down a foundation when I'm takin' you on  
Bet the fall of the rhyme for the sake of my mom  
She's like "Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on"  
It's funny but don't laugh, money with no cash  
The real of the vocab, killin' is no path  
The realest to romat, don't even know half  
I'm rankin' a full tank you're runnin' on low gas  
  
[Hook]  
Take that, crack off your fund,  
You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim and none  
You can take it I have finished I have not begun  
  
Gotta razor blade tongue  
And I kid this done  
No wonder just dumpin' on your crew for fun  
Machine stop got it locked like the game's a joke  
Say summin' funny get the whole gang to vote  
Let 'em pucka now f-cka go get your own  
We've been roamed ten years since we did this note  
The people on the block start to get numb  
They expect it it's fresh when the new sh-t come  
It grows, let 'em know they can fix around  
Railroad, rap hot tracks one and you're down  
And they're askin' repeat how I do this now  
Like I'm really gonna tell 'em how I get this sound  
We just doin' what we do gettin' from that place  
We come in the back like we're on this b-tch  
Turn the lights down low when we start this show  
What, you two get me right back in the go  
  
[Hook]  
It's take that, take that, cuttin' if your fun  
You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim to none  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun  
  
Follow me I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
But I got news for you f-cka that cannot be done  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun
