There was a time  
I used to think  
That love would never turn into reality  
I never thought  
I'd find the one  
But I tell I'm drawn to you a strength of none  
  
You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are  
Your love is like a shooting star  
So they can try but they can't touch (touch)  
You gotta look up to us  
  
Cause your love is outta this world (oooh)  
And you bring me down to earth  
I love how you put me first (oooh)  
Make me feel my every word  
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you  
I keep sayin you know this is about you  
It must be  
This is about you  
I never felt this way  
I know this be a song about you  
Forever, everyday  
I know this be a song about you  
  
I'll be your moon  
I'll make it bright  
And when it's dark I promise that you'll see the light  
And just as far as the moon from the summer sun  
That's how long that I'll be here  
And it's because  
  
You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are  
Your love is like a shooting star  
So they can try but they can't touch  
You gotta look up to us  
  
Cause your love is outta this world (oooh)  
And you bring me down to earth  
I love how you put me first (oooh)  
Make me feel my every word  
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you  
I keep sayin, you know this is about you  
It must be  
This is about you  
I never felt this way  
I know this be a song about you  
Forever, everyday  
I know this be a song about you  
  
In my sky  
We're the stars  
I'm on bliss  
You're all mine  
Hear my plan  
Understand  
I want you come into my mend, yeah  
  
In my sky  
We're the stars

You're all mine

And you bring me down to earth  
I love how you put me first (oooh)  
Make me feel my every word  
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you  
I keep, sayin you know this is about you  
It must be  
This is about you  
I never felt this way
