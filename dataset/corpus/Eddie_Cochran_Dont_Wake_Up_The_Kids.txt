Ma and pa, now here you all go again  
Givin' a party tryin' to impress your friends  
We been tryin' to figure what you spent  
This party must have cost a pretty cent  
Howlin', rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Sssh, don't wake up the kids please  
Look at them doin' that ol' time jitterbug  
Tearin' up a brandnew livingroom rug  
And when they find that hole burned in the chair  
You'd swear with all your might we put it there  
Howlin'. Rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Sssh, don't wake up them kids you all  
Thinkin' there was a recession goin' on  
What you gonna do when all your loot is gone  
You call all four of us a bunch of cranks  
When we don't let you rob our piggy banks  
Howlin', rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Don't wake up them kids you all please  
  
Wah, all the kids are peekin' through the crack  
The baby found a cushion in the back  
From the way he looked we got a hunch  
He must have got a hold of some of your punch  
Howlin', rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Sssh, don't wake up the kids, don't wake up the kids  
Help your parents and all you grab a broom  
While we do that dirty living room  
And don't you make no noise while you sweep  
You know your father's ill, he's tryin' to sleep  
Howlin', rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Rack 'em back, let 'em stack, runnin' around again  
Hey you all, don't wake up them kids in there
