Hold on dear brother  
Oh brother  
Ooooo  
  
Tried to close my eyes  
To all around me  
Oh no you just can't escape  
If I lose one friend  
Will I still have you  
  
Won't you please  
Hold on dear brother

What can I love that isn't you  
But you never understand inside of me  
Till you realize a look  
You never get more than you took  
  
Won't you please  
Hold on dear brother  
Hold on dear brother

A simple feeling that you shout  
I want your love  
You touch my hand  
I need your love  
To carry me home
