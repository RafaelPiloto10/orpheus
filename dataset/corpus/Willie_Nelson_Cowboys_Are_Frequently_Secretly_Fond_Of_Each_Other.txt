Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)  
Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas.  
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend.  
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes.  
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  
And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine.  
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.  
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women.  
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.  
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?  
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his
brother.  
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper.  
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead.  
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister.  
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.
