[Verse 1: Niall]  
When I'm fat and old  
And my kids think I'm a joke  
Because I move a little slow when I dance  
  
[Hook: Liam]  
I can count on you  
After all that we been through  
Cause I know that you'll always understand  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No I'll still feel the same around you  
  
[Verse 3: Louis]  
When I'm fat and old  
And my kids think I'm a joke  
Because the stories that I've told  
I tell again and again  
  
[Hook: Zayn]  
I can count on you  
After all we got up to  
Because I know that you'll truly understand  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same around you  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling out  
We'll still stay up 'til morning  
We'll throw an after party  
Oh yeah, oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same around you  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too
