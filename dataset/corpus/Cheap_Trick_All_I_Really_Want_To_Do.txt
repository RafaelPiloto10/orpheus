I'm in the right place just at the wrong time  
Oh, what am I gonna do?  
She left her name but she left no number  
Oh, what am I gonna do?  
  
I'm in the thick of it no one to turn to  
Let me explain [what I mean to do]  
Coming and going and going and coming  
I'm going to be coming the better I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
All I really wanna do is love you (ooh, ooh)  
Open up your heart and let me love you (ooh, ooh)  
I can't help it I can't stop it  
I can't keep my heart from saying  
All I really want to do is love you (ooh, ooh, ah yeah)  
  
I let her in but she couldn't stay well  
Oh what am I gonna do?  
I said the right thing just at the wrong time  
Don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
Coming and going and going and coming  
I'm going to be coming the better I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(chorus repeat to fade)
