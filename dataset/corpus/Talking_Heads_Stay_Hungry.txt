I think that we can signify our love now,  
Ooh girl, you can initiate an impulse of love.  
  
Stay hungry, stay hungry, stay hungry  
Move a muscle, move a muscle, move a muscle.  
Make a motion, make a motion, make a motion.  
Pull it tighter, pull it tighter, pull it tighter.  
Double beatin', double beatin', double beatin'  
Double beatin', double beatin', double beatin'  
Palpitation, palpitation, palpitation.  
Stay hungry, stay hungry, stay hungry.  
  
Here's that rhythm again.  
Here's my shoulder blade.  
Here's the sound I made.  
Here's the picture I saved.  
Here I am.
