Shaggy:  
The end is coming!  
Repent now or forever burn!  
The end of the world is here,  
The signs are everywhere!  
It's alllll over!  
  
Violent J:  
Holy f-ck it's hot outside, extra hot  
The sun is closer then it's ever got  
The sky's polluted, it's raining crud  
Pandemonium throughout the hood  
Every hour the planet shakes  
Buildings collapse from the earthquakes  
Freeways are packed, horns are blowing  
Nobody really knowing where the f-ck they're going  
  
Tidal waves swallowing the shores  
Coffins pushing up through your floors  
It's suddenly freezing, we fall to peices  
Pray for allah and call to Jesus  
Some stay home and hold their wives  
Others flip out and end their lives  
Me, I climb the roof of my house  
Spread my arms out, and sing  
  
It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]  
  
Huh, walking along my path  
The city has morphed into a blood bath  
Some are looting, others shooting  
The devil's in the sky and he's recruiting  
  
Tornados twisting through downtown  
Throwing buses and trucks around  
It's snowing, hailing, and burning up  
I rock my headphones and turn'em up  
Folks dying, crying, dead and crawlin  
Run to the curch, can't fit 'em all in  
Watch the groundscape crack in half  
A bottemless pit down Gratiot ave  
Some stay home and welcome death  
Appreciating each additional breath  
Me, I climb the roof of my house  
Spread my arms out, and sing  
  
It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]  
  
Fire, Ice, Lava, Winds  
Hurricanes, Earthquakes  
Taking it all in (Boom! Pow!) [x3]  
  
Acid rain, lighting, sin  
Earth shattering  
Taking it all in (Boom! Pow!) [x2]  
  
Boulders f-cking fall from the sky  
Death with no clue when or why  
The sun explodes and we absorb it  
Our planet spins right out of orbit  
Aliens show up and eat mankind  
A virus spreads with no cure to find  
God has had enough of our shit  
A nuclear war breaks out and that's it  
  
To be on this planet living your life  
To see it all end would be alright  
You can't complain, you wouldn't die alone  
You can die with loved ones and die at home  
And you're not missing anything when you're gone  
Plus seeing it all end and what goes on  
To see this great world come to an end  
Would be the next best to seeing it begin  
  
It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]  
  
Implosions!  
Explosions!  
Corrosion!  
Burnt up and frozen!  
The sky is falling!  
The gods are calling!  
It's all appalling!  
This shit we alllll in!
