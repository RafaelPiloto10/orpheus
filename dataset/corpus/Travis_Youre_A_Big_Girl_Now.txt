Our conversation was short and sweet  
It nearly swept me off-a my feet  
And I'm back here in the rain  
Oh and you are on dry land  
  
You made it there somehow  
You're a big girl now  
Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence  
He's singin' a song for me at his own expense  
  
And I'm just like that bird  
Oh singin' just for you  
I hope that you can hear  
Hear me singin' through these tears  
  
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast  
Oh, but what is the use of changing if all we've shared can't last  
I can change, I swear  
Oh see what you can do  
  
I can make it through  
You can make it too  
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase  
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days  
  
Oh, I know I can find you  
Oh in somebody's room  
It's a price I have to pay  
You're a big girl all the way  
  
A change in the weather is known to be extreme  
What's the use of changing horses in midstream  
I'm going out of my mind  
Oh with a pain that stops and starts  
  
Like a corkscrew to my heart  
Ever since we've been apart
