Oh, yeah  
Let the band play one time now  
It was early one morning,  
I was on my way to school  
Early one morning,  
I was on my way to school  
Got lost on Monday morning,  
I broke my teachers rule  
I was in love with you, baby,  
Before I learned to call your name  
I was in love with you, baby,  
Before I learned to call your name  
Now you're in love with someone else  
You're bound to drive poor me insane  
Oh, yeah ( )  
I said bye, bye bye, baby, bye bye  
I said bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
Ha ha  
I said bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
Bring it down here  
I said bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
Bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
I said bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
Yeah,  
Bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
Bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...  
I said bye, bye bye, baby, bye, bye ...
