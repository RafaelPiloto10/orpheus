We had our day but now it's over  
We had our song but now it's sung  
We had our stroll through summers clover  
But summer's gone now, our walkin's done  
  
So tell me gently who be your lover  
Who be your lover after I'm gone  
Will it be the moon that hears your sighin'  
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome song  
  
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom  
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair  
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning  
Will a rose be in your arms when I find you waitin' there  
  
None but the rain should cling to my bosom  
None but the moon should hear my lonesome sigh  
None but the wind should warn of your returning  
Fare thee well, my love, good-bye
