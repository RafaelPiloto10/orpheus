Hey! I ain't looking at you  
For no particular reason  
It doesn't inspire for me to be in  
I gotta open that door  
Hey, I gotta get it open hey  
I'm breaking way through, just like the robber  
And smile for the camera  
Damn, I feel awesome!  
But she doesn't know more  
Gotta get it opened!  
  
You never listen when I need someone to talk to  
So you switch the subject  
Cause, cause it's beyond you  
When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included  
I need to stop sleeping on myself  
Wake up and do it on my own!  
I found a way, yeah  
And I'll do it on my onw, hey!  
I can do anything, yeah  
And I'll do it on my own  
  
Can't you get it done with the help of no one  
I came to this word by myself  
So I don't need nobody else!  
We have just begun,  
So much to do, so young  
Don't be afraid of alone  
You'll get it done on your own!  
Uh, uh, uh!  
  
I know you're in there  
Open up, open up!  
Just like the feds, looking for the stuff  
Three knocks at the door  
I gotta get it open!  
I'm so confused with all the traffic  
I'mma skip the line  
Who cares what happens  
I gotta stay on that course  
I gotta get it open!
