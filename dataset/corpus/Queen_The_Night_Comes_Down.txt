When I was young it came to me  
And I could see the sun breakin'  
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling  
Holding the world inside  
Once I believed in ev'ryone  
Everyone and anyone can see  
  
Oh oh the night comes down  
And I get afraid of losing my way  
Oh oh the night comes down  
Oooh and it's dark again  
  
Once I could laugh with ev'ryone  
Once I could see the good in me  
The black and the white distinctively coloring  
Holding the world inside  
Now all the world is grey to me  
Nobody can see you gotta believe it  
  
Oh oh the night comes down  
And I get afraid of losing my way  
Oh oh the night comes down  
Oooh and it's dark again  
And it's dark again  
And it's dark again
