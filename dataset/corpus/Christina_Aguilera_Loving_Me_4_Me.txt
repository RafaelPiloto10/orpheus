People ask if I'm in love with you  
Because I'm sitting here with your picture  
And smiling to myself  
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you  
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through  
And I blush as I say yes  
  
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me  
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak  
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being  
With abilities to set me free  
Free, make me be me  
Makes me want to say  
  
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss  
I must admit it's a part of me  
You please me, complete me, believe me  
Like a melody  
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof  
We were meant to be  
But the best quality that's hookin' me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
  
People ask why I'm in love with you  
Well, let me start by saying  
You got my heart by just being who you are  
And what we got is between me and you  
It doesn't matter about the money I make  
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star  
  
Unconditionally you're there for me  
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet  
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable  
The way I feel, so sweet  
Makes me want to say  
  
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss  
I must admit it's a part of me  
You please me, complete me, believe me  
Like a melody  
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof  
We were meant to be  
But the best quality that's hookin' me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
  
Its so amazing how something so sweet  
Has come and rearranged my life  
I've been kissed by destiny  
Oh, heaven came and saved me  
An angel was placed at my feet  
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me  
  
Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes  
No cover ups, push ups  
With him, I don't have to put on a show  
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin  
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in  
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me  
Yeah
