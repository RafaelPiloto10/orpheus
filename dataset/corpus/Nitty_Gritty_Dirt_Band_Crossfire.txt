You wanted to be street wise  
Went and got involved  
Now you're trapped and helpless  
Problems you can't solve  
One side and the other  
There's no shelter  
In a crossfire  
Had to play with big boys  
Grew up much too fast  
They ran and left you  
Facing things you can't resist  
Better keep your head down  
Finally had your showdown  
Crossfire  
You and I  
Friends long gone  
Lies on lies  
On and on and on  
You and I  
Bridges burn  
Lies on lies  
Who's gonna rescue you  
Tell me who's gonna  
Who's gonna wear the bleeding heart  
Put it on the line  
When you gonna pay attention  
Sentence fits the crime  
Can't hold out much longer  
Shots are coming closer  
Crossfire  
And it's one side and the other  
There's no shelter  
In a crossfire  
Oh it's one side and the other  
There's no shelter  
Crossfire, crossfire  
Crossfire, crossfire  
Crossfire, crossfire  
Crossfire, crossfire  
1, 2, 3, 4
