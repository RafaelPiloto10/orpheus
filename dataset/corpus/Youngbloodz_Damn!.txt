OK, OK, OK

You already know how we do it homeboy  
It's A-Town (105 Road for dem hoes)  
It's A-Town (east side for dem hoes), Attic Crew you already know  
Lil John, Eastside Boyz and yo boy Sean Paul let me tell ya like this here boy  
  
[Sean Paul]  
They callin' me to come back to the streets, Sean P. a.k.a Sharp Crease  
Said it was necessary, these sucka niggaz out here very scary  
They come from the hole they livin' in the month of February  
OK then put a sissy nigga on display then  
Kick in ya door and have my folk dem bring dem K's in  
I'm still Attic A-double T-I-see  
It ain't a hoe out there fo real who don't know 'bout me  
Bitch I'm fo sho wit it don't make me pop that trunk to the 'Lac  
Bitch I will go get it and I ain't selfish I will let you and your hoe feel it  
Won't catch me sippin' on no Cris and got a cold billy  
It's Youngbloodz A-Town malt liquor sippin', comin' straight from the gutter  
Toe-tag a motherfucker, leave 'em under a cover  
Lil John he drop the beat that make ya bounce like rubber  
Sean Paul he tote the heat to make ya mug then slug ya yeah  
  
[Chorus: Lil' Jon]  
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck  
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck  
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck  
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck  
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit  
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit  
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit  
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit  
  
[J-Bo]  
I post up get to it, drink hand in hand  
They call me Mr. Herringbone 'cause that's my right hand man  
Old school straight foolish like no other indeed  
With Lil John it's Youngbloodz they crunk as can be  
Attic Crew 105 that's if you lookin to rumble  
Cock back bust aim now I done got yo number  
In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer  
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder  
'cause in the Dirty we dem boys that drank you under the table  
Where dem niggaz pimp hoes in fly suits and gators  
In my Chevy so super I'm the one to call  
Just dial 1-800-430 slash ALCOHOL  
And dawg I'm not the one that you really just want to clown  
I'm cool in my way, but shit still I shut 'em down  
And piss on them haters J-Bo he cuts a fool  
In the cut 'bout slizzard somewhere that's how we do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Sean Paul]  
Out of town hard heads get swiss cheesed up  
And you gon' need more than stitches to patch that leak up  
Chump like me up my mouth TB'd up  
With the plush leather guts steady grippin' the butt  
Oh you fo sho with it, then pull yo pistol  
Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it  
And I ain't selfish I will let you and your folk feel it  
Talkin' big boy shit  
Me muggin' like a motherfucker my hand on my dick  
  
[J-Bo]  
'cause at a grip we keep it jumpin' like it ain't nuttin' new  
We started off with Shake Em Off so look up now oh guess who  
It's them boys from the bottom who took you down 85  
And hit you with that you-Way so don't be surprised  
We buckin' blowin' chillin' and sippin' on something good  
I'm peepin' out the scenery and wishin' a nigga would  
In case it just might pop I'm 'bout ready to lock and load  
To take you through the South to show you how we throw dem bows  
  
[Chorus]
