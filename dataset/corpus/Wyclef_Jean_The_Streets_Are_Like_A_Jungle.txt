One, two...  
One, two-One,two...  
Yo!  
  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
I'm countin' money in the jungle  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
I tip my derby like Zorro  
Ain't no such things as war heroes  
Frontline planes fly by, like the sparrow (BLAOW!)  
My face hits the dirt, flashbacks of Vietnam  
Remind me of the L.A. riots, when it was on  
Fire hits the street, neon lights are bright  
My tank cuts the corner, enemies take flight (That's right!)  
Make no mistake, you can't have this cake it took too long to bake  
and you can't carry this weight, so move on  
These are the words of the elders  
Babysitters got caught with cocaine in a baby's diapers  
Explain that, in the form of a rap  
She got caught with vals, A-CRACK-A-LACK-A-LACK!!!  
Now I'm upset, I get back to the projects  
First one I blast was a usual suspect, a fiend  
In the alley, named Ricky  
Talked to a Det. rookie, gave him the info  
About the paliquo, and where he gotta go  
All he want in return is a Sony stereo  
  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A Jungle  
I'm countin' money in the jungle  
Hey yo! The Streets Are Like A jungle  
Guns go off in the jungle  
  
Hey yo my mind is my business so I'm...  
Minding my own, in the club 'til this girl said,  
"Let me see your telephone"  
I passed her my celly  
She called her girl Mary  
And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in D.C.  
She needs a new honey, in the city she gets lonely  
I finally figured out her man's locked up in a penatentary  
So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?  
The devil said, "Clef, take her ass home!"  
God says, "Repect her, her man's in the pen"  
This kid pushed me from behind, "Yo, why you fuckin' with my woman?!!!"  
Then his girl looked at me, she winked! I blinked!  
Now he's coming up to me with the gorilla instinct  
Aww, cool-n-shit! I'm sittin' here eatin' shrimp  
Besides, I would hate for you to be a missing link  
He said, "Son, do you know who I am?! I'm no man, but one man  
who? The son of Sam!"  
I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song  
He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation  
Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock! He released!  
then breathe, His aim went off balance  
The music got tense  
That's when I knew I was in trouble! The street is like a jungle!  
I jumped behind the bar, but caught two in the ankle! POW! (Echo)
