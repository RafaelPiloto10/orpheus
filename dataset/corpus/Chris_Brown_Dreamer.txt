What do I do  
Stop...  
Go...  
Fail...  
Succeed...  
Live...  
Or Die  
I just got to believe  
  
Believe... it's worth saving  
And to get lost  
Lost in a day dream  
So why hesitate  
Take me to another place  
So far far away  
So I can get out of the dark  
High speed  
Like I'm racing  
Just like lightning  
The sky is blazing  
But you've lost your way  
You've been lead astray  
Are there better days  
For My Fallen Dreamer  
  
Calling The Dreamer  
A dreamer  
Calling The Dreamer  
A dreamer  
A dreamer  
You don't believe no more (you don't even sleep no more)  
Dream no more  
(You don't even dream no more)  
Dreamer, Dreamer  
Why Don't you Just Dream Again  
  
Believe  
In You  
You got something to prove  
You're a star  
Watch you shine bright  
On your way to the lime light  
Finish Line  
The sweat and tears  
You can channel all of your fears  
Open your eyes  
Your eyes  
Indeed will be alright  
  
Calling The Dreamer  
A dreamer  
Calling The Dreamer  
A dreamer  
A dreamer  
You don't believe no more (you don't even sleep no more)  
Dream no more  
(You don't even dream no more)  
Dreamer, Dreamer  
Why Don't you Just Dream Again
