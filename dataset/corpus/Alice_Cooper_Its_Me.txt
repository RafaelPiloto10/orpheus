You took a first-class trip to Paris  
You danced in the streets of Spain  
You followed the sun to Rio de Janeiro  
Cuz you got so sick and tired of the  
London rain  
But honey, late at night  
When you close your tired eyes  
You'll be there  
And I'll be here  
And one of us will cry  
  
It's me, it's me  
When you need something more  
Something you're dying for  
It's me, it's me  
When you can't see too clear  
Baby, I'm always near  
It's me  
  
You played your cards, you felt the sorrow  
'Cuz all that dealer dealt was pain  
But baby, where you gonna play tomorrow  
The stakes were too damn high  
And now, you're broke again  
You can trip around til all your money's blown  
But who's the man that'll take you in  
When all your luck is gone  
  
It's me, it's me  
What are you searching for  
I know you can find my door  
It's me, it's me  
I know you've sinned every sin  
But I'll still take you in  
It's me  
  
And me, I'm sitting here  
Nothing much has changed  
You broke my heart to pieces, babe  
But that's nothing strange  
Well, I ain't angry  
That's all come and gone  
My arms are still open wide girl  
To catch you when you fall  
  
And if someday you realize  
Just where you belong  
I'm the man that'll take you in  
When all your luck is gone  
It's me, it's me  
  
When you need something more  
Something you're dying for  
It's me, it's me  
When you can't see too clear  
Baby, I'm always near  
  
It's me, it's me  
What are you searching for  
I know you can find my door  
It's me, it's me  
I know you've sinned every sin  
But I'll still take you in  
It's me  
Yeah, baby, it's me
