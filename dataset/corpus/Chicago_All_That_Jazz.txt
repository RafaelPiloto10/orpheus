[Velma Kelly]  
Come on babe why don't we paint the town  
And all that jazz  
I'm gonna rouge my knees  
And roll my stockings down  
And all that jazz  
Start the car I know a whoopee spot  
Where the gin is cold  
But the piano's hot!  
It's justy a noisy hall  
Where there's a nightly brawl  
And all that jazz  
  
And all that jazz  
And all that jazz  
Slick your hair  
And wear your buckle shoes  
And all that Jazz  
I hear that Father Dip  
Is gonna blow the blues  
And all that Jazz  
Hold on, hon  
We're gonna bunny hug  
I bought some aspirin  
Down at United Drug  
I case you shake apart  
And want a brand new start  
To do that

Jazz  
  
[Velma Kelly]  
Find a flask  
We're playing fast and loose  
And all that jazz  
Right up here  
Is where I store the juice  
And all that jazz  
Come on, babe  
We're gonna brush the sky  
I bet you luck Lindy  
Never flew so high  
'Cause in the stratosphere  
How could he lend an ear  
To all that jazz?  
Oh, you're gonna see your sheba shimmy shake  
  
[Company]  
And all that jazz  
  
[Velma Kelly]

[Company]  
And all that jazz

Show her where to park her girdle  
Oh, her mother's blood'd curdle  
  
[Company]  
If she'd hear her baby's queer  
  
[Velma Kelly]  
For all that jazz  
  
All that jazz

The town?  
And all that jazz  
And all that jazz  
I'm gonna rouge my knees  
And roll my stockings down  
And all that jazz  
And all that jazz  
Start the car  
I know a whoopee spot  
Where the gin is cold  
But the piano's hot  
It's just a noisy hall  
Where there's a nightly brawl  
And all that jazz  
  
No, I'm no one's wife  
But, Oh, I love my life  
And all  
That  
Jazz!
