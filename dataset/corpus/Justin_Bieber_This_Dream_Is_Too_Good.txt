Let's go  
Fast Cars  
Downtown Movie Stars  
Candlelight  
Taking pictures every night  
(Taking pictures every night)  
In the mall  
Shopping sprees cause I thought  
Can't you see  
That this is where I want to be  
And It's all a dream  
I'm asleep I think  
In this bed dreaming  
Please don't wake me  
Cause this dream is to good  
This dream is too good  
This dream is too good  
This dream is too good
