[Chris: Talks]  
I Mean Come On...  
I Can't Deal With It...  
Call Me Back...  
  
Lately  
More and More I Been Feelin Some Kind Of Way  
And I Ain't Crazy  
I Know You Got Those Texts From Me  
(Got 'Em From Me, whoaa)  
But It's This Thing  
That We Been Goin Through  
Is Somethin Wrong With You? (With You)  
All It's Doing Is Makin Me Remember  
How We Called It Quits  
Girl I'm Too Young For This  
When You...  
  
When You Turned Away From Me  
Makes Me Think That I Should Jus Leave  
Go Back To Bein The Same Ol G  
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back  
Oh I...  
Don't Want You Mad At Me  
Snatchin The Covers  
Actin Like You're Asleep  
When You Know You're Up, nooo  
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back  
  
All Night Long  
I Find Myself Tryna Get Away  
And That Ain't Right, nooo  
Lookin Through My Phone  
Tryna Remember Her Name  
That Would Only Make It Worse  
We Try To Talk Through Our Problems  
But It Takes More Than Words  
Said It Don't Even Bother Me  
But I Swear It Hurts  
When I Said I Didn't Wanna Go Through The Same Ish  
This Is What I Meant, ohhh...  
  
When You Turned Away From Me  
Makes Me Think That I Should Jus Leave  
Go Back To Bein The Same Ol G  
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here Back To Back  
Oh I...  
Don't Want You Mad At Me  
Snatchin The Covers  
Actin Like You're Asleep  
When You Know You're Up, nooo  
Girl I Don't Wanna Lay Here, Back To Back
