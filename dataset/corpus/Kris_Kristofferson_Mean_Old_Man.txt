If I look like a mean old man that's what I am  
If I look like a mean old man that's what I am  
If I look like a mean old man  
Who'll do you any way he can  
To break your heart and kiss your hand  
That's what I am  
And if I look like a good old friend that's what I am  
If I look like a good old friend that's what I am  
If I look like a good old friend  
Who's good at bending with the wind  
To be your friend right to the end  
That's what I am  
Chorus:  
And if I look like a voodoo doll that's what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll that's what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll  
Who takes his licking standing tall  
Who'd rather bite you back than crawl  
That's what I am  
If I look like your uncle bob that's what I am  
If I look like your uncle bob that's what I am  
If I look like your uncle bob  
Who likes to slap you on the back and rob you  
While he still can do the job  
That's what I am  
Chorus:  
And if I look like a voodoo doll that's what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll that's what I am  
If I look like a voodoo doll  
Who takes his licking standing tall  
Who'd rather bite you back than crawl  
That's what I am
