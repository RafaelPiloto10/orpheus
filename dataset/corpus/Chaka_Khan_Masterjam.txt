It's a party invitation we're putting down  
So come on ya'll give it a chance  
Get up and dance  
Got to groove, get your body loose  
And join the band  
Help spread the word about the masterjam  
It's a soulful revolution that can't be beat  
We'll rerun the constitution and heat your feet  
So come on ya'll give it a chance  
Get up and dance  
Got to groove, get your body loose  
And join the band  
Help spread the word about the masterjam  
  
We got to wake up the world  
And change it all tonight  
Gonna spend it around and wake it up with part lights  
So forget about your troubles and live the...  
And rock the country and don't look back  
  
So come on ya'll give it a chance...  
We could rule the world with the Masterjam repeat)  
  
Come on take my hand, join the band  
Got to tell the world about the masterjam  
Got to tell the world, got to tell the world
