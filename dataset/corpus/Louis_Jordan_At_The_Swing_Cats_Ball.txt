Come on, get set for the party,  
Tomorrow night at the Swing Cats' Hall,  
Come on, let them send your body  
At the Swing Cats' Ball.  
No time to lose, please don't be tardy,  
Tomorrow night at the Swing Cats' Hall.  
Get in the groove with everybody  
At the Swing Cats' Ball.  
Some will shag while others drag,  
Some will bump while others jump.  
Park Avenue will do their swinging,  
Tomorrow night at the Swing Cats' Hall,  
You can't refuse to join in swinging  
At the Swing Cats' Ball.
