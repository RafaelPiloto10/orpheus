See you lost your trust and you never should have, you never should have.  
Don't break your back if you ever see this.  
Don't answer that.  
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed  
I'll be doing my best  
I'll see you soon.  
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends  
I'll see you soon.  
  
See, they came for you they came snapping at your heels, they came snapping at
your heels.  
Don't break your back if you ever see this.  
Don't answer that.  
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed  
I'll be doing my best  
I'll see you soon.  
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends  
I'll see you soon.  
  
You lost your trust  
You lost your trust  
No don't lose your trust  
No don't lose your trust
