She don't want nobody near  
But you can't get away from that  
They appear and disappear  
And they all get a string attached  
Pretty soon they got you hanging on a line  
Pretty soon they're singing one by one the same old rhyme  
They say, "I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight."  
  
She don't want nobody home  
'Cause it's a little too crowded then  
But she don't wanna be alone  
So they just keep pouring in  
Pretty soon they got her headed for the door  
She comes home to find that they're not hanging 'round no more  
She says "I'm alright, you just can't get home tonight."  
  
Don't you wonder what she looks like in the light?  
She says "I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight."  
  
Pretty whitewashed lies  
Endless alibis  
And the reasons that need cleaning every night  
Half a world away  
You can't wash away the stain of the deceiving  
And the things that you cannot believe, and well  
  
She don't want no one around  
'Cause she don't want anybody to see  
What she looks like when she's down  
'Cause that's a really sad place to be  
Pretty soon she gets them crawling up the walls  
Then she wonders why they beg her please to never call  
She says, "I'm ok. It's alright. Hey, look who's on TV tonight."  
She says, "I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight."  
  
Don't you wonder why it's dark outside at night?  
She says, I'm alright, I just can't get home tonight.
