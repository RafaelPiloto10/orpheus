Choices always were a problem for you.  
What you need is someone strong to guide you.  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow,  
What you need is someone strong to use you  
Like me,  
Like me.  
If you want to get your soul to heaven,  
Trust in me.  
Don't judge or question.  
You are broken now,  
But faith can heal you.  
Just do everything I tell you to do.  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.  
Let me lay my holy hand upon you.  
My God's will  
Becomes me.  
When he speaks out,  
He speaks through me.  
He has needs  
Like I do.  
We both want  
To rape you.  
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life.  
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now  
And your lies.
