Felt someone calling me into the howling of the wind.  
I heard the reflection of a sound echoing through my skin ...  
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on ...  
Through my wild heart ...  
Whispering to me the Sisters Of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...Sisters Of Avalon...  
  
She is awakening in dark swells and mystery.  
Unbridled night mares powerful and running free.  
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees...  
For the trampled flowers, the daughters of Eve, the Sisters of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...Sisters Of Avalon...  
  
They brought her in in a new white dress...  
But the stain left an ache on her mother's breast...  
Now all that's left are the ghostly steps from a distant corridor...  
  
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on ...  
Through my wild heart ...  
Whispering to me the Sisters Of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...  
Come on sisters...come on sister...
