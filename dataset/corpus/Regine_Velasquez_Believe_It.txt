If we could find  
Peace in our minds  
With each passing day  
If we could live  
Believin' in dreams and what we could have been  
  
If we just hold on  
There's just so much we can hope for in life  
If we just hold on  
There's so much more left for you and me  
  
All I know  
Believe it and you shall be  
Believe it so you can see  
A brighter day in this world we live upon  
Believe it now with me  
  
If we could wait  
  
For our place in the sun  
Then we could fly so high  
If we must bathe ourselves  
In the glow of sunlight all around  
  
If we just hold on  
There's just so much we can hope for in life  
If we just hold on  
There's so much more left for you and me  
  
And I know  
Believe it and you shall be  
Believe it so you can see  
A brighter day in this world we live upon  
Believe it now with (me)  
Us holdin' on together  
Pursuing our dreams to forever  
Never to stop living life though it seems  
  
All I know  
Believe it and you shall be  
Believe it so you can see  
A brighter day in this world we live upon  
Believe it now with me
