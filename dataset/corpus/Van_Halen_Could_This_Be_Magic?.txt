Out upon the islands on a cool summer night,  
Buddy, you don't got to hurry. Take your time.  
What you need is on the menu and you get it tonight.  
Buddy, you got women's on your mind.  
Could this be magic,  
Or could this be love?  
Could this turn tragic?  
You know that magic often does.  
And I see lonely ships upon the water.  
Better save the women and children first.  
Sail away with someone's daughter.  
Better save the women and children first.  
I hear music on the landin', and there's laughter in the air.  
Just could be your boat is comin' in.  
Yeah, you're leanin' back, and your foot's tappin' and you got your head
right.  
There's a full moon out tonight. Baby, let's begin.  
Could this be magic,  
Or could this be love?  
Could this turn tragic?  
You know that magic often does.  
And I see lonely ships upon the water.  
Better save the women and children first.  
Sail away with someone's daughter.  
Better save the women and children first.
