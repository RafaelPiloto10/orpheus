That girl sitting over there is defined as the world's finest Paramount
Pyramid.  
  
I met this  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
That kind of timing just isn't happening  
Not today, not on any day  
The flying party is here  
But the constellation is right  
For a lovely flight  
A special strategy for the warlocks to her  
And his magical flute will sing you the truth  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Flying party is here  
Zookeeper keeps her  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Zookeeper keeps her  
  
Hello James, the sun loves you  
Get your fear in gear  
The flying party is here  
Goodbye, I'm flying  
To meet brother monkey  
The timing just isn't happening, not today, not on any day  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Zookeeper keeps her  
Zookeeper, zookeeper, zookeeper  
The flying party is here  
Flying party is here  
Oh-oh  
Flying party is here  
My ?? prevalent battle-shipped
