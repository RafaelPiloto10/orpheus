You keep catching my eye  
And we keep looking at each other  
Is this what it feels like  
To be someone's lover  
There was never a time  
And the clock didn't matter 'til now  
And we could say that it's going well  
It feels like Hell  
Cause we walk and we talk  
And we're just like the others  
We touch and we move  
Buried treasure discovered  
And we've got no excuses at all  
Cause we're just like lovers  
This feels like I'm drowning  
In some desert of misery  
My heart lights up when I look at you  
You're the only thing I can see  
And we could say that it's going well  
And when I'm away it feels like Hell  
Cause we walk and we talk  
And we're just like the others  
We kiss hug and move  
All our secrets get uncovered  
And we've got no excuses at all  
Cause we're just like  
Some of the people never get to know  
What we're going through  
And if we're just good friends  
I want to know  
Why it feels like it's so much more  
Are we just like lovers  
I wanta know  
I wanta know  
Oh  
We're just like lovers  
We're just like lovers  
We're just like lovers  
We're just like lovers  
Windows break  
My life shatters  
Nothing seems to matter  
We are just like lovers  
We got more than we've ever  
Dreamt we could discover  
Cause we're just like one another  
We are just like lovers  
We are  
(Some other place some other time)  
(Some other place some other time)  
(Some other place some other time)  
Cause we're just like one another  
(Some other place some other time)  
(Some other place some other time)  
(Some other place some other time)  
(Some other place some other time)
