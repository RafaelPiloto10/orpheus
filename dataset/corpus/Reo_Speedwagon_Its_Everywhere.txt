Lookin' for a love  
Searchin' everywhere  
I can't get enough and I don't really care  
If it takes a lot of waitin'  
'Cause I've got the time to spare  
It's gonna take a lot more lovin'  
But we got plenty of that around here.  
  
Laughin' heading home a woman could be fine  
Flying back alone, I don't really mind  
'Cause it gives me the time for thinking  
How so many people just ruin their lives  
Folks miss out on so much lovin'  
By picking it up before it arrives.  
  
I can't see it but I know when it's there  
I can just feel it, it's everywhere  
I can't see it but I know when it's there  
I can just feel it, it's everywhere.
