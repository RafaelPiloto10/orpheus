Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?
