Love is the devil counting teardrops in the rain  
To the sound of a chalkboard symphony played with nails  
For what it's worth I don't wanna see you hurt anymore  
Than you have to  
  
[Chorus]  
Dine on glass, wine on blood  
Baby, love the hard way  
Baudelaire in Braille  
Baby, love the harder way  
Once you lose yourself entomb  
I promise you love the hardest way  
  
Pretty like a flower on a tomb you are kissed  
blue by the last arrows of your sun  
Olly olly oxen free  
Hide and go weep  
Oh, no more  
Unless you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love the hardest way  
Love the hardest way  
Love the hardest way
