Go, go, go, go  
  
You are my one and only  
But one can seem so fucking lonely  
Shut up, shut up, hear me out  
I got a bad habit I can't live without  
  
Something wicked this way comes  
Infidelity, infidelity  
It's only sex, I'm just having fun  
I'm the king of unaccountability  
  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
I had a guilty heart right from the start  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
It's ripping me apart  
  
My hands are tied  
With this feeling comes no conscience, do or die  
I'm content in misery, don't even try  
Understanding all this pain or reason  
Why I don't know, maybe you're to blame  
Go, go, go  
  
Yes, you are so blind it's easy  
Do anything just to try to please me  
Shut up, shut up, listen to what I say  
Time is running out, you should bail today  
  
Something wicked this way comes  
Guilt inside of me, guilt inside of me  
The king of pain I'm his only son  
I'll make you wish you never put your trust in me  
  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
A guilty heart right from the start  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
It's ripping me apart  
  
My hands are tied  
With this feeling comes no conscience, do or die  
I'm content in misery, don't even try  
Understanding all this pain or reason  
Why I don't know, maybe you're to blame  
  
Wake up, this is never gonna end  
Wait up, you're one in ten  
I'll break up your will within and straight up  
Do it all again  
  
If you wait up all night, I'll be burning daylight  
Me and my libido are in on the take, right?  
Break what I want, leave you by the wayside  
Promise I'll stop you can trust what I say, psyche  
When I'm on top you'll be droppin' down the scale like  
  
My hands are tied  
With this feeling comes no conscience, do or die  
I'm content in misery, don't even try  
Understanding all this pain or reason  
Why I don't know, maybe you're to blame  
Go, go, go  
  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder
