I got a problem I can't explain  
It's hard to solve it, I can't lose face  
They all try to help me, but I can't see the light.  
  
Me and my shadow are so in despair  
'Cause we keep hurtin' someone who cares  
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat  
There must be some way outta here, but I can't find it yet.  
  
I got a problem that's so intense  
I try to fight it, but there's no defense.  
  
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat  
There must be some way outta here, but I can't find it yet.  
  
I got a problem, I got a problem  
I got a problem, I got a problem  
Every time we talk about it I break out in a cold sweat.
