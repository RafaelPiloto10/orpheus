Keep your head up  
Try and listen to your heart  
Be kind always, no matter  
We all grow up  
And someday well say goodbye  
So shine your light while got one  
  
Make the most of what you've got  
Don't waste time being trying to be something you're not  
Fill up your head and fill up you heart and take your shot  
Don't waste time trying to be something you're not  
  
Once round just once so take your shot  
Don't waste time trying to be something you're not  
Fill up your head and fill up you heart cause that all we got  
Don't waste time trying to be something you're not  
  
Through you window  
That's one way to see the world  
Step outside and look back into  
Look and listen  
And you decide what to believe  
Shine your light while you got one  
  
And make the most of what you got  
Don't waste time trying to be something you're not  
Fill up your head and fill up your heart and take your shot  
Don't waste time trying to be someone you're not  
  
That's not a star that's a satellite  
Step it out  
Step it out  
  
That's not a star that's a satellite  
That's not a star that's a satellite  
That's not a star that's a satellite
