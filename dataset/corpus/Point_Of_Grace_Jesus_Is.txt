Words and music by connie harrington  
Speak a little softer so I can hear you  
Above the noise, the noise, the noise in this world, yeah  
You don't have to shout it for hearts to listen  
Just be a still, small voice, and let the truth be heard  
(chorus)  
That jesus is  
The way, the truth he is the light  
For me, for you, for the world tonight  
Our hope, the meaning of this life  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Everybody's looking, but how will they find it  
The road to happiness unless they're told  
That love is the answer to the ultimate question  
But how will they understand unless they know  
(chorus)  
The way, the truth, he is the light  
For me, for you, for the world tonight  
Our hope, the meaning of this life  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Jesus is
