She said, "You never tell me that you love me anymore  
So I can't help but wonder if you do?"  
She said, "If things don't change you'll see me walk right out that door  
'Cause I've done everything I know to do?  
I said, "I don't know just what it is you want from me?"  
She said, "I only want us back the way we used to be ?"  
Then she said  
  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
Hold me, hold me like you want me  
Like you'll never let me go?  
She said, "Show me that you really love me"  
And then tell me  
'Cause I really need to know?  
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me?"  
  
I got down on my knees right there and I promised her I'd change  
'Cause deep inside I knew that she was right  
I said, "I know we've drifted and there's only me to blame"  
But I don't want to waste another night?  
And somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start  
As I took every word she whispered straight to heart  
When she said  
  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
Hold me, hold me like you want me  
Like you'll never let me go?  
She said, "Show me that you really love me"  
And then tell me  
'Cause I really need to know?  
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me?"
