I've been loving you too long to stop now  
  
You were tired and you want to be free  
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me  
Oh I've been loving you a little too long  
I don't want to stop now, oh  
With you my life  
Has been so wonderful  
I can't stop now  
  
You were tired and your love is growing cold  
My love is growing stronger as our affair affair grows old  
I've been loving you a little too long, long  
To stop now  
Oh, oh, oh  
I've been loving you a little bit too long  
I don't want to stop now no, no, no  
  
Don't make me stop now, no baby  
I'm down on my knees please, don't make me stop now  
I love you, I love you  
I love you with all of my heart  
And I can't stop now  
Please, please don't make me stop now
