There used to be a time when candlelight and wine  
Was all that a woman would need  
Man, you'll be a winner if you took her out to dinner  
Or a movie that she wanted to see  
  
Now the world has turned and it's time you learned  
The old ain't working no more  
The rules have changed and it's a brand new game  
Buddy, if you wanna score  
  
Get off the couch and get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots, polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know, a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well, you don't stand a chance 'less you take her out to dance  
You're living in a honky tonk world  
  
Sooner or later, all you couch potatoes  
You're gonna be the lonely ones  
If you want good lovin' then you gotta keep up  
You better know your Brook's from your Dunn's  
  
And don't even think that your Englebert Humperdinck's  
Record's gonna turn her on  
Mister, you can bet if you don't know the steps  
You're gonna get left at home  
  
Get off the couch, get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots, polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know, a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well, you don't stand a chance 'less you take her out to dance  
'Cause you're living in a honky tonk world  
  
You were cro-magnon, you'd be draggin' your women  
By a hair to your cave  
You'd be down on one knee reciting them soliloquies  
Back in Romeo's day  
  
You'd be kind of nifty if you were in the Fifties  
And you had a cool car to drive  
But now you past the Nineties so you better shake your hiney  
Or you're gonna get left behind  
  
Get off the couch and get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots, polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know, a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well, you don't stand a chance 'less you take her out to dance  
You're living in a honky tonk world  
  
You don't stand a chance 'less you take her out to dance  
'Cause we're living in a honky tonk world  
  
Get off the couch and get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots, polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know, a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well, you don't stand a chance 'less you take her out to dance  
You're living in a honky tonk world  
  
You don't stand a chance 'less you take her out to dance  
'Cause you're living in a honky tonk world
