Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad  
I was bad born, I'd be badder when I die  
I'm bad when I am sober, I'm badder when I'm high  
I'm bad when I feel good, I'm bad when I'm blue  
I'm bad to myself, so I'll be bad to you  
So I'll be bad to you  
I should've been good, look at the trouble I've had  
I would if I could but I'm just bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad  
I'm, bad and I'm alive, I'll be badder when I'm dead  
I'm bad in my body, man, I'm badder in the head  
I'm bad in the bed  
Something wrong from the start  
Guilt in my mind, evil in my heart  
Evil in my heart  
I don't need to be happy, I don't care if I'm sad  
I don't care about nothin' 'cause I'm  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad  
Don't lend me a dollar, don't lend me a dime  
Don't lend me your wife, she'll have a good time  
I'm bad in my car, I'm badder when I'm home  
I'm bad when I'm with you and I'm badder all alone  
I'm a low down worm, I'm a conquering worm  
I'm a blood-suckin' worm, I'm a slime baitin' worm  
I'll put you on the hook and I'll watch you squirm  
I could never learn any young turk's new tricks  
I could never learn not to kick against the pricks  
Things go from bad to worse, sometimes it makes me  
Glad that I was born under the curse of being  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad  
Don't lend me a dollar, don't lend me dime  
Don't lend me your wife, she'll have a good time  
Don't lend me a twenty, don't lend me a ten  
If you lend me a hundred, you'll never see me again  
What I would do? These are the very things I don't do  
And what I would not do? Those are the things that I do  
Who shall deliver from this body of death  
It's not Mohammad and it's not Seth  
I tried to be happy but it only made me sad  
I wanted to be good but I'm just  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad, bad, bad
