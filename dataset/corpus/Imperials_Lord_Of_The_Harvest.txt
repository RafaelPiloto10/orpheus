See the fields, ripe and white as snow  
Up from the seeds of faith we planted long ago  
So many the hearts in season  
With every prayer they've grown  
You have made them ready  
But we must bring them home  
  
Chorus:  
Lord of the harvest place your fire in me  
Servant you need now, servant I will be  
Give me the eyes of your spirit,  
Your heart of compassion to know  
Lord of the harvest, show me where to go  
  
Time like a free wind, so quickly slips away  
Too soon today's tomorrow, too soon yesterday  
So little time for the reaping and the laborers are few  
Lift your head to the fields of white  
The work that you must do  
  
Chorus  
  
Wherever you may lead me  
Lord of the Harvest I'll Go  
  
(Repeat)
