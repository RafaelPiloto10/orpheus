They say we're young and undecided that we should wait before we love  
But this ain't no what they dinied us when they take away our right to love  
Though we're not together darling you're still a part of me my love  
But time will give a flame that's burning for they took away our ight to love  
  
Hear this song and listen closely the words I got from him above  
I asked him this and he's told me we're entitled to the right to love  
You'll be sad if you're unblessed that young hearts feel the meaning of  
True love they offer set us fancy they're entitled to the right to love
