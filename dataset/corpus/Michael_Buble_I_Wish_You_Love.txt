I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
I wish you health  
And more than wealth  
I wish you love  
  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health  
And more than wealth  
I wish you love  
  
My breaking heart and I agree  
That you and I could never be  
So with my best  
My very best  
I set you free  
  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
And a cozy fire to keep you warm  
And most of all  
When snowflakes fall  
I wish you love
