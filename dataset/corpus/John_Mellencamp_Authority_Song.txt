They like to get you in a compromising position  
They like to get you there and smile in your face  
They think, they're so cute when they got you in that condition  
Well I think, it's a total disgrace  
  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I been doing it, since I was a young kid  
I've come out grinnin'  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
  
So I call up my preacher  
I say: "Gimme strength for Round 5"  
He said: "You don't need no strength, you need to grow up, son"  
I said: "Growing up leads to growing old and then to dying,  
And dying to me don't sound like all that much fun"  
  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I been doing it, since I was a young kid  
I've come out grinnin'  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I been doing it, since I was a young kid  
I've come out grinnin'  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
Oh no  
Oh no  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I been doing it, since I was a young kid  
I've come out grinnin'  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I fight authority, authority always wins  
I been doing it, since I was a young kid  
I've come out grinnin'  
I fight authority, authority always wins
