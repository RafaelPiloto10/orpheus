Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
I can't break free  
There's some kind of hold over me  
Like a magnet, you attract me like steel  
I'm a kamikaze pilot, it's a one-way flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
I'm a do or die fanatic, no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You don't stand a snowball's chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time before I get  
Over my head in your quicksand bed  
The more I struggle the more I'm sucked in
