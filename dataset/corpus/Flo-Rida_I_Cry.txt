(I know caught up in the middle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting
go  
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go  
  
I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one Rida  
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver  
Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa  
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors  
Norway no you didn't get my flowers  
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward  
Face just showers, the minute in a hour  
Heard about the news all day went sour  
Lil mama got me feeling like a Lemonhead  
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes  
Give em my regards or regardless i get arrested  
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless  
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace  
DUI never said i was driving reckless  
You and I or jealously was not oppressive  
Oh no i can't stop i was destined  
  
(I know caught up in the middle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting
go

(I know caught up in the middle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting
go  
(Oh no gave up on the riddle) I cry, just a little when I think of letting go  
  
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it  
And i put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix  
Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it  
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket  
Clean next get a call just a lil' visit  
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid  
Reality see when your blessed just kill critics  
Buggatti never when im rich, just god fearing  
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring  
Gotta good feeling, plus the right caring, tell his Billie Jeans  
I'm on another planet  
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries  
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit  
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish  
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish  
No cheers i know you wouldn't panic

When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling  
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now  
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling  
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now  
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling  
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now  
When i need a healing, i just look up to the ceiling  
I see the sun coming down i know its all better now
