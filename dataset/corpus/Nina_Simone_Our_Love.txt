Sol marcus, bennie benjamin  
  
Anytime things go wrong  
Baby we'll still get along  
Cos we have each other  
And our love will se us through  
  
If some tears come our way  
The sun skips a day  
We still have each other  
And our love will se us through  
  
Just as long as you and I  
Have a little tender kiss to share  
There's no doubt at all that we'll get by  
Grey skies will all turn bare  
  
So when some clouds bring the rain  
We've no cause to complain  
Cos we have each other  
And our love will se us through  
Cos we have each other  
And our love will se us through
