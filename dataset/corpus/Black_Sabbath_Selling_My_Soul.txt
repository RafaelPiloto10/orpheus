Man of madness who lives in my head  
Keeping me awake at night he sits on my bed  
He drives me crazy, he won't go away  
Playing his game every night and everyday, yeah-ah  
  
My mind feels heavy, my body feels weak  
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep  
Impending doom is what I'm about  
Think I'm going mad without a shadow of doubt  
  
I search for serenity yeah  
Is it really out there?  
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere  
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control  
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul  
Selling My Soul  
  
I search for serenity yeah  
Is it really out there?  
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere  
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control  
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul  
Selling My Soul  
  
Yeah-ah  
For Selling My Soul  
Yeah-ah  
Selling My Soul  
Yeah-ah  
For Selling My Soul
