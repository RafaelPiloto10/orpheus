I take off time to time  
With those crazy friends of mine  
Head out on steel horses  
With wheels and we ride  
  
We burn up that road to old Mexico  
Blend in with the desert  
Just we amigos  
And we roll  
  
Cowboys like us sure do have fun  
Racin' the wind, chasin' the sun  
Take the long way around back to square one  
Today we're just outlaws out on the run  
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such  
For cowboys like us  
  
We talk about livin', babies, and women  
All that we've lost and all we've been givin'  
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done  
Drink one more cold one, come mornin' get up  
And we roll  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Cowboys like us
