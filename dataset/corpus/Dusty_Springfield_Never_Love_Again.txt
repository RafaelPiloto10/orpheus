Dear Lord above  
I swear that I  
I will never love again  
Unless I'm lovin' him  
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh  
He came to me  
With a twinkle in his eye  
And I fell for him  
Yes, I fell for him  
Took me by surprise  
Unaware was I  
Well I fell for him  
Oh, I fell for him  
If I ever needed help, I need it now  
Ain't none of my so-called friends  
Got the power to make my tears go 'way  
So on my knees I pray  
That you bring his love my way  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that I'll  
Never, never love again  
Oh, no ho  
I stare down at the eyes  
And wipe the tears I cried  
When I fell for him  
Yes, I fell him  
Gettin' next to me  
Was all he wanted to see  
Well goody-good for him  
Goody-good for him  
When my heart's in trouble  
And my mind's in doubt  
You're the only one who could ever work it out  
And bring the sun back in my day  
So on my knees I pray  
That you send his love my way  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that I'll  
I will never love again  
Unless I'm loving him  
No I'll never, never, never, never  
Never, never, never gonna love again  
Oh, yes I'm never, never, never  
Never, never, never, never gonna love again  
Dear Lord above  
I swear that I'll  
Never, never, never, never, love again  
Unless I'm lovin' him  
Said I'm never, never, never, never
