Photographs of fancy tricks  
To get your kicks at sixty-six  
He thinks of all the lips that he licks  
And all the girls that he's goin' to fix  
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle  
But there's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle  
Capital punishment, she's last year's model  
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Everybody's got new orders  
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders  
Now the teacher is away  
All the kids begin to play  
Men come screaming, dressed in white coats  
Shake you very gently by the throat  
One's named Gus, one's named Alfie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else  
I don't want to go to Chelsea
