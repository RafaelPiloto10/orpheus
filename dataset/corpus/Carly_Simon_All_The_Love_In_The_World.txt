Jake  
I know your face  
So well  
Close my eyes  
And see it still  
Though time can turn  
A heart to stone  
Your face will stay  
A face I've known  
  
Jake  
Some things  
Still hurt and how  
And God  
It's hard  
To see you now  
Because you  
My life a hell  
And Jake  
I know your face  
So well  
  
And it was always  
All right there  
Why didn't you know  
It was all right there  
Why couldn't I show you  
It was always there  
  
All the love  
In the world  
All the love  
All the love  
In the world
