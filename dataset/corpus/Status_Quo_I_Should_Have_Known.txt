I found out what I wanted, I found out when I needed to  
You thought me kind-a-hearted, I heard that when I wanted you  
Being wrong isn't easy, right's another way  
Being wrong isn't easy, right's another way  
  
A-when you want me, just think like you're ready to  
Like me when I want to, why me does it have to be?  
Everyone tried to tell me, right's another way  
Everyone tried to tell me, right's another way  
  
Trust me to fall apart, trust you to know  
Just you and no-one else, just me alone  
Why did it have to be? I should have known  
Oh I should have known  
  
I can't tell, did you mean it? Did you mean what I think you did?  
I won't give less you need it, just a bit could be overhead  
I won't wait for a minute, can't hesitate  
I won't wait for a minute, can't hesitate  
  
Trust me to fall apart, trust you to know  
Just you and no-one else, just me alone  
Why did it have to be? I should have known  
Oh I should have known
