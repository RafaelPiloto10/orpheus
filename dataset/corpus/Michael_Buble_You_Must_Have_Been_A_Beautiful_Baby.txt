You must have been a beautiful baby  
You must have been a wonderful child  
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten  
I bet you drove those other childs wild.  
  
And when it came to winning blue ribbons  
I bet you taught those other kids how.  
I can see the judges' eyes when they handed you the prize  
You had the cutest bow.  
  
You must've been a beautiful baby  
'Cause baby look at you now.
