In the magic garden  
Some were singing  
Some were dancing  
While the midnight moon  
Shone brightly overhead  
  
The stars so gaily glistened  
And the sphinx in silence listened to  
The magician tell of  
Lives that he had led  
  
Let the bells of freedom ring  
Songs of love to Friday's king  
  
Let's all go to  
The magician's birthday  
It's in a forest  
But not so far away  
Much to do  
And so much to say  
While we listened to  
The orchid orchestra play  
  
Happy Birthay to you  
Happy Birthday to magician  
Happy Birthday to you  
  
Then at the dead of midnight  
As we watched the dancing firelight  
The air grew cold  
And seemed to dull the flame  
The fire died  
The music faded  
Filled with fear of death we waited  
For now we knew  
Some evil was to blame  
  
I challenge you  
I challenge you all  
For all you own  
And all you know  
And by all the powers of darkness  
I will steal what is mine  
  
Surrender now or face my spite  
I grant you it may be Friday night  
But did you know this day  
Also numbers thirteen  
  
First I'll give you fire  
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream  
Yes, now I give you nightmares  
From your horror I'll create a dream  
  
You cannot fight me  
For I have the sword of hate  
But one thing you can't see  
My answer is simply  
An impenetrable fortress  
Of love, love, love  
  
The fear went as quickly as it came  
The air was clear  
The fire burned again  
The flames leapt  
The organ played  
The swans sang  
To greet the day  
And then we knew that  
Love will find love will find love
