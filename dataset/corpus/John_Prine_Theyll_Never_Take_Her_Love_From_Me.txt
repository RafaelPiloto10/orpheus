If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares  
There is still one smiling face the Gods would see  
But she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs  
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me  
  
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave  
And watch her love turn into sympathy  
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave  
Oh they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness  
That we shared together in the use to be  
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress  
But they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
Well, I though I'd make her happy if I'd step aside  
But I knew her love would never set me free  
And even on the morning she became another's bride  
I said they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
No, they'll never, never take her love from me
