I am happy  
That I have you  
Even though you're not here now  
I know somewhere  
You are dreaming  
Though it's definitely not of me  
  
It doesn't matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But I'm praying  
That we're staying  
Together  
  
I am warmed by  
Your friendship  
Even when you're far away  
And I'm happy  
In the knowledge  
We may never see the day  
  
When I kiss you  
And you kiss me  
Don't pretend you miss me  
The worst kind  
Of diseased mind  
Is one filled with jealousy  
  
If we should meet again  
Don't try to solve the puzzle  
Just lay down next to me  
And please don't move a muscle  
  
I will thank you  
Most of all for  
The respect you have for me  
I'm embarrassed  
It overwhelms me  
Because I don't deserve any  
  
It doesn't matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But I'm praying  
That we're staying  
Together
