There's an empty place inside that is hurting me  
A place that keeps my heart out on it's own  
A disconnected function of my wretchedness  
That keeps me so hard pressed  
It's a place where words are spoken you  
Will never hear  
A broken bridge of lines that just won't come  
An empty lung that won't give the wind  
To speak at me  
How far can it be from home  
  
Why you gotta be so mean to me  
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see  
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need  
So why you gotta be so mean to me  
  
Do you think that it got up and left  
For good this time  
A crowd of faceless strangers moving on  
A feeling that you left it all behind you now  
That it doesn't hurt somehow  
To know  
  
Why you gotta be so mean to me  
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see  
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need  
So why you gotta be so mean to me  
  
So open up the book that you keep deep inside  
Let the pages yellow in the sun  
Show them that you're not afraid to let them see  
How far you can be From home  
  
Why you gotta be so mean to me  
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see  
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need  
So why you gotta be so fucking mean to me  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be so mean to me
