You led me to believe  
That what we have was made to be  
Your conclusions, they came too soon  
(Don't get me wrong coz I don't wanna blame you)  
It was just coz my heart was unprepared  
(For this drama, this hell in my head)  
Can't digest your reasons for letting go  
It's just not fair how love can turn so cold  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here I stand in front of you  
Naked as can be and my heart so true  
Look me in the eye and hold my hand  
(Tell me if you really love me)  
  
Now after all that we've been through  
The heartaches, the pain, the laughter too  
Is the love still burning?  
Is the love still burning?  
  
I can't pretend, can't escape cuz I'm not content  
I hold on to moments built on trust  
Emotions makin me weak  
To overcome you is killin me  
(All good things come to it's end)  
Leaving a broken path which destiny has changed  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
Here I stand in front of you  
Naked as can be and my heart so true  
Look me in the eye and hold my hand  
(Tell me if you really love me)  
  
[Bridge:]  
Love me (so, that you can)  
Break me (and then youll just)  
Leave me (tell me why)  
  
[Chorus:] [4x]  
Here I stand in front of you  
Naked as can be and my heart so true  
Look me in the eye and hold my hand  
(Tell me if you really love me)
