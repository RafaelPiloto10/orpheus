(Hello, I Love You - Doors)  
  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I trust you  
But you can't tell these days  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I want you  
But let's wait a few days  
  
She might look nice and sweet  
But sleeps with every guy she meets  
You might think you know some guy  
But you know guys and they always lie  
  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I trust you  
But you can't tell these days  
Hello I love you  
And liked to get laid  
You know I want you  
But I'm deathly afraid  
  
She holds my hand and sighs  
But her hand won't satisfy  
Our thoughts are wicked  
But our legs are crossed  
And I doubt I can hold out too long  
  
The doc won't know for at least a week  
I'm like a dog locked up when my mate's in heat  
And I hope she doesn't see me drool  
Cuz I hope to use my rusty tool  
  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
  
'Uh, Hullo? '  
  
'Good news Mr. Johnson, your test results are in and you're back in business.
'  
  
'Yippee! Yahoo! Yahooie! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! '  
  
I need my baby now  
Let's go  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
The lizard king is back
