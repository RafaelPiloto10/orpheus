Free me  
Free me  
Why don't you free me  
Free me from your spell  
Come on and free me  
Why don't you free me  
Come on and free me  
Free me from your spell.  
  
Why should I worry that you might not love  
you're not  
The only love that I've ever had.  
Your sweet memory will always comfort me  
So why should I be feeling sad  
As far as I can tell  
You knew so well  
I was always at the end of the line  
I've loved you as much  
As any man can  
But not enough to make you mine  
So long easy rider  
I know I'll miss you for a while  
But sooner or later  
I know that I'll forget you  
  
And I tell your baby  
  
Free me  
Come on and free me  
  
We let a good love die.  
We let it pass us by  
Through you tried to keep me hanging on  
  
But with all this doubt  
It'll never work out  
So tomorrow I'll be traveling on  
And saying so long easy rider  
I know I'll miss you for a while  
But sooner or later  
I know that I'll forget you  
  
Free me  
oh yeah  
Come on and free me  
Why don't you free me  
Free me from your spell  
Oh yeah  
Come on and free me  
Why don't you free me  
Free me from your spell  
  
Free me  
Oh bab' come on and free me  
Free me
