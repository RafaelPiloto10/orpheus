This is not a test of the Emergency Broadcast System,  
This is the Real Thing!!!  
And if you tape my voice, which you should never ever do  
You'll kiss your ass goodbye, I'm talking to you  
  
Got plans for helter-skelter  
Kids, Mom and Dad in the shelter  
Cowering with flag held high  
American will never die  
Make plans to rise once more  
And be ready for World War Four  
Who need civil defense?  
Who needs civil defense?  
  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, don't even try  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, we're all gonna die  
  
Won't matter who is first  
We'll be blown off the earth  
Don't try to survive the burst  
Rotting death is even worse  
Why try to survive that day?  
No one else will anyway  
Who needs civil defense?  
Who needs civil defense?  
  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, don't even try  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, we're all gonna die  
  
Fuck You!
