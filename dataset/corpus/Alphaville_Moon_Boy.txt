you gave me strength, you pushed the blades away from me  
oh how we dreamt to change the world  
and we would never give in, no matter what they say  
a really cool connection in a cruel world  
you led me through the nights - and through the hardest fights  
we dreamt wed be the ones - and we would never lose  
you made me speechless - and fearless - yet it made you fearless too  
oh how we dreamt to be so fearless - no matter what they do  
i dont know where you are now - we shared a dream of being together  
you led me to the light, yeah - for this i would like to thank you forever  
moonboy...  
youve been around, a distant star, youve seen them come and go  
those unknown chaps without a slightest chance  
i know, all without faith are liars even when theyre dreaming  
id even put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
our minds are filled with crazy dreams - they seem to be unreachable  
but if you give them up they stay - till someone else takes them away  
i met you in this hotel hall - oh nino, aint it hard  
not to be understood  
but all you said was: hey, i just wanna sing (like an angel)  
i dont know where you are now - we shared a dream of being together  
you led me to the light, yeah - for this i would like to thank you forever  
moonboy...  
i dont know where you are now - you come and go whenever you like..  
just believe in your powers - you might find out youre invincible...  
no matter what they say...
