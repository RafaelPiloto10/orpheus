Walk me out in the morning dew, my heart  
Walk me out in the morning dew, my heart  
You know I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my heart  
Oh, I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my heart  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry at all  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry at all  
Now there is no morning dew  
Now there is no morning dew  
What they've been saying all these years has come true  
What they've been saying all these years has come true  
Got no morning dew, oh
