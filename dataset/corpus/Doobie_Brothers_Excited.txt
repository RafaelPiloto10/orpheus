Week by week, day by day  
You got me changin' in so many ways  
Thinking of you i feel the call  
Somebody get a doctor  
I'm starting to fall  
  
I get excited don't you understand  
I get excited 'cause it's part of the plan  
  
Day by day, hour by hour  
I get a shiver from your lovin' power  
Fire in your eyes just lets me know  
Ain't no way i ever let go  
  
I get excited don't you understand  
I get excited 'cause it's part of the plan  
  
Hot love, what you bring to me  
I get excited by the novelty  
Hot love, like a fever you feed  
Black lace and promise is all that i need  
You bring it on  
  
I love it baby, i love it all  
Anytime, anytime you call  
Day or night as the world moves on  
It's time for action, the talkin' is done
