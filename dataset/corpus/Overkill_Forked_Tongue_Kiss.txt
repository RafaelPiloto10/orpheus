Long view on the eye a pocketful a pestilence  
Got a fistful of memories,a long lost innocence  
Hey baby, dead baby devil he embracin' you  
With a long forked-tongue-kiss  
Suckin' all the life from you  
  
If you need to reach me  
I'm breaking one through ten  
And if you really need me  
Can I get an amen  
  
Passion on a ??????? gotta get it while it's not  
With a self-centered psychopath givin' a forget-me-not  
Rape me, rape me everybody gets in line  
With a long forked-tongue-kiss  
Sucked away the rest of time  
  
If you need to reach me  
I'm breaking one through ten  
And if you really need me  
Can I get an amen  
  
Longview in your eye  
Seal it with a kiss, you get the  
Long forked tongue kiss  
Memory in your fist, seal it with a kiss  
You get the  
Long forked tongue kiss  
  
Lay on down in the bed you made  
It's a little too late to cry  
Or too be afraid  
  
Driven by the high heat, call it love  
Driven by the high heat  
Of the velvet glove  
  
Call it free-will,call it choice  
You know you ain't alone now  
There's a second voice  
When you're not alone  
  
Short view on the eye, a pocketful a' pestilence  
With a fistful a' memories, a long lost innocence  
Be-be-be-baby devil he embracin' you  
With a long-forked-tongue-kiss  
Suckin' all the life from you  
  
If you need to reach me  
I'm breaking one through ten  
And if you really need me  
Can I get an amen [Repeat x2]  
  
Longview in your eye  
Seal it with a kiss, you get the  
Long forked tongue kiss  
Memory in your fist, seal it with a kiss  
You get the  
Long forked tongue kiss
