Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
Took a sailor's loving  
For a nursery game.  
  
Well, the heart she gave me  
Wasn't made of stone.  
No, the heart she gave me  
Wasn't made of stone.  
It was sweet and hollow  
Like a honeycomb.  
  
Think I'll wait till sunset,  
See the ensign down.  
Think I'll wait till sunset,  
See the ensign down.  
Then I'll take the tideway  
To my burial ground.  
  
Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
When my body's landed.  
Hope she dies of shame.
