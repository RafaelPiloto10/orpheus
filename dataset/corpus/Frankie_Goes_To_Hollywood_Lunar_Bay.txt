Walk right through my soul, keep out the cold  
Make me lose control, fill me with love  
My mind is blasing and were escaping, the real world  
Swing and sway on Lunar bay  
On Lunar bay, yeah  
  
Touch my very soul, makes me lose control  
My dreams unfold, you fill me with love  
  
Feel me walking in the sun  
Hear me talking to the moon  
I won't change for anyone  
I'm just for you  
  
Touch my very soul, makes me lose control  
My dreams unfold, fill me with love  
The train of faces are going places, get on board  
Swing and sway on Lunar bay  
On Lunar bay , yeah  
  
Swing and sway, swing and sway  
  
Feel me walking in the sun  
Hear me talking to the moon  
I won't change for anyone  
I'm just for you  
When the wind rushes in  
To hemald the king  
Just stay in my heart  
Forever more  
  
Feel me walking in the sun  
I won't change for anyone  
When the wind rushes in  
To hemald the king  
Just stay in my heart  
Forever more  
  
In the sun  
I won't change for anyone  
  
In the common age of automation, where people might  
Eventually work ten or twenty hours a week, Man for  
The first time will be forced to confront himself with  
The true spiritual problems of living
