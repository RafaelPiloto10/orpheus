Know who you are...  
There's a world wants to know you  
Know where to go...  
There's a world wants to touch you  
  
Feel all you can...  
Let your heart speak and guide you  
Don't be afraid...  
Of the love deep inside you.  
  
Bring it out for everyone  
When you smile we can see the sun  
Bring it out for all to hear  
Because you have so much to give  
  
And there's so much to know  
But if you wait for your moment  
Well, it may never show.  
  
Know who you are...  
There' a new song inside you,  
Weep if you can...  
Let the tears fall behind you.  
  
Bring it out for everyone,  
When you smile we can see the sun,  
Sing it out for all to hear  
Because you have so much to say  
  
And you have so much to do  
And everyone's waiting,  
Yes, it's all up to you.  
  
Know who you are...  
There's a world deep inside ou,  
Trust if you can...  
There's a friend the to guide you.
