We've been sweethearts for so long  
But now you say we're through  
The love we shared is now a memory  
I have built a ship of dreams  
And planned them all for you  
But now I guess what is to be, will be  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I'll sail my ship alone  
With all the dreams I own  
Drifting out across the ocean blue  
Yes, I'll sail my ship alone  
Tho' all the sails you've torn  
And when it starts to sinkin'  
I'll blame you  
Now, I gave a message to the wind  
To take back home to you  
Hoping you would hear my S-O-S  
I thought that you would come back home  
My darlin', if you knew  
How much my achin' heart was in distress  
Well,  
REPEAT [CHORUS:]
