Until All Have Been Served  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Brother and sisters sharing communion  
Holding the bread of life in their hands  
In just a few hours theyd be going home  
Serving the Lord in faraway lands  
When someone said,  
Has everyone been served?  
This is what was heard  
Chorus:  
No, no, not everyone has been served  
No, no, we need to  
Take them to his word  
How can they know him  
When theyve never heard?  
No, no, not everyone has been served  
With tears in their eyes  
They prayed for the cities  
Where millions of people suffer each day  
They live and they die  
Never knowing why  
No one is there to show them the way  
And the Father says,  
Has everyone been served?  
For so long He has heard  
Chorus (repeat)  
We are the light and we know the truth  
Can we forget what were called to do?  
No, no, not until all have been served  
No, no, we need to  
Take them to his word  
In every nation let this cry be heard  
No, no, not until all have been served  
No, no, not until all have been served  
No, no, we need to  
Take them to his word  
In every nation, let this cry be heard  
No, no, not until all have been served
