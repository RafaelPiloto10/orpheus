The men that I've been seeing  
Well they got their soul up on a shelf  
You know they could never love me  
'cause they can't even love themselves  
  
But I want someone to love me  
Baby I want one to understand  
Won't put himself above me  
Who can love me like a man  
  
I never seen such losers  
Even though I tried  
Find a mind to take me home instead of  
Taking me for a ride  
  
Baby, I use someone to care  
Believe it when I tell you darlin'  
You can love me like a man  
  
Oh they want me to rock them  
Like my back ain't got no bone  
I want a man whose gonna rock me  
Like my backbone was his own  
  
Baby, I want to wait until you can  
Believe it when I tell you darlin'  
You can love me like a man  
  
Come home sad and lonely  
Feel like I want to cry  
Come over here and hold me baby  
And don't ever ask the reason why  
I said I, I want a lover  
Won't have to work to understand  
  
Don't put yourself above me baby  
Love me like a man
