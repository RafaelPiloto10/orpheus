I was just walking that day aimlessly  
You picked the perfect day to bump into me (perfect day)  
Probably should watch the stars in the sky the night before (hey)  
For some reason we still met at your store  
  
You baby  
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell  
And I have my whole life  
And I listen well  
  
Hey,  
Look I'll be the confidant  
Tell me anything,  
Please start it off with how you took your wings  
  
Oh oh, ooh,  
There's nothing else that I have seen  
There's no getting around it or in between  
You're out of this world  
  
Except you're not green  
Look  
You don't know what you mean to me (to me)  
  
All my friends meet you and say you're the one  
(you're the one, you're the one)  
And all my meaningless friendships should be done  
(I should just leave them alone)  
Baby hey hey  
  
You had a friend  
But he did you wrong  
But I'm a God-sent sign that reads please move on (with me)  
  
You taught me to use my heart and to forget my eyes  
(use my heart, forget my eyes)  
And that's the way to his kingdom of eternal life (oh hey hey hey)  
Since you're an angel baby, you're job's never done  
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 911  
  
That's why,  
There's nothing else that I have seen  
There's no getting around it or in between (you oh)  
You're out of this world  
  
Except you're not green  
Look  
You don't know what you mean to me (to me)  
  
There's nothing else that I have seen  
There's no getting around it or in between  
You're out of this world  
  
Except you're not green  
Look  
You don't know what you mean to me (to me)  
  
There's nothing else in this world, like you  
That's why it's so complicated, what are you afraid of?  
  
Oh oh..  
I've been asking everybody what they think  
Yeah yeah  
I don't know why because they don't know you  
  
Oh oh  
I've been asking other guys what would they say  
Hey yeah  
I don't know why cause they don't do what I do  
  
Oh no  
Girl, say an ultimatum for  
Yeah yeah  
But you'd probably just take that and run  
  
Oh no  
Now I gotta decide if I'm gonna help raise you right  
Yeah yeah  
So now the ultimatum's on me, that's no fun  
  
I was just walking that day aimlessly (da, da, da, dum)  
(da, da, da, dum, oh oh oh)
