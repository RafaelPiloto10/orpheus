You were never no good (x4)  
  
Oh no...  
You say that love is wrong  
?cause I know that love is strong  
When you get it from some they say  
That love is just thrown away  
Did they ever love you my way  
  
You were never no good (x4)  
  
Oh no...  
Someone is gonna pay  
For taking my heart away  
If it?s love that you want to show  
How am I supposed to know  
In my way  
  
You were never no good (x20)  
  
Did you say that love is wrong  
You showed you were weak from the strong  
You keep leaving me to feel  
That wicked emotion you steal  
You don?t understand
