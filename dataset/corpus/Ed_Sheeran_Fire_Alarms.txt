The rain won't stop falling,  
It's harder than before  
This car keeps on stalling,  
Pedal to the floor  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know is if you want me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We were young and we were foolish  
Schoolbooks in our arms  
Dodging homework, dodging classes  
To set off fire alarms  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call
