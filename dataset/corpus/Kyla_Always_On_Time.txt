When I am lost you were there  
You pulled me through,  
And bring me to the right track  
When I'm afraid, you let me feel your love is near  
You gently comfort me,  
You never let me drown in my world of fear  
You're always here, your love is so securing  
You always bring my heart to sing,  
When I'm so low  
You have been so uplifting  
You're always there whenever I need you in time  
You're never late, you're timing always perfect  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Ooh oh oh my love ooh oh oh mylove  
I can count on you,  
Through all the tides you're by my side  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good love, sweet joy in my heart you bring  
I really just can't get enough  
Of all these lovely things  
You never failed me, assured,  
You're always on time  
You've been my hope, my strength  
My shield in times of need,  
If I might fall you're there to catch me  
You're there for me, i don't worry  
You're always on time  
  
When I am lost you were there  
You pulled me through,  
And bring me to the right track  
When I'm afraid, you let me feel your love is near  
You gently comfort me,  
You never let me drown in my world of fear  
You're always here, your love is so securing  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Ooh oh oh my love ooh oh oh mylove  
I can count on you,  
Through all the tides you're by my side  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good love, sweet joy in my heart you bring  
I really just can't get enough  
Of all these lovely things  
You never failed me, assured,  
You're always on time  
You've been my hope, my strength  
My shield in times of need,  
If I might fall you're there to catch me  
You're there for me, i don't worry  
You're always on time  
  
[Bridge:]  
So if the times they just a little hard for me  
And all the people they just  
Seem to give up on me  
But you won't let me fall  
You won't give up on me  
You're always on time, its you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Good love, sweet joy in my heart you bring  
I really just can't get enough  
Of all these lovely things  
You never failed me, assured,  
You're always on time  
You've been my hope, my strength  
My shield in times of need,  
If I might fall you're there to catch me  
You're there for me, i don't worry  
You're always on time  
  
[Break]  
  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I say baby,  
You've made me stronger than I used before so  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Come on, I reach out for you,  
Each day I love you more  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I say baby I need you,  
Just can't go on without your love  
Everything's gonna be alright  
No need to worry, you're always on time
