There ain't no arms that could ever hold you  
Not like mine,  
Ooh baby no.  
There ain't no lips that could ever please you Big Daddy,  
Not like mine  
Oooh Oh no.  
  
You won't find a better lover  
In all a million years,  
They will come  
They will go but you won't find any  
  
Not like mine [Repeat x 6]  
  
There'll be no thrills that could ever chill you,  
Not like mine  
Ooh baby no.  
A there'll be no words that will ever charm you  
Not like mine  
Unh unh oh no.  
  
You won't find the things that I'll do for you  
In any, any, anyone else.  
They will try they will lose  
'Cause they can't fit your groove.  
  
Not like mine [Repeat x 6]  
  
Hunh, hunh, hunh, a yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Shout) Oh I'm the woman that you need!  
Oh Yeah, ooh you will not find another, not like this simple lover.  
Ooh yeah  
Ooh you know that I'm a sweet thing and you know that's the real thing.  
And you know that's good for you  
Oh, don't be deceived, you know I'm what you need,  
Whoa, oh,  
Lemme hear ya say,  
  
Not like mine [Repeat x 6]
