Let it bleed, until you run dry  
Let it bleed, tomorrow's never gonna come  
  
'Cause the black rain is fallin' tonight  
I can't find my way home  
'Cause the black rain is fallin' tonight  
I can't find my way home  
  
I can't take all of the bad days  
When it rains, it's better not to go outside  
  
'Cause the black rain is fallin' tonight  
I can't find my way home  
'Cause the black rain is fallin' tonight  
I can't find my way home  
  
Going all the way down, oh yeah  
Going all the way down, it's coming down  
  
Let it bleed, until you run dry  
Let it bleed, tomorrow's never gonna come  
  
'Cause the black rain is fallin' tonight  
I can't find my way home  
'Cause the black rain is fallin' tonight  
I can't find my way home  
  
It's coming down, oh, it's coming down, yeah
