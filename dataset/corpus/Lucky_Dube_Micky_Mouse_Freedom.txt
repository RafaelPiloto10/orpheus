Put his coat on his shoulders and slowly he walked away  
Behind him he could hear  
Those innocent voices  
Crying out so bitterly saying  
We did not start the war But we fighting now  
We did not start the fire  
But we burning now

They never knew it was a  
Chorus:  
Mickey Mouse freedom independence  
Me come ina you country  
That is said to be free (x2)  
Me sight corruption.  
Me sight starvation  
Walking like a millionaire 'cause you think you country is free  
One thing you don't know is that your country is being remote controlled  
Chorus:  
Mickey Mouse freedom independence (till fade)
