Morning, this morning the curtains are shut  
I'd ring you in the morning but the phone's been cut  
Can you hear me, I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
The radio reporter said the line's all dead  
He told me that I oughta write a letter instead  
Can you hear me, I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
Yes I'd wish they'd fix the wires cause my baby won't know  
That I'm leaving in the morning and I'm ready to go  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me at all  
Gotta get the operator, make a telephone call  
And if I write a letter it won't get there on time  
I'll only reach you baby on the telephone line  
Can you hear me, I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
My car's all ready and my bags are all packed  
I'm late already and I won't be back  
Can you hear me, I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
chorus 3x  
Can you hear me at all?
