I come down from the misty mountain  
I got lost on the human highway  
Take my head refreshing fountain  
Take my eyes from what they've seen.  
Take my head and change my mind  
How could people get so unkind.  
  
I come down from the crooked mansion  
I went lookin' for the D.J.'s daughter  
Since that day I heard it mentioned  
That my name is on the line.  
Now, my name is on the line  
How could people get so unkind.  
  
Now, my name is on the line  
How could people get so unkind.  
  
I come down from the misty mountain  
I got lost on the human highway  
Take my head refreshing fountain  
Take my eyes from what they've seen.  
Take my head and change my mind  
How could people get so unkind.
