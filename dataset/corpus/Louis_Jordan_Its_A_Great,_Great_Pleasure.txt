It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill  
  
Did you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones?  
Do you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones?  
Do you get a funny feelin' running up and down your bones?  
That's rheumatism  
  
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill  
When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill  
  
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand?  
Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand?  
Find you ain't got a nickel and your woman's got another man  
Bad deal
