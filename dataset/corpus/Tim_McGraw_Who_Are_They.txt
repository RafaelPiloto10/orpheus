They say not to have too much fun  
They say not to get too much sun  
Democrat or Republican  
Guess I'm screwed I'm neither one  
  
Don't say hell say what the heck  
Do what politically correct  
Don't pray in school but have safe sex  
Isn't that what they expect  
  
[Chorus]  
Who are they, yeah you know what they say  
Who are they, someone I gotta pay  
Who are they, they're probably livin' in L.A.  
And I don't care anyway, who are they  
  
They probably own the Village Voice  
The Nashville Scene, the People's Choice  
To me it's just a bunch of noise  
Decided on by funny boys  
  
They say who does and don't belong  
They say our hair's too short or long  
They say who's right and who's wrong  
As if we'll all just come along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I wonder if they've got a life  
A broken car and two ex-wives  
Do they drink beer on Friday night  
I wonder if they like to fight  
  
And I wonder if they've got a soul  
Or if they like their rock-n-roll  
Where do they live, I gotta know  
So I can tell 'em where to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I don't care anyway  
They're probably livin' out in L.A.  
Who are they  
Aw, you know what they say  
  
Who are they, who are they, who are they  
Who are they
