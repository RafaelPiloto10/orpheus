I can barely remember my past  
Everything seems to disappear so fast  
But I recall being jealous and alone  
Gazing at the dreams going by  
  
I started my life when you knocked on the door  
Found something inside I didn't dare to ignore  
Now I do believe in flowers on the moon  
I'll swim beside the golden tide  
  
You crashed by the gate  
Captured my fate  
Salvation  
My eyes couldn't see  
I hardly breathed  
I was diving so deep  
Salvation  
  
I'm down in the study holding on to my luck  
Will you still love me when I call you up?  
I gave you my body, the power over me  
Come on, bring out the best in me  
  
You crashed by the gate  
Captured my fate  
Salvation  
My eyes couldn't see  
I hardly breathed  
My heart was asleep  
Salvation  
Some will get broken  
Others will get lucky like me meeting you  
Don't pass me by  
  
You crashed by the gate  
Captured my fate  
Salvation  
My eyes couldn't see  
I hardly breathed  
I was down on my knees  
Salvation  
Some will get broken  
Others will get lucky like me meeting you  
Don't pass me by  
Don't pass me by  
  
I found salvation, oh yea  
You bring me salvation  
I found salvation
