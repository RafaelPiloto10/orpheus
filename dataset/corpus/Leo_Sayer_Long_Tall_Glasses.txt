I was travellin' down the road  
Feelin' hungry and cold  
I saw a sign down the road sayin'  
Food and drinks for everyone  
So naturally I thought  
I would take me a look inside  
I saw so much food  
There was water coming from my eyes  
  
Yeah there was ham and there was turkey  
There was caviar  
And long tall glasses  
With wine up to why'are  
And somebody grabbed me  
Threw me out on my chair  
Said before you can eat  
You gotta dance like Fred Astaire  
  
You know I can't dance you know I can't dance  
You know I can't dance you know I can't dance  
I can't dance  
  
I am a man of the road  
A hobo by name  
I don't seek entertainment  
Just poultry and game  
But if it's all the same to you  
Then yes I will try my hand  
If you were hungry as me  
Then I'm sure you will understand  
  
Now wait a minute  
  
Of course I can dance  
Of course I can dance  
I'm sure I can dance  
I'm sure I can dance  
I can dance  
I really hit the floor  
Ah it feels good  
Look at me dancing  
  
I did a two-step quick-step and a bossa nova  
A little Victor Sylvester and a Rudy Valentino  
You should have seen me moving  
Right across the floor  
Hand me down my tuxedo  
Next week I'm coming back for more  
  
I can dance  
Oh yes I can dance  
Look at me dance on the floor moving  
I feel good  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance  
I can dance
