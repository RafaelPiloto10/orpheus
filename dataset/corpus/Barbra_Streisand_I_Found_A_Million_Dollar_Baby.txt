Fanny  
It was a lucky april shower  
It was a most convenient dorm  
I found a million dollar baby in a five and ten cent store  
The rain continued for an hour  
I hang around for three our four  
Around a million dollar baby in a five an ten cent store  
She was selling china  
And when she made those eyes  
I kept buying china until the crop got wise  
Incidentally  
If you should run into a shower  
Just step inside my cottage door  
And meet the million dollar baby from the five and ten cent store
