I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe  
  
Where have you been?  
'Cause I never see you out  
Are you hiding from me, yeah?  
Somewhere in the crowd  
  
Where have you been?  
All my life, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life?  
Where have you been, all my life?  
Where have you been, all my life?  
Where have you been, all my life?  
  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night long  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe  
  
Where have you been?  
'Cause I never see you out  
Are you hiding from me, yeah?  
Somewhere in the crowd  
  
Where have you been?  
All my life, all my life  
Where have you been, all my life?  
Where have you been, all my life?  
Where have you been, all my life?  
Where have you been, all my life?  
  
Where have you been, all my life?  
  
You can have me all you want  
Any way, any day  
To show me where you are tonight  
  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for someone  
Someone who can please me  
Love me all night  
I've been everywhere, man  
Looking for you babe  
Looking for you babe  
Searching for you babe
