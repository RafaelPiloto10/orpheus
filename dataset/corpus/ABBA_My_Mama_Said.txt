Tried to sneak out without saying  
With my loudest record playing  
Ooh, my mama said, "Look at this, you haven't done your bed"  
My mama said, "That's a thing that you should do instead"  
  
Then I did what she had told me  
Dying for my friend to hold me  
Ooh, my mama said, "Try and get one thing into your head"  
My mama said, "Pa and me, we give you room and bed"  
How I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
In the morning she said "Listen"  
Ooh, I felt like in a prison  
Yeah, my mama said, "I know you've been out again with Fred"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
I said I can live without it  
How I wish you wouldn't doubt it  
Ooh, my mama said, "If you want to hurt me go ahead"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "I suppose you'd rather see me dead"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life [Repeat: x4]
