It don't look good,  
It don't look great  
You know what's going down you really gonna hate  
This is the moment, you know the score  
This is what your enemies have waited for  
You're going down  
And everybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Take a look, there ain't no doubt about it  
You're in real bad shape  
Everything that you don't need  
Is waiting at your garden gate  
So take a smile, take a woe  
You got the rest of your life to wonder why and how  
Save that for later, you're far too busy now  
Because  
You're going down  
And everybody knows  
That's the way it goes
