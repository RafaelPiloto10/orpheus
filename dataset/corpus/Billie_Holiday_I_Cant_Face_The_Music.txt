Breeze, stop moanin' those weird melodies  
My man has left me  
And I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
Rain, your rhythm on my window pane  
Drives me insane because  
I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
My heart is so broken  
I've spoken to the Lord for sympathy  
And if He don't help me, so help me  
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me  
  
I'm gonna end this misery  
My man has left me  
And I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
My heart is so broken  
I've spoken to the Lord for sympathy  
And if He don't help me, so help me  
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me  
  
I'm gonna end this misery  
My man has left me  
And I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
I can't face the music
