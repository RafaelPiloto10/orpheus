Everyone says sooner or later you'll reach the end of the line  
When things get rough some think it's easy to jump the ship . . .  
You decide  
I say--don't throw it away  
There's about a million reasons why  
Though you've heard them all before  
And you're getting very tired  
Lay your head on my lap and I'll sing you this lullaby  
CHORUS  
Don't you know  
That everyone around you  
Has felt the pain you feel today  
You're out of control yeah--and you want someone to tell you  
When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream  
You're out of control . . .  
There's a cloud-rollin' overhead and it seems to rain on no one else  
There's a black sun--casting a black shadow,  
And I know you feel so all alone  
You're out of control--and you want the world to love you  
Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know  
That you live and breathe and suffer  
And your back is in the corner and you've got nowhere to go  
Nothin' for nothin'--everything's right at your fingertips--for a price  
Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise  
I say--don't throw it away, you've got too many things to say  
If you throw your life, if you throw away your life . . .  
THe world will never be the same  
CHORUS  
You're out of control--and you move without direction  
And people look right through your soul  
You're out of control--and you want someone to tell you  
When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream  
And I wish that I could tell you, it'll only be a dream
