Welcome to my city  
The girls are so damn pretty  
Such a pity, they don't come for free  
  
Just call me pimp daddy  
I'll roll ya one big fatty  
I think you're gonna like a hangin' with me  
  
[Chorus]  
Welcome to my city of sin  
I believe you're gonna fit right in  
Yes this is my city of sin  
You're first lesson is about to begin  
Now you're living in the city of sin  
You don't mind if I call you friend  
Once you enter you can never get out of here  
Welcome to Hollyweird  
  
I'm the king of the streets  
I own the cops, the junkies and freaks  
It's a human wasteland I call home  
  
Grow your hair to your shoes  
Trust me boy you just can't lose  
Soon this be the only life you've ever known  
  
[Chorus]
