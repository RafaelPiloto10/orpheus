I don't care much for smokin' weed  
You know I'm a man of a different breed  
I don't thrive on drinking alcohol  
'Sides I'm feelin' much too tall  
  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
And I don't mean I'm gettin' stoned  
  
I was just a buckin' bronco bomb  
I loved me a billion black and blue eyed blondes  
I never thought I could change  
Yep sure is pretty strange  
  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
Gettin' high  
On something I've never known  
I've got a babe of my own  
  
Gettin' high  
I've got a babe of my own  
I've got a girl of my own
