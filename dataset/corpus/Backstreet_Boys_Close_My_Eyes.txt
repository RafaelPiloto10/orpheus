My feet on the ground but I can't run  
Drowning the noise inside my head  
Who is this man that I've become  
It's killing me to see myself  
How do you learn how to forgive  
When deep down inside you can't forget  
With all that I regret  
And I pray for the first time in a long time  
The lies fade away  
  
Finally I'm waking up  
I feel like I can let you go  
Say everything I wanted to say  
I'm ok with being alone  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
  
I'm alive  
I never was sure but now I am  
This was the choice I had to make  
Maybe I'll never understand  
Sometimes you've got to make mistakes  
  
Finally I'm waking up  
I feel like I can let you go  
Say everything I wanted to say  
I'm ok with being alone  
Finally I face it off  
I feel like I can let it show  
I know I can walk away  
I'm ok with being alone  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
  
How do you know where to go when you go away  
  
When I close my eyes  
  
How do you know When it's over  
  
I see for the first time in a long time  
Believe me when I say  
  
Finally I'm waking up  
I feel like I can let you go  
Say everything I wanted to say  
I'm ok with being alone  
Finally I face it off  
I feel like I can let it show  
I know I can walk away  
I'm ok with being alone  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
  
I'm alive
