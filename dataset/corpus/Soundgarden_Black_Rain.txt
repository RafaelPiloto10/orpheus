If I could hug my love, could I try  
For your wings to cover me and let them fold  
Half alive, I heard the most brilliant lie  
Sleepless eyes, close the light  
And rest your mind while you burn  
  
Can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes  
By cutting out your tongue you save face  
Feeding on the blood lets running from a big day  
  
Cry on black rain, cry on black rain  
Cry on black rain  
  
If I could hug my love could I try  
For your wings to cover me unless I fall  
Sleepless eyes, close the light  
And rest your mind while you burn  
  
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes  
By cutting out your tongue you save face  
Feeding on the blood lets running from a black day  
  
Cry on black rain, cry on black rain  
Cry on black rain  
Black rain, cry on  
Black rain, cry on  
Cry on  
  
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes  
By cutting out your tongue you save face  
Feeding on the blood that's running from a black day
