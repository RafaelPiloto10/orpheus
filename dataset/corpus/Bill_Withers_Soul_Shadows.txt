San Francisco morning coming clear and cold  
Don't know if I'm waking or I'm dreaming  
Riding with Fats Waller on the Super Chief  
He said, musics real, the rest is seeming  
  
Oh, deep pain  
Feeling that won't go away  
There's the sound of his soul in the air  
I can hear it up there  
And I know he left those soul shadows  
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind  
  
Soul shadows on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
Soul shadows on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
  
Standing by the window as a fog rolls in  
I swear I can hear a far-off music  
Jelly Roll is playing down in Storyville  
And Satchmo is wailing in Chicago  
You ought to heard 'em play  
Feelings that won't go away  
Left the sound of their souls in the air  
I hear out there and I know  
  
They left them soul shadows all on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
They left them soul shadows all on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
They left soul shadows on my mind  
They left them shadows on my mind  
They left them soul shadows on my mind
