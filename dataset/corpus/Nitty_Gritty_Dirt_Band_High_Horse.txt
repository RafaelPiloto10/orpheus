Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
And get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Moonlit shadow, she starts a trippin' firelight  
Jumpin' the trees lyin' across the right of way  
Silvery mornin' it glistens down the valley  
But she don't stop 'til we ride the night away  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Blonde braids tangle at the misty break of mornin'  
Catchin' light through a dusty window pane  
Lost in lust, in denial of the warnin'  
She digs her heels in this stallion's flank again  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You paid the price, you get to play  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You're gonna ride to the break of day  
  
To the break of day  
To the break of day  
To the break of day  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You paid the price, you get to play  
Get up on your high horse, woman  
You're gonna ride to the break of day
