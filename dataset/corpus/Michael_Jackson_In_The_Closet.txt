She's just a lover, who makes me high  
Is it worth the giving, is it worth the try  
You cannot cleave it, or put it in the furnace  
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it  
  
She wants to give it  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Dare me  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)  
She wants to give it  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Yea  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)  
  
One thing in life you must understand  
The truth of lust woman to man  
So open the door, and you will see  
There are no secrets  
Make your move, set me free  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
I swear there's something about you baby  
  
Just promise me, whatever we say  
Whatever we do to each other  
For now we take a vow to just  
Keep it in the closet  
  
If you can get it, it's worth a try  
I really want it, I can't deny  
It's just desire, I really love it  
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it  
She wants to give it  
  
She wants to give it  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Dare me  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)  
She wants to give it  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Yea  
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)  
  
Just open the door, and you will see  
This passion burns inside of me  
Don't say to me, you'll never tell  
Touch me there, make the move  
Cast the spell  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
I swear there's something about you baby  
  
Just promise me, whatever we say  
Or do to each other  
For now we'll make a vow to just  
Keep it in the closet  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
That makes me want to give it to you  
  
Because there's something about you baby  
  
Just promise me, whatever we say  
Or do to each other  
For now we'll make a vow to just  
Keep it in the closet  
  
She wants to give it,  
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it  
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it  
She wants to give it,  
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it  
She wants to give it,  
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
