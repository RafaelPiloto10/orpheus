I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven, yeah  
  
High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man  
And the love train rides from coast to coast  
D.J.'s the man we love the most  
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean  
And smash any hope of democracy?  
As the headline says you're free to choose  
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes  
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues

Johnny Panic And The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I get excited by the news of today  
What seems unstable may be able to stay  
Johnny Panic  
Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I dream of heaven, yeah  
  
I spy tears in their eyes  
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention  
Food goes to waste!  
So nice to eat, so nice to taste  
Politician Grannie with your high ideals  
Have you no idea how the Majority feels ?  
So without love and a promise land  
We're fools to the rules of a government plan  
Kick out the style! Bring back the jam!  
Bring back the jam!  
  
My flame is heart, My baby do as she please  
What good is living, when you live in disease  
Johnny Panic  
Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I dream of heaven, it's a heavenly place  
Why fall in love? when you can fall from grace  
With Johnny Panic  
Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven, yeah
