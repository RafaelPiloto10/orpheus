When they all come crashing down- midflight  
You know you're not the only one  
When they're so alone they find a back door out of life  
You know you're not the only one  
  
We're all grieving  
Lost and bleeding  
  
All our lives  
We've been waiting  
For someone to call our leader  
All your lies  
I'm not believing  
Heaven shine a light down on me  
  
So afraid to open your eyes- hypnotized  
You know you're not the only one  
Never understood this life  
And you're right I don't deserve but you know I'm not the only one  
  
We're all grieving  
Lost and bleeding  
  
All our lives  
We've been waiting  
For someone to call our leader  
All your lies  
I'm not believing  
Heaven shine a light down on me  
  
Don't look down  
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you  
Don't look down, you'll fall down,  
You'll become their sacrifice  
Right or wrong  
Can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you  
If I can't feel, I'm not mine,  
I'm not real  
  
All our lives  
We've been waiting  
For someone to call our leader  
All your lies  
I'm not believing  
Heaven shine a light down on me
