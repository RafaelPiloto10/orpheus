[Chorus: ]  
The chances you gave me  
A definite maybe  
But luck she's a lady, stayed  
She played for me  
  
There's gold in the mountain  
Good fortune for countin'  
Three coins in the fountain  
And my luck won't change  
  
Take dust from the coalmine  
Make dust from the goldmine  
King Midas you're sidelined  
And my luck won't change no my luck remains  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
No point in shouting,  
Whoever there was doubting,  
I'm at the top of the mountain  
And my luck won't change  
  
The stock market read it  
The rumors they spread it  
And I meant it when I said it  
That my luck won't change  
No, my luck remains  
  
That old lover lost me  
She spent and she cost me  
My new love has taught me  
That my luck won't change  
(my luck won't change, my luck remains)  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
The offer she made me  
Was more than just maybe  
But luck who's a lady stayed  
She played for me  
  
[Repeat: 1st verse]  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
My temperature's rising  
No point in disguising  
The phoenix is arising  
And my luck won't change, no it just remains
