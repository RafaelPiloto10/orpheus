In a forest known as heartbreak  
In a clearing in the wood  
'Cross a pathway called confusion  
Toward the garden of delight  
  
You'll reach the river of desire  
And meekly try and cross it  
While the valley of love  
Keeps avoiding you  
Because it's only an illusion  
Only an illusion  
  
Upon the hill of high ideals  
You begin to wonder if it's real  
You are reaching sleep's oasis  
You begin to wonder how you feel  
  
But it happens so quickly  
It doesn't fit into your scenes  
Tossin' and turnin'  
The star of so many scenes  
It's only an illusion  
It's only an illusion
