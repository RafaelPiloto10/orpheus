He made the news today for the first time on page three.  
Left the local supermarket job in sale and figures.  
Makes a treat each week, tomorrow sits at home.  
He'd be such a lovely boy if he'd only leave the girls alone.  
You could see it in his face  
Each time he ran away.  
  
It was a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
Bathroom porcelain and handles made of brass.  
Took the proper grooming and full year language class.  
They're sure he's the guy to snatch them from this scene  
and take them to some place they're sure their mother's never been.  
You could see it in his face  
As the colour drained away.  
  
It was a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
Cold evenings create a living room dance.  
Spend late nights revolving around one lost chance.  
Oh yeah.  
  
They're gonna jump the train it's the last one today.  
Join us in the back row of the ones that got away.  
Join a big parade, it works for you and me.  
And you'll add a thrill because you'll hear it on TV.  
Throw it up against the wall  
Just to see how far it falls.  
'cause it's a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.
