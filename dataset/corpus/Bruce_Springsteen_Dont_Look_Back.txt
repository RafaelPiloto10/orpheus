Cold rain running down the front of my shirt  
I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt  
Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street  
She's straddling the shifter in my front seat  
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak  
The deck's stacked  
So put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back  
  
We're making night tracks through the blazing rain  
Blowin' pistons, workin' the fast lane  
Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash  
Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash  
There's nothing to lose  
It's a bad break but baby we're backed  
Tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back  
We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain  
We made it through the heart of a hurricane  
We tore it apart and put it together again  
  
Well angel, won't you believe in love for me  
C'mon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street  
We'll move with the city in the dark  
You got to walk, it talk, it in your heart  
There's nothin' to lose it's a heartache  
The deck's stacked  
So put your foot to the floor, darling  
Tonight we'll blow off the doors, baby  
We're gonna even the score  
And honey we won't look back
