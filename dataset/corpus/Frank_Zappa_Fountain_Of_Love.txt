It was September, the leaves were gold  
That's when our hearts knew that story untold  
We were young lovers, strolling near  
The fountain of love, founttain of love  
Do you remember, I held you so near  
Our love's glowing ember so precious and dear  
We were young lovers, strolling near  
The fountain of love, the fountain of love  
Fountain of love, fountain of love  
We made a wish and threw in a coin  
And since that day our hearts have been joined  
So all you young lovers, wherever you are  
The fountain of love is not very far  
We'll go on dreaming of that golden day  
And remember the fountain is not far away  
We were young lovers strolling near  
The fountain of love, fountain of love  
Fountain of love, fountain of love  
(spoken)  
We made a wish and threw in a coin  
And since that day, our hearts have been joined  
So all you young lovers wherever you are  
The fountain of love is not very far  
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo  
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo  
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo  
Fountain of love, oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
