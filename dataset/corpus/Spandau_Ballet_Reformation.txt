Bleak and tired western skies  
Silence crashing with quiet lies  
Shattered glass reflects elation  
Reformation, reformation  
I saw you running through my dreams  
Question held me to the scene  
Your face was wet with perspiration  
Reformation, reformation  
there's something wrong, there's something wrong  
Man is something that must be overcome  
Quick, snap, break, crack, complication  
Reformation, reformation  
I saw you running through my dreams  
A sun burst through a cloudy scene  
Shattered glass reflects elation  
Reformation, reformation  
Bleak and tired western skies  
Silence crashing with quiet lies  
Shattered glass reflects elation  
Reformation, reformation
