Hey, got my hands in my back pocket  
I'm a jumpin'  
Unscrewing the light from the socket  
And I'd rather stand than sit  
Puttin' all the people in the dark  
Tellin' everyone good night bye bye  
I put the sound  
  
Carryin' the truth in my back pocket  
My hands are holdin' me down  
I've been waiting for people to ask me  
What have you found  
  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I was dead before a gypsy  
She held my head and  
Fought with my boots till my eyes turned red  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
Oh I'd rather stand than sit  
I've been down to the gutter  
Hopin' I've lived on honey and butter  
But with me a life's a game  
I call insane  
I'm not the one to blame  
I'm called insane  
  
I was hung when I was young  
I was named insane  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I broke all the laws before my age  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
Yeah I'd rather stand than sit  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I turn around to see the clown  
But with me a life's a game  
I call insane  
I'm not the one to blame  
I'm called insane  
  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I'd rather stand than sit  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I'd rather stand than sit  
I put the sound
