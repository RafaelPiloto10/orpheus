I've known you for so long  
You are a friend of mine  
But is this all we'd ever be?  
I've loved you ever since  
You are a friend of mine  
But babe, is this all we ever could be?  
  
You tell me things I've never known  
I've shown you love you've never shown  
But then again, when you cry  
I'm always at your side  
You tell me 'bout the love you've had  
I listen very eagerly  
But deep inside you'll never see  
This feeling of emptiness  
It makes me feel sad  
But then again I'm glad  
  
I've known you all my life  
You are a friend of mine  
I know this is how it's gonna be  
I've loved you then and I love you still  
You're a friend of mine  
Now, I know friends are all we ever could be  
  
You tell me things I've never known  
I've shown you love you've never shown  
But then again, when you cry  
I'm always at your side  
You tell me 'bout the love you've had  
And I listen very eagerly  
But deep inside you'll never see  
This feeling of emptiness  
It makes me feel sad  
  
But then again  
Then again  
Then again I'm glad
