Seasons may change, we stay the same.  
We always stay the same.  
We always stay the same.  
  
Winter brings snow, when no, no flowers grow.  
They wait for the Spring.  
Yes, they wait 'til the Spring.  
  
In the Spring, young men grow.  
'Til they're old enough to know,  
Better.  
Better.  
  
Leaves have turned green, now Spring has been  
And gone  
Summer's here.  
  
The Autumn trees swing to and fro.  
Their leaves turn brown,  
Now young men know  
Better.  
Better.  
  
["Just let me listen to that."]  
Ev'ryone one feels good  
And I knew they would.  
It's been quite a good year.  
It's been quite a good year.  
It's been quite a good year.
