I can still remember yesterday  
We were so in love in a special way  
And knowing that you loved me  
Made me feel oh so right  
  
But now I feel lost, don't know what to do  
Each and every day I think of you  
Holdin' back the tears,  
I'm trying with all my might  
  
Because you've gone and left me standing  
All alone  
And I know I've got to face tomorrow  
On my own  
  
Before I let you go  
I want to say I love you  
I hope that you're list'nin'  
'Coz it's true, baby  
  
You'll be forever in my heart  
And I know that no one else will do  
So before I let you go  
I want to say it...I love you  
  
I wish that It could be just like before  
I know I coul've given you so much more  
Even though you know  
I'd given you all my love  
  
I miss your smile, I miss your kiss  
Each and every day I reminisce  
'Coz baby it's you  
That i'm always dreaming of...  
  
Because you've gone and left me standing  
All alone  
And I know I've got to face tomorrow  
On my own  
  
Before I let you go  
I want to say I love you  
I hope that you're list'nin'  
'Cause it's true, baby  
  
You'll be forever in my heart  
And I know that no one else will do  
So before I let you go  
I want to say it...I love you  
  
Letting love go  
Is never easy  
But I love you so  
That's why I set you free  
  
I know someday  
Somehow, I'll find a way  
To leave it all behind me  
'Guess it wasn't meant to be  
  
But baby...  
  
Before I let you go  
I want to say I love you  
I hope that you're list'nin'  
'Cause it's true, baby  
  
You'll be forever in my heart  
And I know that no one else will do  
So before I let you go  
I want to say it...I love you
