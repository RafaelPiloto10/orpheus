I try and feel the sunshine  
You bring the rain  
You try and hold me down  
With your complaints  
You cry and moan and complain  
You whine an tear  
Up to my neck in sorrow  
The touch you bring  
You just don't step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own head...that's what I say  
You know...I've been the beggar...  
I've played the thief  
I was the dog...they all tried to beat  
  
But it's been  
Fourteen years of silence  
It's been  
Fourteen years of pain  
It's been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And I'll never have again  
  
Your stupid girlfriends tell you  
That I'm to blame  
Well - they're all used-up has-beens  
Out of the game  
This time I'll have the last word  
You hear what I say  
I tried to see it your way  
It won't work today  
You don't just step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own head...that's what I say  
You know...I've been the dealer...hangin' on your street  
I was the dog...they all tried to beat  
  
But it's been  
Fourteen years of silence  
It's been  
Fourteen years of pain  
It's been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And I'll never have again  
  
Bullshit and contemplation  
Gossip's their trade  
If they knew half the real truth  
What would they say  
Well I'm past the point of concern  
It's time to play  
These last four years of madness  
Sure put me straight  
You don't get back fourteen years  
In just one day  
So hard to keep my own head  
Just go away  
You know...just like a hooker she said  
Nothin's for free  
Oh I tried to see it your way  
I tried to see it your way
