It's late at night, I'm all alone  
I call you up, hear your voice on the phone  
Say that you're mine, tell me it's true  
Say that my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know  
  
Here I am, part of the crowd  
Need you so bad, I'm dreamin' out loud  
Say that you're mine, tell me it's true  
Say that my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know  
  
It's late at night, and I'm all alone  
So I call you up, to hear your voice on the phone  
Sayin' your mine, sayin' it's true  
Please say my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know
