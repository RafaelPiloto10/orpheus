Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Look at my heart floating away)  
  
He's the kind of guy that would say  
'Hey baby let's get away let's go some place, huh''  
Well I don't care  
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything  
And trust your heart, share all of your love, till death do you part  
  
I want to be what he wants when he wants it, and whenever he needs it  
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved  
I'll be there to feed it  
I'm givin' him a little bit for each day  
He turns me right on when I hear him say  
  
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far  
(Baby can we')  
Well I don't care  
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far  
(Baby can we')  
Well I don't care  
  
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it  
And whenever he needs it  
When it comes to bein' feelin' loved starved I'll be there to feed it  
Lovin him a little bit more each day  
It turns me right on when I hear him say  
  
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far)  
(Baby can we') Well, I don't care  
(Hey baby let's get away, let's go somewhere far)  
(Baby can we') Well, I don't care  
  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you) ho  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)  
(Look at my heart, floating away)  
  
(Day dreaming) day dreaming of you  
(Day dreaming)  
Thinking of you  
  
Day, dreaming  
Day, dreaming
