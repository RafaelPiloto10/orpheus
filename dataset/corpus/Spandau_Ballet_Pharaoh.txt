Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  
Please don't let my memory fail me now  
'Cause I've waited all this time and I can't run another mile  
(Another mile)  
Oh, please don't let the world know now  
Please don't let the world know now  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping
