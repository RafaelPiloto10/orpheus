(J. Bundrick)  
  
Mary, grab the baby, the river's rising  
Muddy water taking back the land  
The old-frame house, she can't take-a one more beating  
Ain't no use to stay and make a stand  
  
  
Well the morning light shows water in the valley  
Daddy's grave just went below the line  
Things to say, you just can't take em with ya  
This flood will swallow all you've left behind  
  
  
Won't be back to start all over  
Cause what I felt before is gone  
  
  
Mary, take the child, the river's rising  
Muddy water taking back my home  
The road is gone, there's just one way to leave here  
Turn my back on what I've left below  
Shifting land, broken farms around me  
Muddy water's changing all I know  
  
  
It's hard to say just what I'm losing  
Ain't never felt so all alone  
  
  
Mary, take the child, the river's rising  
Muddy water taking back my home  
  
  
Won't be back to start all over  
Cause what I felt before is gone  
  
  
Mary, take the child, the river's rising  
Muddy water's changing all I know  
Muddy water's changing all I know  
Lord, this muddy water is taking back my home
