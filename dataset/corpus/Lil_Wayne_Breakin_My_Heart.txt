(feat. Little Brother)  
  
Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow
groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me
and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for
you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done
gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.  
  
[Bridge:]  
She loves me, she loves me not.  
  
[Verse 1: Little Brother]  
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.  
You wanted the role, smash the audition.  
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.  
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.  
And some say it's the life I was given.  
I say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.  
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.  
On a new broad, you still one to one.  
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.  
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.  
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.  
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.  
The last thought I get is Koobie run.  
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.  
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Brother]  
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.  
Every morning, and every evening.  
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.  
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.  
In the nfl which mean Not For Long.  
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.  
Word get back to wifey, she like "Stop the song,"  
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.  
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.  
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.  
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.  
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.  
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids.  
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.  
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.  
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life.  
And he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record.  
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.  
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]  
I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.  
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.  
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.  
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo.  
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.  
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.  
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta.  
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.  
And I know cheaters never get crowned.  
So I play "fair" like roller coasters and clowns.  
You gotta hold ya soldier down.  
Even when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.  
And you don't want to leave me, believe me.  
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv.  
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought.  
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Wayne First, Lil Brother Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart
