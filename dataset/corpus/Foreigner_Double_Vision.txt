Feeling down n' dirty, feeling kinda mean  
I've been from one to another extreme  
This time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait  
I want to stick around till I can't see straight  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me  
My double vision gets the best of me  
  
Never do more than I really need  
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit  
I live all of my years in a single minute  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me  
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah  
  
Ooh, double vision, I need my double vision  
It takes me out of my head, takin' me out of my head  
I get my double vision, oh, seeing double double  
Oh, I have double vision, yeah, I'm getting double vision
