I've got a wife and four grown children  
I can't afford their education  
I've been a prison guard for fourteen years  
That ain't exactly a vacation  
Since he's been here he's followed ev'ry rule and I  
Told you my position  
The law says he's got the right to go to school  
We abide by the court's decision  
  
I got a Winchester two forty three  
I like that gun for deer  
  
Upstate November and the air is free  
Feels like hunting seasons here  
He's the one to keep your eye on  
He's a sneak yeah but he's quiet  
He's a trouble maker if I ever seen one  
Next thing ya know it's Attica  
And we got a prison riot  
  
There ain't no way that punk gets his degree  
And hides behind the constitution  
No way in hell that smart assed spic goes free  
Not while I'm in this institution
