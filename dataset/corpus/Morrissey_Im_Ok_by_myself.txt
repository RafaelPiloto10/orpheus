Could this be an arm around my waist?  
Well, surely the hand contains a knife  
It's been so all of my life  
Why change now? - "It hasn't!"  
Now this might surprise you, but  
I find I'm OK by myself  
And I don't need you  
Or your morality to save me  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
Then came an arm around my shoulder  
Well surely the hand holds a revolver  
It's been so all of my life  
Why change now? - "It hasn't!"  
Now this might disturb you, but  
I find I'm o.k. by myself  
And I don't need you  
Or your benevolence to make sense  
No, no, no!  
  
After all these years  
I find I'm OK by myself  
And I don't need you  
Or your homespun philosophy  
No, no, no, no  
  
This might make you throw up in your bed  
I'm o.k. by myself!  
And I don't need you  
And I never have, I never have  
No, no, no, no!
