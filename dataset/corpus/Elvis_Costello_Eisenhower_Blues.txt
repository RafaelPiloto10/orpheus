Hey everybody I'm a talking to you  
I ain't telling you jealous  
It's just the natural truth  
Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
My money's gone, the fun is gone  
The way things look I can't be here long  
Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
Taking all my money to pay the tax  
I'm telling you people the natural facts  
I'm telling you people, in my belief  
I am headed straight on relief  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
I ain't got a dime, ain't got a cent  
Ain't got no money to pay my rent  
She wants some clothes, she wants some shoes  
I'm telling you people I don't know what to do  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Talking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
Taking all my money to pay the tax  
I'm telling you people the natural facts  
I'm telling you people, in my belief  
I am headed straight on relief  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Talking about me and you and what the hell are we gonna do?
