I know a man who's got a lot to lose  
A pretty nice fella, kinda confused  
Got muscles in his head that've never been used  
He thinks he owns half of this town  
He goes out drinkin' gets a big red nose  
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose  
Then he takes her out to dinner Buys her new clothes  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day, the next you're down  
It's a half-an-inch of water and you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
I was sittin' in the bathtub just countin' my toes  
When the radiator broke, water all froze  
I was stuck in the ice without my clothes  
Naked as the eyes of a clown  
I was cryin' ice cubes, hopin' I'd croak  
When the sun came through the window, the ice all broke  
I stood up and laughed, I thought it was a joke  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day, the next you're down  
It's a half-an-inch of water and you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day, the next you're down  
It's a half-an-inch of water and you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round
