Stuart Elliot vocal  
  
Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
"You've only one shot, get it right", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run
