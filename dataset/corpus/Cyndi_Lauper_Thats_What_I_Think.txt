Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming  
Sometimes I think  
I don't know what I'll do  
But I forget the world  
And everything around me  
That's what I think  
When I think about you  
  
The streets are filled  
With too many babies  
Black air in a sky of blue  
People pass by  
No life in their eyes  
The concrete jungle's  
Really going crazy  
  
Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming...  
  
The rent is due  
And the pockets are empty  
People ask machines  
For the truth  
No crystal ball  
Can help see it all  
But where we gonna find  
The dreams to feed the babies  
  
Baby life goes on  
That's what people say  
But I'm nowhere  
If you go away  
I'd just be looking  
For a brighter day  
  
Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming...  
What can I do  
Forget about the world  
And everything around me  
That's what I think  
When I think about you
