A thousand times  
And a thousand days  
The wild bird singing  
Of true love ways  
  
Cryin' out  
From the heart of desire  
Circling over  
Night full of fire  
  
Awake in the kisses  
Oh, awake in the grave  
We've been together  
Far beyond the death  
Stay by my side in darkness, night and day  
  
Stay with me, remain, remain, remain  
Mashalla!  
Mashalla!  
  
Ancient eye  
I leave you behind  
You're not of my body  
You're not of my mind  
  
River, river no one shall remain  
Again and again I call your endless name  
Say to me darkness, night and day  
  
Say to me, remain, remain, remain  
Mashalla!  
Mashalla!  
  
Mashalla!
