You know  
That I love you  
In every way  
You bring  
So many magical wonders  
To my day  
  
How could I ever leave  
One reason why  
Cause darlin' without you  
I cannot breathe  
You're the best thing  
In all my life  
The only one  
Who helps me through  
So much pain and strife  
  
Baby you know...  
Chorus:  
You'll always be in my heart  
We'll never have reaons  
To ever part  
When I look into yor eyes  
All I see is you and I  
Together, forever in your heart  
  
Darlin' yes  
I love you more than words can say  
  
You'll always be mine  
No matter where you are  
You're always at the front  
Of my mind  
Only for eternity  
You've touched my heart  
With undying hope  
With your love  
My problems can cope  
No one will ever take your place  
When I close my eyes  
I see me  
Kissing your sweet face  
  
You're much more beautiful  
Than Heaven's glowing embrace  
Chorus  
  
You'll alwyas be  
Forever with me  
Baby, just wait and see  
You're my dream come true  
And all I can say  
Is that I love you  
  
All I can say  
Is I love you  
Every night and day  
My dreams come true  
Only when I'm with you  
Holding you near  
  
I'll always be  
With you, you'll see  
Forever, Forever in your heart  
Only always  
Forever in your heart
