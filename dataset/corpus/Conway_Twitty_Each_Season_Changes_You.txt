Like the weather your heart changes with each season  
Springtime, summer, fall and winter too  
Though I know I'll never understand the reason  
I still wonder why each season changes you.  
  
It was springtime when I found you like a flower  
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun  
In the fall I could see our love was changing  
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done.  
  
Like the weather your heart changes with each season  
Springtime, summer, fall and winter too  
Though I know I'll never understand the reason  
I still wonder why each season changes you...
