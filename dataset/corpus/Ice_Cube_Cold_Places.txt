[Chorus]  
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis  
And it seem like the world is full of cold places  
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause  
you can do it and the man will get you through it  
I believe that, homey I believe that  
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back  
  
[Ice Cube]  
They say "Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it  
How you get through it and them other niggas blew it"  
I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it  
Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it  
So self-educate, nigga don't hate  
Cause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight  
Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube  
Fuck with them dudes them niggas is new school  
The game don't change just the players  
The rhymes don't change just the fuckin' rhyme-sayers  
They make it up as they go along  
But I'm goin' on 25 years strong  
The shit I say might get you through the day  
Or change your whole life, in a major way  
The shit they say, might catch you a case  
The shit I say, feel like your birthday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this  
Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss  
She said "Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall  
All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers"  
It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket  
If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it  
Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat  
Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets  
They keep callin' me  
They keep callin', all the lil' homies keep fallin'  
In them same traps niggas can't figure out  
In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out  
Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled  
Get you in the system, get you in the soil  
And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal  
Saw you UVN, nigga digital  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know, it's fucked up how they do us  
Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis  
Take that money that was allocated to us  
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us  
Watchin' Katrina, is worser than Ike and Tina  
See New Orleans get bitch-slapped by FEMA  
Louisiana got racist-ass politics  
Free the Jena Six (Nigga free the Jena six!)  
Your honor, Osama, Obama  
Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin' with my comments  
They want us to quit, forget  
And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics  
A lunatic is in the White House  
Make me wanna go do a lick right now  
But they'll make a nigga bow down  
in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe that, homey I believe that  
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back
