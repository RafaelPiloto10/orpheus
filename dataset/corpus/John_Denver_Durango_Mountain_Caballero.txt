You know I love the trail I'm on  
And the friends who ride with me  
The country that we're passing through  
Is a paradise to see  
A haven for my spirit  
The homeland of my dreams  
My heart flies through the wilderness  
And on an eagle's wings  
And oh I love the waterfall  
And the way the river sings  
From snowcapped peaks both proud and tall  
Through forests deep and green  
The highway of the mountains  
The lifeblood of the land  
I can hear my mother speak to me  
And hold my father's hand  
  
Durango mountain caballero  
Take me for a ride  
On the backbone of this mighty land  
The continental divide  
To the place where earth and heaven meet  
The mountains and the sky  
In the heart of Colorado  
Rocky mountain high  
And oh I love the campfire  
And the circle that I'm in  
The stories and the laughter  
They should never ever end  
Forever in my memory  
Forever in my song  
On a San Juan mountain trail ride  
I'll carry you along  
  
Words and music by John Denver
