Love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it  
Don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too?  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past  
Now I've just made it  
I found you at last  
So come on  
Now let's try it  
I love you  
Can't deny it  
'Cause it's true  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me  
If we can't make it  
But just wait and see  
  
So come on now lets try it  
I love you, can't deny it  
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
So love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it, don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
