Where can I find the words to describe  
The way that I feel with you by my side?  
Everyone can see that you are good for me  
I always dreamed some day I'd find you  
Now I can put my arms around you  
And everyone agrees that you are good for me  
Yes, I think I do deserve you  
Yes, I think I really earned you  
And now it seems every cliche is true  
I can be good for you too  
I'll tell you a story of love lost and found  
There's no-one else for me now you are around  
And everyone can see that you are good for me  
Cut me adrift in the bluest of skies  
I'm so close to heaven, it was such a surprise  
Now everyone agrees that you are good for me  
Yes, I think I do deserve you  
Yes, I think I really earned you  
And now it seems every cliche is true  
I can be good for you too
