When troubles come my way,  
I look to you and everything is okay.  
When help seems to disappear,  
I look to you and everything so clear.  
  
When hard nights turn into hard days,  
How I long to see your face.  
When blue skies turn to grey.  
I look to you and then I know it's gonna be a...  
It's gonna be a lovely day.  
  
When I wake up in the morning lord,  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes.  
There's something without warning lord.  
Bears heavy on my mind.  
  
Ooh... then I look to you.  
And the world's alright with me.  
Alright, just one look to you,  
And I know it's gonna be...  
I think it's gonna be a lovely day...  
  
[Chorus: x10]  
A lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me,  
Seems impossible to face.  
And when someone else instead of me,  
Always seems to know the way,  
You know that's when I look to you.  
  
Then I look to you.  
And the world's alright with me.  
Alright, just one look to you.  
And I know it's gonna be...  
I think it's gonna be a lovely.  
  
[Chorus: x10]  
  
When I wake up in the morning Lord  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes.  
There's something without warning Lord.  
You that it bears heavy on my mind.  
When the day that lies ahead of me,  
Seems impossible to face,  
And when someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
[Chorus: x10]
