Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks,  
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks,  
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do.  
Can't believe that she needs my love so bad.  
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad.  
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see.  
  
'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown  
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down  
Just taking my love, and slip away  
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you
