Phineas:  
Come let's tip-toe into the dark.  
One good scare ought to do it!  
You'll find our bite much worse then our bark!  
One good scare ought to do you some good!  
If you should find the daily grind a tad bit taxing on my mind to help unwind
it so inclined,  
I have a small suggestion!  
That if you dare into my lair you should prepare for quite A scare!  
But will you share in this nightmare, will be my only question.  
If your hair lies lifeless and limp, one good scare ought do you are.  
Come with me now don't be A wimp!  
One little scare ought to do you some good.  
That is quite right  
I would delight it taking flight into the night and finally give you such a
fright you know I surely would!  
But, if I seem a bit extreme at my attempts to make you scream.  
Remember that this spooky scheme will cure your hiccups for good!
