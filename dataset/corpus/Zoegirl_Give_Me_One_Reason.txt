Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
I've tried so hard to change your mind  
I always thought that you'd understand the reasons why  
Why I don't want to do the things that I used to do  
Now that my heart and my soul belong to God and God alone  
Still every night's a fight to make it through  
I can't deny I'm still in love with you  
But how can you expect me to  
Walk with Him and give myself to you  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
Boy, I still long for your embrace  
But what I've found in God, oh, it could never ever be replaced  
Still I pray for the chance  
As you slip through my hands you'll come around  
But your heart's so far away from the words I'm trying to say  
Wish I could hold you both and still be true  
There's only one thing left for me to do  
Baby, I love you  
But I can't stay with you unless you love Him too  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
I've found the path that I've gotta take  
No turning back, back to the old ways  
Got a chance to take  
Sacrifice to make  
Whatever it takes I won't turn away  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go
