Well  
Dionne  
You should have held my hand  
You should have let me be your man  
Dionne  
You should have closed your eyes  
You should have held on with both hands to your prize  
Dionne  
You should have let me down easy  
If you had no plans to please me  
Dionne  
  
Dionne  
I could have been the one  
I could have shown you the shelter reserved under the sun  
Dionne, Dionne  
I could have whispered you're name  
I could have whispered you're name if only for fun  
Dionne  
You should have let me down easy  
If you had no plans to please me  
Dionne, Dionne  
Dionne  
  
Dionne  
  
Dionne, Dionne  
We could have shared a martini  
We could have danced to Mancini, till dawn  
Dionne  
I should have broke down and kissed you  
I should have I just miss you  
Dionne
