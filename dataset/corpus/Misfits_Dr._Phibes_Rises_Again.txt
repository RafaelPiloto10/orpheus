Years ago they took from me  
The only thing I ever loved  
For I've returned, hear me say  
There's nowhere to run  
  
Vengeance is mine, snap of your spine  
Tracking, the wolf's at your throat  
  
Succulently, the beast so silent feeding  
Into Hell you go speeding  
Your life's at stake  
The abominable Dr. Phibes rises again  
By the moon crypt doors open  
Every last bone was broken  
Murder without a clue  
For Dr. Phibes rises again  
  
Oh, my wife again you'll live  
The gift of life be mine to give  
First there's things that I must do  
Make them pay for killing you  
  
My patients, my prey, all flesh torn away  
Nurse scalpel please, skinned to the bone  
Killed on the phone, what a shame, no one home  
  
Succulently, the beast so silent feeding  
Into Hell you go speeding  
Your life's he takes  
The abominable Dr. Phibes rises again  
By the moon crypt doors open  
Killed before one word's spoken  
Murder without a clue  
For Dr. Phibes rises again  
  
Ancient Egyptian river  
Once upon life will give her  
And there we'll ride, oh  
Anton Phibes, oh rises again, rises again  
  
Down, down the river of life  
No more pain, no more strife  
And we can be together again, yeah  
  
Oh, to be, oh forever to be  
Oh, oh, it is my dream  
It is our destiny, oh oh oh  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
The beast so savage feeding  
From his brow sweat is beading  
Make no mistake  
For Dr. Phibes rises again  
All of the lives I've taken  
For you my heart was breakin'  
No one survives when  
Dr. Phibes rises again  
As we sit on the river  
Breath of life make me shiver  
Open your eyes my dear  
Rise from the grave  
Now that my task's completed  
For I have death defeated  
Gone without a trace  
Anton Phibes, oh rises again, rises again  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Rises again  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
