The mind is grey like the city, packing in and overgrown  
Love is deep, dig it out  
Standing in a hole alone  
Working for something that one can never hold  
A place in the clouds  
Good place to hide oh my oh...  
So I'm flying (away, away)  
Driving (away, away)  
Finding hope in ways I missed before  
I missed before  
The tv, she talks to me  
Breaking news and building walls  
Selling me what I don't need  
I never knew soap made you taller  
So I'm riding (away, away)  
Hiding (away, away)  
So much talk it makes no sense at all  
My senses have gone... awol, awol, awol, awol, awol...  
So I'm hiding (away, away)  
Driving (away, away)  
Passing new friends I won't know at all  
Won't know at all  
It doesn't hurt when I bleed  
But my memories, they eat me  
I've seen it all before...  
Bring it on, cause I'm no victim  
Dying (away, away)  
Dying (away, away)  
Dying  
Dying...
