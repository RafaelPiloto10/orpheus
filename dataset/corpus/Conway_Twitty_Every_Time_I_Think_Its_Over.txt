When we run into problems  
It's always hard for me to compromise  
I get to thinkin' 'bout my freedom  
And all the ways that I could start another life  
And I wonder if our forever could be coming to an end  
So, everytime I think it's over, I think it over again.  
  
Too many hearts get broken  
I know that happens all the time  
But, when you split love down the middle  
Tell me, where do you draw the line  
Anyway you look at it, does anybody win  
So, everytime I think it's over, I think it over again.  
  
I've finally come to realize  
That ups and downs are all a part of love  
And, there's just no better feelin'  
When the angers dies, and we start making up  
And, from that new beginning we come back to being friends  
And, everytime I think it's over, I think it over again.  
  
Too many hearts get broken  
I know that happens all the time  
But, when you split love down the middle  
Tell me, where do you draw the line  
Anyway you look at it, does anybody win  
So, everytime I think it's over, I think it over again.  
  
And everytime I think it's over, I think it over again...
