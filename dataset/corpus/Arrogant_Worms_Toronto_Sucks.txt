I hate the skydome and the cn Tower too  
I hate Nathan Phillips Square and the Ontario Zoo  
The rents too high, the airs unclean  
The beaches are dirty and the people are mean  
And the women are big and the men are dumb  
And the children are loopy 'cause they live in a slum  
The water is polluted and the mayor's a dork  
They dress real bad and they think they're New York  
In Toronto, Ontario  
  
"You know, actually I think I hate all of Ontario"  
  
I hate Thunder Bay and Ottawa  
Kitchener, Windsor, and Oshawa  
London sucks and the Great Lakes suck  
And Sarnia sucks and Turkey Point Sucks  
  
I took a trip to ontario to visit Brian Mulrooney  
He beat me up and he stole my pants and he put me in a tree  
I went to see the Maple Leafs and got hit in the head with a puck  
  
"I don't even know how they did it, I was playing the orgon at the time!"  
  
Ontariio Sucks  
  
"actually, now tha I really think about it, I think I pretty much hate every
gosh darn province and territory in our country!Except Alberta, yeah I love
Alberta, lots of cows, trees, rocks, dirt"  
  
I hate Newfoundland 'cause they talk so weird  
And Prince Edward Island is too small  
Nova Scotia's dumb 'cause it's the name of a bank  
New Brunswick doesn't have a good mall  
Quebec is revolting and it makes me mad  
Ontario sucks, Ontario sucks,  
  
"Manitoba's population density is 1.9 people per square kilometer. NOw isn't
that stupid!?"  
  
Saskatchewan is boring and the people are old  
And as for the territories, they're too cold!  
  
And the only really good thing about the province of British Columbia is that
it's right next to us! "  
  
'cause Alberta doesn't suck  
But Calgary does
