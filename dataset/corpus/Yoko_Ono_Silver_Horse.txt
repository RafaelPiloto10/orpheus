When I come in my dream to a house I've never seen before,  
I have a tendency to look for the exit door.  
Cause I never know it may be that house again,  
I never know, I never know.  
  
When I come in my mind to a stream that's running gently,  
I have a tendency to run like a frightened deer.  
Cause I never know it may take me to that ocean again,  
I never know, I never know.  
  
I usually stay away from being carried away,  
But one day I saw a silver horse.  
I though he might take me to that somewhere high,  
I thought he might take me to that deep blue sky.  
  
I came to realize that the horse had no wings.  
"No wings, well, it wasn't so bad, you know."  
  
I learnt to travel the world around  
And run on the ground in the morning.  
And that's the story of a wandering soul,  
A story of a dreamer.
