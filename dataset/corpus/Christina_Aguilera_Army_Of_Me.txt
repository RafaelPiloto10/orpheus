I've been standing where you left me  
Praying that you'd come and get me  
But now I've found my second wind  
Now I found my second skin  
Well I know what you were thinking  
You thought you'd watch me fade away  
When you broke me into pieces  
But I gave each piece a name  
  
One of me is wiser  
One of me is stronger, one of me is a fighter  
And there's a thousand faces of me  
And we're gonna rise up  
And we're gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Well you're gonna face an army, army of me  
  
Welcome to my revolution  
All your walls are breaking down  
It's time you had a taste of losing  
Time the table's turned around  
I see a glimpse of recognition  
But it's too late ugh it's too late  
And what you though was your best decision  
Just became your worst mistake  
  
One of me is wiser  
One of me is stronger  
One of me is a fighter  
And there's a thousand faces of me  
And were gonna rise up  
And were gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Well you're gonna face an army, army of me  
  
So how does it feel  
To know that I beat ya  
That I can defeat ya  
Oh how does it feel  
'Cause it sure feels sweeter  
It should be sweeter to me  
Now that I'm wiser  
Now that I'm stronger  
Now that I'm a fighter  
There's a thousand faces of me  
And I'm gonna rise up  
I'm gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
There's a thousand faces of me  
And I'm gonna rise up  
Yeah I'm gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
You're gonna face an army  
Army of me
