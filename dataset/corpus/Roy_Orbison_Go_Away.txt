I really wouldn't mind it might be fun.  
At any other time with any other one.  
But lovers can't be friends.  
And there's only one way it can end.  
I would lose you,I would lose you.  
  
There are not many girls I can talk with.  
There are not many girls I can walk with.  
And I don't have many friends if any,  
So stay my friend and go away my friend.  
  
I'm really wanting you to go away.  
Everything you do, the things you say.  
Confuse me now and then,  
And I think I love you, my friend.  
Go away,go away.  
  
You're the only girl I have fun with.  
You're the only girl I can run with.  
You know friendship ends where love begins.  
So stay my friend and go away my friend.  
  
You know friendship ends where love begins,  
So stay my friend and go,go away.  
Go away,go away.go away....
