How soon tears begin to tumble  
From her laughing eyes  
She's been talking to somebody  
Who told her lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
Who told her lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
  
How can I begin to reach her  
Let her know the truth  
What that someone has been saying  
Is only lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
It's only lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
  
How could she think that I  
Would take advantage of a girl like her  
How could she think that I  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
  
Like a flower she is fading  
Soon she'll wilt and die  
If she doesn't get the sunlight  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
  
How could she think that I  
Would take advantage of a girl like her  
How could she think that I  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
  
Like a flower she is fading  
Soon she'll wilt and die  
If she doesn't get the sunlight  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more
