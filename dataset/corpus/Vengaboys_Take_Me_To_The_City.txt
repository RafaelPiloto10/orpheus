Don't wanna give myself to you,  
But your body's on my mind  
Just wanna dance because of  
YouYou are moving me so right  
Wake me up! Wake me up!  
Make me crazy! Have fun tonight!  
First I didn't care for you  
Could pretend it to be shy  
Then I saw the naked truth  
Your body next to mine  
Make me hot! Make me hot!  
Take me to heaven!  
Wanna feel your super body!!  
Wanna feel your super body!!  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up! Take me to the city!  
Wake me up! I make myself so pretty!  
Wake me up! To you I wanna give it!  
WoooOOOoooOOO  
I love you and you love me  
You make me happy 1, 2, 3  
For me a reason not to cry  
You lift me up and let me fly  
Wake me up! Wake me up!  
You make me crazy! Have fun tonight!  
First I didn't see it through  
When I saw that you were right  
You made me scream that I love you  
So I keep your love tonight  
Make me hot! Make me hot!  
Take me to heaven!  
Wanna feel your super body!  
Wanna feel your super body!  
[Chorus 2x]  
You gave me all the love I ever wanted  
So there is no reason for another man  
Wake me up! Wake me up!  
So I can see (WoooOOOoooOOO)  
Why I want to feel your body! (WoooOOOoooOOO)  
Oh I want to feel your body!  
Wake me up!  
Wake me up!  
[Chorus 3x]  
WoooOOOoooOOO!!!
