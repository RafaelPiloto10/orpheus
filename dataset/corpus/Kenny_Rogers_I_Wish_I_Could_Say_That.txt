Hello, it was good to get your call  
You haven't changed at all  
You're the same as far as I can tell  
No way, I see something in your face  
Someone's filled the empty space in your life  
Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing well.  
  
I wish I could say that but I'd be lying  
I'm still not over the fact  
That you stopped trying  
It was easy for you to just let go  
Of all we had  
I wish I could say that.  
  
What' Do you mean there's no one new  
It's my memory haunting you  
Now you want the things we had back then  
Inside there's a part of you  
That's still loving me and always will  
'til the end  
And you'd like to see us try again.  
  
I wish I could say that ...
