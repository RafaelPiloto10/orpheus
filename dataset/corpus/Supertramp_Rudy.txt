Rudy's on a train to nowhere, halfway down the line  
He don't want to get there, but he needs time  
He ain't sophisticated, nor well-educated  
After all the hours he wasted, still he needs time.  
He needs time - he needs time for livin',  
He needs time - for someone just to see him.  
He ain't haid no lovin'  
For no reason or rhyme  
And the whole world's above him.  
Well it's not as though he's fat-  
No there's more to this than that-  
See he tries to play it cool-  
Wouldn't be nobody fool.  
  
Rudy thought that all good things comes to those that wait  
But recently he could see that it may come too late.  
  
All through your life, all through the years  
Nobody loved, nobody cared.  
So dim the light, dark are your fears  
Try as I might, I can't hold back the tears  
How can you live without love, it's not fair?  
Someone said give but I just didn't dare.  
What good advice are you waiting to hear?  
Hearing's alright for them that's all there  
You'd better gain control now  
You'd better show 'em all now  
You'd better make or break now  
You'd better give and take now  
You'll have to push and shove now  
You'll have to find some love now  
You'd better gain control now.  
Now he's just come out the movie.  
Numb of all the pain,  
Sad but in a while he'll soon be  
Back on his train
