I used to love the tenderloin  
Until I made some tender coin  
And then I met some ladies from Marin  
We took the highway to the one,  
Up the coast to catch some sun  
That left me with these blisters on my skin  
Don't know what I was on,  
But I think it grows in Oregon,  
So I kept on goin' going on right through  
I drove into Seattle rain  
Fell in love then missed the train  
That could have took me right back home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been high, I've been low,  
I've been yes, and I've been oh, hell no!  
I've been rock 'n roll and disco,  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh)  
  
Every day so caffeinated  
I wish they were golden gated  
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away  
So wrap me up return to sender  
Let's forget this five day bender  
Take me to my city by the bay!  
  
I never knew all that I had,  
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad  
At least they have a hella fine merlot  
If I could wish upon a star  
I would hitch a cable car  
To the place that I can always call my own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been up, I've been down,  
I've been so damn lost since you're not around,  
I been reggae and calypso  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
To tell you the truth  
I miss everything, everything  
It's a wild, wild beautiful world  
But there's a wide eyed girl back there  
And she means everything, everything,  
  
I've been stop, I've been go  
I've been yes and I've been oh, hell no!  
I've been rock and roll and disco,  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
I've been up, I've been down,  
I've been so damn lost  
Since you're not around,  
I've been reggae and calypso,  
Won't you save me San Francisco?  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
(Save me San Francisco)  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
Won't you save me San Francisco  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
(Save me San Francisco)  
  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, oh  
Won't you save me San Francisco
