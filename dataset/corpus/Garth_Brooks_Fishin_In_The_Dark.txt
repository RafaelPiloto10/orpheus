Lazy yellow moon coming up tonight  
Shining through the trees  
Crickets are singing and lightning bugs  
Are floating on the breeze, baby, get ready  
  
'Cross the field where the creek turns back  
By the old stump road  
I'm gonna take you to a special place  
That nobody knows, baby, get ready  
  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
Spend the whole night through  
Feels so good to be with you  
  
Spring is almost over and the summer's coming  
The days are getting long  
I've waited all winter for the time to be right  
Just to take you along, baby, get ready  
  
And it don't matter if we sit forever  
And the fish don't bite  
We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves  
From the heat of the night, baby, get ready  
  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
Spend the whole night through  
Feels so good to be with  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
You and me going fishin' in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
  
Down by the river in the full moonlight  
We'll be falling in love in the middle of the night  
Just moving slow  
You and me going fishin' in the dark
