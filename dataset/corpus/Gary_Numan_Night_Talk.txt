Boys watch from windows tonight  
I'm not surpriesed to see you waiting here  
You keep them in business just supplying you  
Get in the car I've something to say  
  
Stay in bed why waste my time  
Open your eyes but only if you can  
Office in a sidestreet is no place for you  
Night talk and romance like beat the clock.  
  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But it's so easy to do  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk.  
  
Take things slow you can crack  
Like your face I don't understand  
How you smile and pretend it's fun  
Do you laugh when the rats come round to play?  
  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But it's so easy to do  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk.
