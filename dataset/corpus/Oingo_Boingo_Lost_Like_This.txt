I'm standing all alone out in the pouring rain  
And though it really isn't like me to complain  
I think I'm getting used to it  
I feel happy, and I also feel bad  
I've never been here, but somehow I think I have  
But I'm getting used to it  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Don't know how I got here and I don't know why I stay  
The poets all around are laughing in their graves  
Must be something that I said  
This place is not like anything I've seen before  
The spirits move around, the houses have no doors  
But I'm getting used to it  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Isn't this a fine hello  
I wish I hadn't seen you go  
It's always been a bitter pill  
The broken mirror's broken still  
The letters never made the post  
A thousand more I never wrote  
And here on dark, unfriendly streets  
I find the comfort that I seek  
And I'm happy, and I've been happy  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
I've never been lost like this  
I've never been lost like this  
But I wouldn't be, ha  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah wo wo yeah yeah yeah yeah
