I've thought I'd take a trip to Denver and spend a little time  
I thought maybe out in Denver I might get you off my mind  
No want no want go with me, just want to be alone  
I might find someone in Denver that can help me carry on  
Gone to Denver, gone to Denver, gone to mend a broken heart  
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin' I'd better be gone, gone to Denver  
Well, I've known a quiet wild, now I've been losing you  
And I'd rather might stay here and find out who I lost into  
Maybe I won't even miss you like I always thought I would  
I've heard Denver's quite a city and it changed my do me good  
Gone to Denver, gone to Denver, gone to mend a broken heart  
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin' I'd better be gone, gone to Denver  
Gone to Denver
