I watch the snowflake fall  
Against my window pane  
And wonder if you  
Are watchin' snowflakes too  
I take a walk downtown  
To where you used to meet me  
There's joy everywhere  
But all that waiting there is  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me  
No one seems to care  
They just went away and left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas Eve  
  
I hear the Christmas bells  
(Bum Bum Bum)  
The happy people singing  
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears  
I sadly close my eyes  
And say a little bear(?)  
You'll be waiting there for me  
I look but all I see is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the season of love  
(This is the season of love)  
But I'm as sad as I can be  
(sad as can be)  
Why did you have to leave me  
(Why did you leave me)  
(Why did you leave me)  
  
[Chorus]
