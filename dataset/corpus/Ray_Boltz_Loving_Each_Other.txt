Loving Each Other  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
But that doesn't mean  
That I can't love you  
You've found a place here in my heart  
So take my hand and we can start...  
CHORUS:  
Loving each other, loving the Lord  
Serving together in one accord  
There's no young or old here  
There's no rich or poor  
Loving each other, loving the Lord  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
He gave His life for me and for you  
We all have a place here in His heart  
So give me your hand and we will start...  
CHORUS  
The colors of the sunset  
Of eyes and of skin  
They were all created to glorify Him  
CHORUS  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
That doesn't mean I can't love you
