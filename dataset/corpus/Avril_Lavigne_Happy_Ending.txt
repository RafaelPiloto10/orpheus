Lets talk this over  
It's not like we're dead  
Was it something I did  
Was it somethinq you said  
Don't leave me hanging  
In a city so dead  
Held up so high on such a breakable thread  
  
You were all the things I thought I knew  
And I thought we could be  
You were everything, everything that I wanted  
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it.  
All of the memories so close to me just fade away  
All this time you were pretending  
So much for my happy ending.  
  
You've got your dumb friends  
I know what they say  
They tell you I'm difficult  
But so are they  
But they don't know me  
Do they even know you  
All the things you hide from me  
All the shit that you do.  
  
You were all the things I thought I knew  
And I thought we could be.  
You were everything, everything that I wanted  
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it  
All of the memories so closed to me just fade away  
All this time you were pretending so much for my happy ending.  
  
Nice to know you were there  
Thanks for acting like you care  
And making me feel like I was the was the only one  
Nice to know we had it all  
Thanks for watching as I fall  
And letting me know we were done.  
  
You were everything, everything that I wanted  
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it  
All of the memories so close to me just fade away  
All this time you were pretending  
So much for my happy ending.
