I been walkin' down the road  
What it means I dunno  
I been walkin' down the highway  
With the bad food flyin by me  
I' m an ordinary man  
With a time bomb in my hand  
It keeps tickin' an I keep runnin  
Tryin to find out where I come from  
And there ain' t nothin' gonna take this road away  
Nothin' gonna take this road away  
Nothin' gonna take this road outta my heart  
Nothin' gonna take this pain outta my heart  
  
I wake up sweatin in the night  
Every town is only lights  
I 'm addicted to the highway  
'cause I just can' t do things their way  
And there ain' t nothin gonna take this road away  
Nothin gonna take that road away  
Nothin gonna take that road outta my heart  
  
highway I'm doin fine  
You help me draw the line  
No use in bein alive  
If I'm just rentin  
I undersand the circus well  
I've played the clown when down he fell  
But bein' down ain' t bein' loser  
So just look out here comes a bruiser  
And there ain 't nothin gonna take my road away  
Nothin' gonna take my road away  
Nothin' gonna take my road outta my heart
