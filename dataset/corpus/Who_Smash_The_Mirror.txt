Mother:  
  
You don't answer my call  
With even a nod or a wink  
But you gaze at your own reflection!  
You don't seem to see me  
But I think you can see yourself.  
How can the mirror affect you?  
  
Can you hear me  
Or do I surmise?  
That you fear me can you feel my temper  
Rise.  
  
Do you hear or fear or  
Do I smash the mirror.  
Do you hear of fear or  
Do I smash the mirror? Smash!
