Good golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and a rollin'  
Can't hear your mamma call  
  
From the early early mornin' till the early early night  
You can see Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue lights  
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your mamma call  
  
Well, now mamma, papa told me: "Son, you better watch your step."  
If you hear my mamma talking you'll remember what she said  
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call  
  
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call  
  
Yeah, I'm going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring  
Would you hug me and a-kiss me, make me ting-a-ling-a-ling  
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call
