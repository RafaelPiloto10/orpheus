Last night I watched him sleeping  
My body pressed to him  
And then he started speaking  
The name I heard him speak was Kim  
Yes I know that this was years ago  
But when moonlight fills my room I know  
You are here still  
  
I still  
I still believe  
You will return  
I know you will  
My heart  
Against all odds  
Holds still  
  
Yes, still  
I still believe  
I know as long as I can keep believing, I'll live  
I'll live  
Love cannot die  
You will return  
You will return  
And I alone know why  
  
(In a bedroom on the other side of the world, in America. A woman is  
Sitting beside Chris who is sleeping. She is Ellen, Chris's wife)  
  
Last night I watched you sleeping  
Once more, the nightmare came  
I heard you cry out something  
A word that sounded like a name  
And it hurts me more than I can bear  
Knowing part of you I'll never share  
Never know  
  
But still  
I still believe  
The time will come  
When nothing keeps us apart  
My heart, forever more  
Holds still  
  
(Chris wakes up from his sleep with a cry. Ellen takes him in her  
Arms and calms him)  
  
It' s all over, I' m here  
There is nothing to fear  
Chris, what' s haunting you?  
Won' t you let me inside  
What you so want to hide!  
I need you too!  
  
For still I will hold you all night, I will make  
It all right  
I still believe you are safe with me  
As long as I and I wish you could tell what you don't  
Want to tell  
Can keep believing, I'll live what your hell must be  
  
I'll live you can sleep now  
You will return you can cry now  
And I know why I'm your wife now  
I'm yours for life  
Until we die until we die
