Inside her silver house, alone  
She sings a song  
Of water turned to sand  
She waits, her time is her own  
Inside her looking glass  
Black is the color she sees  
While waiting for the sun  
She lives, so patiently  
Young man travelling along  
Passes by a window  
Singing a song  
Feel the wind blow  
As my blood flows  
Through the shadows  
Of my soul, today  
See the rainbows  
As my love grows  
My heart knows  
What my mind won't say  
The living is easy  
I'm born to be free  
The living is easy  
There's no reason to explain  
Sitting in her sitting room, patiently  
She waits for a change, suddenly  
Oh, the changes come  
Hearing a song, her blood begins to flow  
She no longer is alone  
Lying in her sitting room, silently  
He touches her hand, joyfully  
And so love has begun  
With joy in her heart  
She receives his flowing soul  
And love grows  
And it grows  
And it grows  
Inside her purple house  
Oh Lord, filled by her man  
A child begins to grow  
Oh Lord, who can understand
