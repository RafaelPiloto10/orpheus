They were standing in a crowded station,  
So unaware,  
Of all the people there!  
I didn't mean to hear their conversation,  
But anyone could tell,  
It was their last farewell!  
  
Good-bye Sue,  
All the best of luck to you!  
You've been my only gal,  
what's more, my best pal!  
  
Please don't cry,  
Smile until the clouds roll by!  
Don't kiss me dear, just walk away,  
Or I could never ever say,  
Good-bye, good-bye Sue!  
  
(Good-bye Sue) My little Sue!  
(All the best of luck to you!) Good luck to you!  
(You've been my only gal,  
what's more, my best pal!  
My best pal!)  
  
Please don't cry,  
Smile until the clouds roll by!  
Don't kiss me dear, just walk away,  
Or I could never ever say,  
Good-bye, good-bye Sue!
