Ho Ho Ho  
Ho Ho Ho  
Like Guns N Roses with Axel Rose spittin'  
Ozzie's black eyes and the bats that he's bitten  
Big Marshall stacks and a broken E-string  
These are a few of my favorite things  
Ho Ho Ho  
Penthouse apartments and twelve in a hot tub  
Drinking Jack Daniels while getting a backrub  
Little gold chains pinned to brass nipple rings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
We like bar fights  
We like nose rings  
We like eating snails  
We always indulge in our favorite things  
No wonder our skin's so pale  
Girls in black leather with tight little tushes  
Tattoos on big bosoms of prickly rose bushes  
Silver stretch limos that come when I ring  
These are a few of my favorite things  
We like bar fights  
We like nose rings  
We like eating snails  
We always indulge in our favorite things  
No wonder our skin's  
Jingle hell's bells  
Ho Ho Ho
