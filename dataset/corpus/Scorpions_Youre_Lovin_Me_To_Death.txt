It's your move  
I'm in pain  
I'm a pawn  
In your game  
It's your life  
I just happen to be in it for a while  
  
Oh, you're lovin' me to death  
You're killin' me with kindness  
What's behind this sudden tenderness  
  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death  
  
When you touch  
Can you feel  
Is your heart  
Only made of steel  
When you cry  
Do you ever let emotions  
Break your stride  
  
Oh, you take away my breath  
Your unexpected hunger  
Makes me wonder  
What the hell comes next  
  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death  
  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death
