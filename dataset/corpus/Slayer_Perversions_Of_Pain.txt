You better learn my name  
Cause I'm the one insane  
And I'm a constant threat  
You run in fear from my dark silhouette  
Inside my violent mind  
Chaos is all you'll find  
Anarchy uncontained  
Bear witness to the scorn of my campaign  
  
Perversions of pain  
Seep from my eyes  
Into your brain  
Visualize  
  
Within my world of hate  
Disruption I instate  
Malicious entity  
Defile and desecrate humanity  
Alone they all will die  
Corroding from inside  
With no one left to save them  
As I'm dancing on the fucking graves  
  
Perversions of pain  
Seep from my eyes  
Into your brain  
Visualize  
  
Take a look into my mind  
Where pleasure is refined  
Endless burning holes  
Of scarred souls  
Step inside my world of hate  
Where everything mutates  
Your senses under siege  
Ingest the virtues I feed  
A higher level of pain  
Is racing through my veins  
There's nothing more intense  
Than mental misery that I dispense  
So follow right along  
Observe a fresh new dawn  
Of super sensation  
My realm of torture stimulation  
  
Perversions of pain  
Seep from my eyes  
Into your brain  
Visualize  
  
You better learn my name  
Cause I'm a man insane  
Inside my violent mind  
Chaos is all you'll find  
Within my world of hate  
Disruption I instate  
Alone you all will die  
Corroding from inside  
Follow right alone  
Observe a fresh new dawn  
Racing through my veins  
A higher level of pain  
Higher level of pain  
Higher level of pain
