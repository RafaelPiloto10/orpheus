2, 3, 4, 1, drank all my fuckin' brew  
And I ain't got's no more  
Feeling so damn tired  
Running on desperate fumes  
For the end is always near, now  
Empty handed it's always soon  
Psychocise me, terrify me  
Jeopardizing all that's mine  
Megolamize me, certify me  
On my knees until I cry  
Lord only knows where I've gone  
Lord only knows where I've been  
In a world of trouble again worries  
Streaming 'round the bend  
Treat me like a dog, now  
Knowing I won't turn  
Blind me like a slave, now  
Cast down no concern
