28 days of rain  
Flash floods in February  
Back in our boats again  
Bath water and the baby  
What am I gonna do?  
There's been a lot of drinking  
Looking at ghosts of you  
While all the world is sinking  
  
10.000 miles into the atmosphere  
My body shakes  
Is there a welcome here?  
  
Closest thing to heaven  
How do you do it?  
Closest thing to heaven, heaven  
  
Throw your arms round the world  
Make love your destination  
Here we go boys and girls  
Act like a generation  
Give me that ball and chain  
By now it must be hurting  
Dragging your feet again  
Just like a beast of burden  
When one and one and one make two  
I know I'm high because I've captured you,  
yeah  
  
Closest thing to heaven  
Yeah, it's you  
Closest thing to heaven, heaven  
  
Look the world right in the eye  
Eat the countries that are making billions  
Sweet as homemade apple pie  
Saved by crumbs for all the starving millions, yeah  
  
Closest thing to heaven  
Closest thing to heaven  
How do you do it?  
Closest thing to heaven  
Hey  
Closest thing to heaven
