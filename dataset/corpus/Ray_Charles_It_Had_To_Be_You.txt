It had to be you.  
It had to be you.  
I've wandered around,  
Finally found somebody who,  
Could make me be true.  
Whoa whoa whoa could make me be blue.  
And, even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you  
  
Some others I've seen, might never be mean.  
Might never be cross.  
Or, try to be boss.  
But, they wouldn't do.  
For nobody else gave me a thrill.  
With all your faults I love you still.  
It had to be you.  
Wonderful you.  
It had to be you  
  
'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill.  
With all yo' faults  
I love you still now.  
And it had to be you.  
It just had to be you.  
It had to be you
