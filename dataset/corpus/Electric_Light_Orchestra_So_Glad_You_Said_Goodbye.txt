Stepping out of the shadows  
Im blinded by the light  
Therell be no more wasted days  
No more sleepless nights  
  
Stepping out of your shadow  
I finally see the light  
No more mister nice guy  
Im ready for the fight  
Weight off my shoulders  
No more tears to cry  
The chains are broken now  
I see through your disguise  
  
Chorus 1  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
Do you really think I'd just lay down and die  
  
No infatuation  
I don't believe your lies  
I can see clearly now  
The truth behind your eyes  
Weight off my shoulders  
No more tears to cry  
The chains are broken  
I see through your disguise  
  
Chorus 2  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
No more angry words, no chance for you to lie  
Did you really think I'd just lay down and die  
  
Passion fades away  
Love can turn to hate  
And all the words I want to say  
Are left in the hands of fate  
  
Chorus 2
