Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone  
But watch it break when I get you alone  
Take a chance, come lay down with me  
Oh, I wanna make it  
  
Slow and steady never lost the race  
Don't stop runnin', I'm a fool for the chase  
Play the game, surrender to me  
Baby, I don't wanna fake it  
  
Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire?  
Comin' like thunder, you know you make me walk the wire  
  
It's so easy to put on a show  
Your body says yes but you won't let it go  
But my passion it won't slip away  
  
You got me, I'm cornered, my back to the wall  
No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all  
I'm walkin' the wire, I stumble and fall  
I got the message but I ain't gonna crawl
