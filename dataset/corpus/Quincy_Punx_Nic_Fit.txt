  
Sitting in my room  
And I find I'm outa smokes.  
All my money went to beer  
So now I'm fucking broke  
Need a drag of something  
So I'm digging through the couch.  
I roll up all the butts  
From every ashtray in the house  
I got a couple shitty smokes  
But there's still a case of beer  
I haven't gone this long  
Without a smoke in fucking years  
With all this speed that's in my brain.  
If I don't get some cigarettes  
I'm gonna go insane.  
Nic-fit! Nic-fit!  
Nic-fit! Nic-fit!  
Nic-fit! Nic-fit!
