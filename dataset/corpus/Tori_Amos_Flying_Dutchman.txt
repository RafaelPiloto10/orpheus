Hey kid, I got a ride for you  
They say your brain is a comic book tattoo  
And you'll never be anything  
What will you do with your life  
That's all you hear from noon till night  
  
Take a trip on a rocket ship baby where the sea is the sky  
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out-a-sight  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
  
Straight suits, they don't understand  
She tried, that one, with the alligator boots but the other side drew her in  
Heart falling fast when she left, even the Milky Way was dressed in black  
  
Take a trip on a rocket ship baby where the sea is the sky  
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out-a-sight  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
  
'Cause they can't see what you're born to be  
They can see me  
They can't be  
What they can't believe  
They can see what you see  
  
They'll keep the boy spinning in their own little world ah.  
Tie him up so he won't say a word  
They'll keep the boy spinning in their own little world  
So afraid he'll be what they never were
