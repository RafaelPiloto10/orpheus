I tumble into space, try to stop the fall  
My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space  
  
Could have floated  
  
I stumble 'round my home  
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one  
Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down  
My friends are aliens and I've been down  
Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life  
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces  
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down  
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down  
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out  
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own  
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down  
My friends are aliens and I've been down  
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in and deals and I've
been down
