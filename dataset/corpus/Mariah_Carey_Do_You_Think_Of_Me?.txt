(oo-oo, ahh) ooo-oo, woah  
(woah-oh-oh-oh) ahh-ah  
(do-do, do-do, do-do) do-do-do, yeah  
(do-do, do-do, do-do) oh-oh-oh  
  
I wonder if you think of me  
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind (ooo-oo)  
Although our love could never be  
I find I think about you all the time (mmm, baby)  
  
Am I in your fantasies?  
The way you always wander into mine (ooo-oo)  
And are you longing endlessly?  
Just like me, deep inside (oh baby, baby)  
  
When the nights are dark and cold  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
And when you're lying all alone  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
  
(oo-oo) I picture you embracing me  
We drift away and leave the world behind (baby)  
But it's only make-believe  
Love can be, so unkind (oh baby, baby, baby)  
  
When the nights are dark and cold (ooo)  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
And when you're lying all alone (ooo, baby)  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (oh-oh-ooo)  
  
Hey, tell me babe, 'cause I need you babe  
Really want you baby, oh baby, and oh  
  
When the nights are dark and cold  
Do you think of me? (oh-oh) Do you think of me?  
And when you're lying all alone  
Do you think of me? (woah) Do you think of me?  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (baby, baby, baby)  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? (you-oo) Do you think of me?  
  
When the nights are dark and cold (I, need you so much)  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (when I'm lying all alone baby)  
And when you're lying all alone  
Do you think of me? (oo-baby) Do you think of me? (tell me do you-oh-oh-oh)  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (baby, baby, baby, baby)  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (yeh)  
  
'Cause I think about you baby, I'm lying all alone, yeh  
I think about you, yes I do
