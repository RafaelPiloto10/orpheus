Calling up the promised land  
Johnny Seven's coming over the sea  
He's taking your time  
When you want to be free  
  
Holding out a helping hand  
Are you ready for a real career?  
Will you be so cool  
When it's happening here?  
  
It don't say nothing that I haven't heard  
If what I hear is true  
You won't keep the law with a broken word  
So what are you going to do?  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Pass the message around the world  
The medium is in retreat  
The power is here  
And packing some heat  
  
Sell your soul to a holy war  
Set the captive free  
We make no promises anymore  
But it isn't fooling me  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
You can't keep the wheels turning anymore  
With anger, blood and fear  
Or make any friends with an M16  
When you blast your way through here  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Driving the world is going to be a steal
