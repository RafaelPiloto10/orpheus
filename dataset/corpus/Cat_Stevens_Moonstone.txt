Well, first I have to tell you that I'm not insane  
And that once I was a famous archaeologist named  
In a recent expedition in a distant land.  
I just happened to be passing my hand in the sand  
  
And then I stopped, looked, and then I was hooked.  
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone,  
Then the mist started, started to clear.  
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone,  
And then it started to disappear  
  
Well, I walked and walked and never talked  
For many days,  
And without a friend a desert is a lonely place.  
I was just about to turn around and make way home  
When something told me that I had to see it again.  
  
And then I stopped, looked, and then I was hooked.  
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone,  
Then the mist started, started to clear.  
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone,  
And then it started to disappear.  
  
A vu ray, a vu ray.  
A vu ray.  
  
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone  
Then the mist started, started to clear  
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone  
And then it started to disappear,  
And then it started to disappear,  
And then it started to disappear.
