I know You love  
me I know You died for me  
I know You care  
I know You care  
  
I know You live again  
Your life for all my sin  
Now I stand here in  
In Your grace again  
  
As I look into the sky above  
Wonder how my life has changed  
Wonder how Your love, it came to me  
As I look into the sky above  
All my fears, so far away  
All I hear is heaven calling me  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do
