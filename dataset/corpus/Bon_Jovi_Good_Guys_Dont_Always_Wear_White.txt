You say you don't like my kind  
A bitter picture in your mind  
No, it don't matter what I say  
I hear you bitchin' when I walk away  
I'll never be what you want me to be  
You tell me I'm wrong but I disagree  
I ain't go no apology  
Just because I don't look like you, talk like you, think like you  
Judge and jury, a hangman's noose  
I see them in your eyes  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
You judge a man who don't stand in line  
Just because he ain't on your side  
You know the man who wears those shoes  
If you cut me don't I bleed like you? (You know I do)  
  
I don't know what you've been told  
Can't buy guts with a pot o' gold  
A rich man's poor if he got no soul  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, king  
All that shit don't mean a thing  
Do you know which one's behind those eyes?  
It's all a disguise  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
Hey baby, whose side you on?  
You think you got it all figured out where we belong  
Forget all about your dark from light  
Day from night  
Wrong from right  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
Tell your Mama, baby  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Don't always wear, don't always wear  
Don't always wear, don't always wear  
Don't always wear, don't always wear  
White
