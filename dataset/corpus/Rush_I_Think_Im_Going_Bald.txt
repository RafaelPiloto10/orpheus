I looked in the mirror today  
My eyes just didn't seem so bright  
I've lost a few more hairs  
I think I'm going bald  
I think I'm going bald!  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
We would sit and talk of dreams all night  
Dreams of youth  
And simple truths  
Now we're so involved  
So involved with life  
  
Walk down vanity fair  
Memory lane everywhere  
Wall Street shuffles there  
Dressed in flowing hair  
  
The wire!  
  
Once we loved the flowers  
Now we ask the price of the land  
Once we would take water  
But now it must be wine  
Now we've been  
And now we've seen What price, peace of mind  
Take a piece of my mind  
  
My life is slipping away  
I'm aging every day  
But even when I'm grey  
I'll still be grey my way
