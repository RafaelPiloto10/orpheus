Love spreads her arms  
Waits there for the nails  
I forgive you boy  
I will prevail  
  
Too much to take  
Some cross to bear  
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic  
She's over there, yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
She didn't scream  
She didn't make a sound  
I forgive you boy  
But don't leave town  
  
Cold black skin  
Naked in the rain  
Hammer flash in the lightning  
They're hurting her again  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen  
  
I have a dream  
I've seen the light  
Don't put it out, and she's alright  
Yeah, she's my sister  
  
She didn't scream  
She didn't make a sound  
I forgive you boy  
But don't leave town  
  
Cold black skin  
Naked in the rain  
Hammer flash in the lightning  
They're hurting her again  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen  
  
Let me put you in the picture
