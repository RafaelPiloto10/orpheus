Care not for the men who wonder  
Straw that broke your back, you're under  
Cast all them aside who care  
Empty eyes and dead end stare  
  
Pre-chorus:  
Don't you know that none are blind  
To the lie, and you think I don't find..  
what you hide?  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
  
For the horse you've grown much fonder  
Than for me, that I don't ponder  
As the hair of one who bit you  
Smiling bite your own self, too  
  
Pre-chorus:  
And I think that you're not blind  
To the ones you left behind..  
I'll be here  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun.. AAH!!  
  
So be yearning all your life  
Twisting, turning like a knife  
  
Pre-chorus:  
Now you know the reasons why  
Can't get high, or you will die..  
Or you'll die  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
So your sickness weighs a ton  
And God's name is smack for some
