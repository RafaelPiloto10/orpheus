Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian,  
With nothing to return to but the demons in their caves  
  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian afloat upon the waves  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian,  
And the children in the fields all sowing seed and chaffing wheat  
Oh, to be Prince Caspian with stumps instead of feet  
  
Oh to be Prince Caspian  
Oh to be Prince Caspian  
Oh to be Prince Caspian
