Oh baby please, I'm on my knees  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
  
I scheme all night and I dream all day  
I'm so paranoid someone's gonna take you away  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away  
  
I see your face and I hear your name  
Give me one chance and no-one's gonna take you away  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away  
  
Oh baby please, I'm on my knees  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
Oh baby please, it's always been a dream  
If it's really me don't stop me now  
Oh baby please don't stop me now  
  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away  
You look surprised and I'm so amazed  
But don't let true love fade away
