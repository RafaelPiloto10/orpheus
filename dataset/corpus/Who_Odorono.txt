She sang the best she'd ever sang  
She couldn't ever sing any better  
But Mister Davidson never rang  
She knew he would forget her  
  
She'd seen him there  
And put herself to ransom  
He had stared  
He really was quite handsome  
  
She had really looked her best  
She couldn't ever look any better  
But she knew she'd failed the test  
She knew he would forget her  
  
Triumphant was the way she felt  
As she acknowledged the applause  
Triumphant was the way she'd felt  
When she saw him at the dressing room door  
  
She was happier than she'd ever been  
As he praised her for her grace  
But his expression changed, she had seen  
As he leant to kiss her face  
  
It ended there  
He claimed a late appointment  
She quickly turned  
To hide her disappointment  
  
She ripped her glittering gown  
Couldn't face another show, no  
Her deodorant had let her down  
She should have used Odorono
