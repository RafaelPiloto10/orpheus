Where it grows on trees  
But never blooms  
Where it hurts the least for whoever  
Saw it first  
First to go and the last to know  
Lasts longer than a lifetime  
Takes the least amount of effort  
Feels better than a bargain  
Just to know it's there So I don't have to see the light  
Can't you see  
There's only one me  
And that me is me  
I know where but I cannot share  
You'll call me, I'll stand in line till then  
I'll be waiting  
Can't you see  
All circuits are busy  
Please try back again
