DJ's got the party started, there's no end in sight  
Everybody's movin' to the rhythm that's inside  
  
It's a crazy world  
But tonight's the right situation  
Don't get left behind  
  
I can feel the music moving through me everywhere  
Ain't no destination, baby, we don't even care  
  
There's a place to be  
If you need the right education  
Let it take you there  
  
Just go with the magic, baby  
I can see it there in your eyes  
(I can see it there in your eyes)  
  
Let it flow and stop the waiting  
Right here on the dance floor  
Is where you gotta let it go  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Can you feel the music?  
DJ's got us going around, 'round  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Find your own way to it  
Listen to the music  
Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now  
  
You can touch the moment, almost feel it in the air  
Don't know where we're goin, baby, we don't even care  
  
Ain't no mystery  
Just use your imagination  
Let it take you there  
  
Just go with the magic, baby  
I can see it there in your eyes  
(I can see it there in your eyes)  
  
Let it flow and stop the waiting  
Right here on the dance floor  
Is where you gotta let it go  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Can you feel the music?  
DJ's got us going around, 'round  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Find your own way to it  
Listen to the music  
Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now  
  
Forget about your fears tonight  
Listen to your heart  
Let's just touch the sky  
(Listen to your heart)  
  
No need to reason why  
Just listen to the sound  
Let it make you come alive  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Can you feel the music?  
DJ's got us going around, 'round  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Find your own way to it  
Listen to the music  
Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now  
  
Baby now  
Baby now  
  
And DJ's got us moving around  
Right around, right around  
DJ's got us moving around
