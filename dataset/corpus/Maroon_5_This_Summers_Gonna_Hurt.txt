[Hook]  
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker  
Fucker  
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker  
Fucker  
  
[Verse 1]  
Her body's hot  
Her body's like the summer  
I'm in a trance or something  
Her mind is not, no  
As sharp as all her diamonds  
She must be smoking something  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I see her dancing in the streets  
Sipping champagne on the beach  
So expensive when she eats  
Cause she's so fancy  
I see her when I go to sleep  
I check my phone when I am weak  
She never posts anything deep  
Cause she's so fancy  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2]  
She wants it all  
She's always taking something  
And now I'm left with nothing  
I'm ripping off, oh  
I'm ripping off that bandage  
Because I just can't stand it  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
I see her dancing on a fool  
Like she's seventeen and cool  
She really thinks that she can move  
But it's just nasty  
I see her when I go to sleep  
I check my phone when I am weak  
She never posts anything deep  
Cause she's so fancy  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Middle Eight]  
Has to have it all  
Chases every star  
She's so popular  
(Whoo!)  
Has to have it all  
Chases every star  
She's so popular  
(Ohh)  
  
This summer's gonna hurt  
It's gonna hurt  
  
I see her dancing in the street  
Sipping champagne on the beach  
So expensive when she eats  
Cause she's so fancy  
Cause she's so fancy  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
