Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul,  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
Come on baby and a listen to this, this is a something you just can't miss  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
  
Come on baby while the thrill is on, come on baby rock me all night long  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
Come on baby just a close the door, come on baby lets a rock some more  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
  
Feels so good when you're home come on baby rock me all night long  
Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul,  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
Feels so good when you're home come on baby rock me all night long  
  
Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul,  
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long  
Come on baby let the good times roll [Repeat: x4]
