Hated by all and everywhere he goes  
Blazing contempt for human life and lies  
Murder as art and what he knows he knows  
From life and fear in other people's eyes  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love is crazy love is kind  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
She walks the boulevard without a care  
Knowing too much but having come so far  
Pretending life is just a game you play for nothing  
Loving no one and no where  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love goes crazy given time  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
She looks as if expecting a surprise  
Maybe an encounter that will change her life  
Not knowing hot from cold or good for bad  
If life is just a joke or if it makes her sad  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love is crazy love is kind  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love goes crazy given time  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind
