I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful  
I may be wrong but I think you're swell  
  
I like your style, say, I think you're marvelous  
But I can't see, so how can I tell?  
  
All of my shirts are unsightly, all of my ties are a crime  
If dear in you I've picked rightly, it's the very first time  
  
You came along, say, I think you're wonderful  
I think you're grand but I may be wrong  
  
I may be wrong but I think you're swell  
But I can't see, so how can I tell?  
  
All of my shirts are unsightly, all of my ties are a crime  
If dear in you I've picked rightly, it's the very first time  
  
You came along, say, I think you're wonderful  
I think you're grand but I may be wrong
