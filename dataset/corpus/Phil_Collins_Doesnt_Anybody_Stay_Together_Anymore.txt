You keep on walking so you don't fall down  
It's the same old story  
You keep on hiding so you can't be found  
It's the same old story  
Oh but I know you, you're the one who ran  
You know why, it's because you can, oh  
It's alright, 'cause I don't mind  
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why  
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
  
My friends keep falling and they can't get up  
It's the same old story  
Well one says white and the other one black  
It's the same old story  
And I don't know why you keep emotions walled up  
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up  
But it's alright, 'cause I don't mind  
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why  
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
  
Things can change, from a misunderstanding  
Nobody talks, nobody hears, oh oh oh  
Makes me wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
  
You keep on looking for that higher ground  
It's the same old story  
Your glass is empty and the chips are down  
It's the same old story  
But I don't know why, your emotions walled up  
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up  
But it's alright, 'cause I don't mind  
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why  
  
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
