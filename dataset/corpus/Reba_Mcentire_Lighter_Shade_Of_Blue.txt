I guess it finally dawned on me you're gone  
Well maybe I can make it on my own  
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call  
And some nights I don't dream of you at all  
  
Your memory's still hurtin' deep inside  
That's something I'm still learnin' how to hide  
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two  
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Lookin' down the line sometimes  
I think I see a change  
But then I think again and think of you  
Here and there I've turned a stone  
But the mountain hasn't moved  
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
I'm still afraid of turning out the light  
And it takes all my strength to face the night  
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth  
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue  
  
[Chorus]
