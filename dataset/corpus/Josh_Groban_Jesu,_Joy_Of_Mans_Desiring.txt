Jesus, joy of man's desiring  
Holy wisdom, love most bright  
  
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring  
Soar to uncreated light  
  
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned  
With the fire of life impassioned  
Striving still to truth unknown  
Soaring, dying round Thy throne  
  
The original song continues with these words:  
Through the way where hope is guiding  
Hark, what peaceful music rings  
Where the flock, in Thee confiding  
Drink of joy from deathless springs  
Theirs is beauty's fairest pleasure  
Theirs is wisdom's holiest treasure  
Thou dost ever lead Thine own  
In the love of joys unknown)
