Featuring Deep E  
Written by Alan Parsons and David Pack  
  
I know you're out there  
'cause I can feel ya  
Yeah I can feel ya trying to pull me down  
I know your kind  
You kinda like it  
When people tell ya not to come around  
Here's looking at ya  
Been nice to know ya  
I see the lines written on your face  
I wish you well  
But I gotta tell ya  
Ain't nothing human 'bout the human race  
  
You can run  
But you can't look behind you  
You can hide  
But the truth's gonna find you  
  
Some people fight it like some disease  
They carry secrets to an early grave  
They try to fake it  
While on their knees  
Never knowing what they really crave  
They got no values  
They got no soul  
No sense of purpose  
Nothing to believe  
Call me your friend  
Then steal me blind  
To me you're nothing but a common thief  
  
You can run  
But you can't look behind  
You you can hide  
But the truth's gonna find you  
Holding us within this maze
