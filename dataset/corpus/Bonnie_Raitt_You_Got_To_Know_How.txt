You can make me do what you wanna do  
But you got to know how,  
You can make me cry, you can make me sigh,  
But you got to know how,  
You can make me do like this, you can make me do like that,  
Woh, baby, but you got to know how.  
Once a pal of mine stole a guy of mine,  
But I got him back, now,  
It's the same old song, she couldn't keep him long,  
'Cause she didn't know how.  
Well, I love my man, I make him holler,  
Woh, my,  
Yessir, I really know how.  
Technique ain't tough, if you care enough,  
You can learn to know how,  
I might drop a hint how to strike my flint  
If you yearn to know how,  
Well, don't tell me about the life you led,  
Don't try to drink me into bed,  
No, baby, no, that ain't the way how.  
You got to take your time, you know it ain't no crime  
If it lasts all night.  
I think you'll be ideal when you begin to feel  
That you're doin' right.  
When you love me right, you hear me holler,  
Woh, my,  
Yessir, when you really know how.  
(instrumental break)  
And if you stay with me, who knows how it will be  
When we finally know how,  
We'll get a house in town, no need to move around  
When we really know how,  
Well, there's tricks that I don't even know,  
Ones we'll make up as we go.  
Woh, mister, when we really know how.  
Yes, mister, when we really know how.
