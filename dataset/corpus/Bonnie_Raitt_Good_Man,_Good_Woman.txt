Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey  
Midnight, I'm wound up tight  
Slowly comin' down in the daytime  
I been lyin' low from work, hangin' over from the hurt from you babe  
But I'm gonna suffer through the strain, till I get a  
Better thing with you, Darlin', me and you.  
So far to see ahead  
When I can't seem to drag myself out of bed  
Gotta find me a good man, a good man, a good man.Yeah.  
You better stop, think about what you're saying  
I was seriously dedicated, in the game of playin'  
You made ten thousand promises you could'nt keep  
I forgave you when you lied, pleaded and weeped  
Put up with your disrespect and neglect  
What an experience, I'll never forget.  
Till now, everything I did was wrong. (I'm sorry, baby)  
Today you're free, but we live alone.  
Gotta find me a good woman...Good woman...Good woman...Yeah.  
It was twelve o'clock in the midnight hour  
I heard the door slam, and then the shower  
When I got up, you were already gone  
I slipped and fell, from the water you left on.  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man.
