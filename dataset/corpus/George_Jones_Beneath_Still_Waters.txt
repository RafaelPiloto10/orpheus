Beneath still waters  
There's a strong undertow.  
The surface won't tell you  
What the deep water knows.  
  
Darling, I'm saying  
I know something's wrong.  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone.  
  
Even a fool could see  
That you'll soon be leaving me.  
But each and every heart  
Must share there turn for misery.  
  
This time it's me  
And I'll cry alone.  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone.  
  
Even a fool could see  
That you'll soon be leaving me.  
But each and every heart  
Must share there turn for misery.  
  
And this time it's me  
And I'll cry alone.  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone.  
  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone
