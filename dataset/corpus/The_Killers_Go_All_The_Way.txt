Chorus:  
Go all the way  
It feels so right (feels so right)  
Being with you here tonight  
Please go all the way  
Just hold me close (hold me close)  
Don't ever let me go  
  
I couldn't say what I wanted to say  
Till she whispered I love you  
  
Chorus:  
So please, go all the way  
It feels so right (feels so right)  
Being with you here tonight  
Please go all the way  
Just hold me close (hold me close)  
Don't ever let me go  
  
Before her love, I was cruel and mean  
I had a hole in the place  
Where my heart should have been  
But now I've changed,  
And it feels so strange  
I come alive when she does,  
All those things to me...  
And she says  
  
(Come on) come on,  
(Come on) come on  
(Come on) come on  
(Come on) come on  
  
I need you (come on)  
I love you (come on)  
I need you (come on)  
  
Chorus:  
Please go all the way  
It feels so right (feels so right)  
Being with you here tonight  
Please go all the way  
Just hold me close (hold me close)  
Don't ever let me go
