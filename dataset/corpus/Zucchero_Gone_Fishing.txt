What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you? What's it cost you?  
Not very much  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row  
  
I got this girl who waits back on the shore, oh, Lord  
Sees me row, says she don't know what for, that's all  
Ain't got no fish when I'm at her door  
But in the morning when I leave she's begging for more, and more  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope, that's all  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row, yeah  
  
This cat and mouse game surely must end, oh, Lord  
Catch all the fish, who'll left to be friends? That's all  
Back home it's too tough I can't cope  
But in the land of fish, I know someday I will be home  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope, I do know  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row  
  
What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you, darling?  
What's it cost you? What's it cost you?  
Not very much  
  
Everybody must get drunk  
  
I got no people here on my boat  
Just a hot jug of wine and a net full of hope  
I got no money but I'm still afloat  
Lost my luck to the wind so I row and I row  
  
Everybody must get drunk
