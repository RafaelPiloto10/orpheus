I hear voices from beyond the veil  
They reverberate in mystery  
There are shadows in my heart  
And they multiply in memory  
  
And the comrades that I've lost out there  
In the scattered ruins still speak to me  
  
If the flickering light of your campfire dims  
The world grows smaller  
It's closing in  
I'm standing here  
And I want you to live  
  
I know  
  
These are the times we find out who we really are  
This will be when a true friend stands at your side  
Someone like me who wants to  
Believe in the days of high times and innocence  
Drawing the lines and shouting back to the night  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
And from those who've seen the light beyond  
We know the end will bring tranquility  
But the voices of the friends they heard  
Brought them back to this reality  
  
Tough the beacon of light in your life seems dim  
The sun's coming up on the world we're in  
There are choices here  
And I want you to live  
  
I know  
  
These are the times we find out who we really are  
This will be when a true friend stands at your side  
One more like me  
Who wants to believe in the truth of all we experienced  
To live again to jump back into the fight  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
Pouring light from the sky  
Portends you and I  
Disappears in the night  
  
I still remember  
  
I hear voices from beyond the veil  
Like a faint unfinished symphony  
  
Though the beacon of light in your life seems dim  
The sun's coming up on the world we're in  
I'm standing here  
And I want you to live  
  
I know  
  
These are the times we find out who we really are  
This will be when a true friend stands at your side  
One more like me  
Who wants to believe in the truth of all we experienced  
To live again to jump back into the fight  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
I want you, I want you, I want you to live  
I want you, I want you, I want you to live  
I want you to live  
  
I still remember.
