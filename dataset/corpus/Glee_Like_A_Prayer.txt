Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.  
I hear you call my name and it feels like  
Home  
  
When you call my name, it's like a little  
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there  
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power  
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there  
  
I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing  
I have no choice, I hear your voice, feels like flying  
I close my eyes, oh God, I think I'm falling  
Out of the sky. I close my eyes  
Heaven help me.  
  
When you call my name, it's like a little  
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there  
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power  
Just like a prayer  
You know I'll take you there.  
  
Like a child, you whisper softly to me  
You're In control just like a child, now I'm dancing.  
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning.  
You're here with me, it's like a dream  
Let the choir sing.  
  
When you call my name, it's like a little  
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there  
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power  
Just like a prayer  
You know I'll take you there  
(Repeat)  
  
(Oooh ohhh... Ohhh)  
Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.  
I hear you call my name and it feels like home.  
  
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there  
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery  
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem  
Just like a prayer, no choice,  
Your voice can take me there.  
  
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there.  
It's Like a dream to me.  
(Repeat)  
  
Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.  
I hear you call my name and it feels like home.  
  
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there  
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery  
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem  
Just like a prayer, no choice,  
Your voice can take me there  
(Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there)  
  
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem  
Just like a prayer, no choice,  
Your voice can take me there.
