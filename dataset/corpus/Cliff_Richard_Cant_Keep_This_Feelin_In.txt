I just got to tell someone about the way I feel  
Shout it from the rooftop to the street  
And if I spread the word please tell me who's it gonna  
Hurt  
I'm in love with you girl  
Let me talk to the world  
I feel like I'm up there riding a rocket to the moon  
And I'm gonna tell them where I've been  
  
Can't keep this feelin' in  
Not for another minute  
I can't hold it back  
You know I'm trying to  
I just gotta count the ways  
You bless my days  
Baby I can't keep this feelin in  
  
Some things should be private just between  
The two of us  
Trust me when I say my lips are sealed  
My god It's no big secret that I'm crazy  
For your love  
Want to put up a sign that the lady is mine  
If you're superstitious I'm gonna try to  
Hold it down  
But I'm going out there on a limb  
Can't keep this feelin' in  
Not for another minute  
I can't hold it back  
You know I'm trying to  
I just gotta count the ways  
You bless my days  
Baby I can't keep this feelin in  
  
I know it's better if we take it slow  
That's when the hours feel like years  
I've gotta tell somebody that's all I know  
If I've gotta whisper whisper in their ears  
  
Repeat chorus out
