Am I really here in your arms  
Its just like I dreamed it would be  
I feel like we're frozen in time  
And you're the only one I can see  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life  
  
And I never really knew how to love  
I just hoped somehow I'd see  
Asked for a little help from above  
Send that angel down to me  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life  
  
I never thought that I could feel a love so tender  
I never thought I could let those feelings show  
But now my heart is on my sleeve  
and this love will never leave  
I know  
I know  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life  
All my Life  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life
