Something inside of me  
is taking it hard each day  
Something inside of me  
is making me feel this way  
Whenever you're near me, you've got me thinking of you  
  
Something about your eyes  
won't let me look away  
Something about your smile  
that's making it hard to say  
Whenever you're near me, you've got me thinking of you  
  
You know, you've got me singing a song  
Whenever you're around me I just want to belong  
To you, I would give all of my love  
I wish that I could tell you all what I'm thinking of  
  
Something inside of me  
won't let me begin the day  
Something inside of me  
is making it hard to say  
Whenever you're near me, you've got me thinking of you
