I packed it all on a whim  
Threw an old Hank cassette tape in  
Dad's '84 rusty Ford  
He swore we'd never make it  
I quit my job, let my momma down  
Broke an angel's heart on the way out  
Of town  
Pulled my roots from the ground for  
The hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer  
Tells you everything you have that's worth losin'  
Damn country music  
You might get lost in the lights  
The things that keep you up all night  
Whiskey straight 3 a.m.  
Chasin' songs in your head  
It's the sweetest highs, the lowest lows  
Needin' yes and hearin' no  
Just another so-so  
Believe me i know  
It's the hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
It'll take you, break you  
Damn sure make you  
Do things you never thought you'd be doing  
Damn country music  
When the money, the fame  
The lights on your name  
All fade away  
Well you'll still be a slave to  
The hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer  
Tells you everything you have that's worth losing  
Damn country music  
Damn country music
