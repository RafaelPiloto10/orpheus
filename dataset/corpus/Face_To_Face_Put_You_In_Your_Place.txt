What was that you said to me?  
I'm not exactly sure I heard you right  
What is it you want from me?  
I'm not exactly sure I will comply  
  
You think you've got me where you want  
You think you're better but you're not  
I don't mean anything to you  
Why?  
  
Don't make me put you in your place  
You don't think I'd let you make a fool of me  
Don't make me put you in your place  
You don't think I'd let you make a fool of me  
  
What do you expect from me?  
Are you really looking for a fight?  
What do you expect to see?  
For me to lose control, I think I might
