Cosette  
I saw him once  
Then he was gone  
We were like dreamers at night  
Who meet as in a trace, then part again!  
Two phantoms in the shadows of the moon  
Can people really fall in love so soon?  
He walked alone  
He seemed alone like me  
Could he have known  
That moment was my destiny?  
I had to run away,  
And it was like a dream  
  
I saw him once  
The dream was true  
  
I saw him once,  
And once will do!
