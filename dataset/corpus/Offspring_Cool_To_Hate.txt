I hate a lot of things  
I hate a lot of people that are lame  
I like to hate stuff  
'Cause then I don't havae to try and make  
  
A change  
I hate teachers  
I hate school  
I hate the cheerleaders  
  
And anyone who's cool  
I hate the office  
I hate the Quad  
Don't want to learn nothing  
I want to be a slob  
  
It's cool to hate  
It's cool to hate  
I don't like nothing and I like that fine  
(Liking something's just a waste of time)  
  
It's cool to hate  
It's cool to hate  
I don't like nothing and I like that fine  
(Liking something's just a waste of time)  
  
I don't like nothing and like that fine  
(Liking something's just a waste of time)  
Yeah I hate everything  
I even hate you too  
So fuck you  
  
I'm always thinking bad  
I never have nothing good to say  
I'd rather tear things down  
Than build them up  
  
It's easier that way  
I hate the jocks  
And I hate the geeks  
I hate the trendies  
  
But I also hate the freaks  
I hate Dr. Martens  
And Muscle T's  
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery  
  
I'll cut you down and give you lip  
Being positive's so unhip  
I'll cut you down cause I'm a fool  
Being positive's so uncool  
  
I hate the jocks  
And I hate the geeks  
I hate the trendies  
But I also hate the freaks  
  
I hate your band  
And I hate TV  
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery
