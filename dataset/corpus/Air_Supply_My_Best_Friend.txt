You're here looking like my best friend  
Hoping you'll find a way  
To tell me you just can't stay  
  
You laughed hard at the world, I know  
Now that the seasons show  
To tell me, love, your heart will soon mend  
  
We counted everyday  
Only to show we needed each other  
Who needs a reason to love  
When friends just seem to know  
They know it  
  
You have lots of dreams, I know  
Now it's the close of the show  
Let's hope it'll all passes by in the end  
So get yourself along  
You're my best friend
