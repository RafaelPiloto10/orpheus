As the dealer dealt the cards to everyone,  
I could see that I was free.  
I had an ace of hearts, the dream of every man,  
And I could see my destiny.  
I can not justify the way I play,  
But only see them as they fall.  
  
The diamond jack  
Black magical lady luck,  
Who will show me the way.  
When you have your freedom  
Without worldly care,  
Around human share.  
Along the way there's evil waitin' for you,  
And there's no judge and jury, but yourself.  
When you're tired to the bone  
Remembrance gone,  
And you have cast your dice,  
Take your chances as they come, one by one,  
The hand of fate is as cold as ice.
