We're gonna break out the hats and hooters  
When Josie comes home  
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters  
When Josie comes home to stay  
  
We're gonna park in the street  
Sleep om the beach and make it  
Throw down the jam till the girls say when  
Lay down the law and break it  
When Josie comes home  
  
When Josie comes home  
So good  
She's the pride of the neighborhood  
She's the raw flame  
The live wire  
She prays like a Roman  
With her eyes on fire  
  
Jo would you love to scrapple  
She'll never say no  
Shine up the battle apple  
We'll shake 'em all down tonight  
  
We're gonna mix in the street  
Strike at the stroke of midnight  
Dance on the bones till the girls say when  
Pick up what's left by daylight  
When Josie comes home  
  
When Josie comes home  
So bad  
She's the best friend we ever had  
She's the raw flame  
  
The live wire  
She prays like a Roman  
With her eyes on fire
