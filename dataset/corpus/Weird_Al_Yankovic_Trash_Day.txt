It's rotten, so rotten here  
So rotten, ah, oh!  
  
It was like, the last day before trash day (uh)  
My place was gettin' kinda nasty (uh)  
Even know the garbage I knew would reak (ya know)  
Thought that I could leave it for one more week  
Then I, I'm takin', birthday cake (oh) and chile and greasy old bacon  
Throw in all on top of the mess I've been makin'  
Wife so mad she start to shakin'  
Leaky bag and now the girl is gaggin'  
She's naggin', I need you to get that stuff of the kitchen floor (oh)  
Is that too much to ask you for (oh)  
But I see no reason why, I can't let a few more weeks go by (uh uh)  
And that garbage is piled up high, and buddy you should see the flies  
I said  
  
[Chorus]  
There something rotten here (say what)  
You better hold your nose (oh)  
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, oh  
Boy there's a lot in here (a lot)  
And everyday it grows (oh)  
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh, make you  
Want to throw up  
  
Look at all this garbage that I keep generatin' (come on)  
I sit around all day and watch it biodegrating  
Bet there's a hundred house codes that I'm violatin'  
Even my dog passed out and need resusatatin'  
You won't believe it, take a whiff of that aroma  
Sure to put you in a coma  
It's so messy can't find my toenail clippers  
It's so bad the roaches wearin' slippers  
Worn, sweatly clothes, pile up in this joint  
Stand up by themselves at this point  
It's so filthy now baby I can't lie  
I wipe my feet before I go outside  
I wonder what crawled in here and died  
Ya know, walkin' around barefoot actin terrified  
But it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends, like  
Hey I think them rats gettin' big (oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
There something rotten here (say what)  
You better hold your nose (oh)  
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, oh  
Look what we got in here (now what)  
Let's watch it decompose (oh)  
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, make  
You want to throw up  
  
With a little bit a  
And a little bit a  
Make me want to throw up  
It makes you want to  
Just makes you want to  
Oh  
  
Some Lysol, some Comet, I got a mop and its got your name on it  
(What?) I'm just kiddin' dogonit  
(Oh) Unless your gonna do it  
Careful not to (ay) breathe the fumes  
The garbage piles are goin' all the way to the bathroom  
Turn in to toxic waste sometime this after noon  
Better get a Hazmat suit and a push broom  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
There something rotten here (say what)  
You better hold your nose (oh)  
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, oh  
Its kinda pot in here (tear pot)  
Bring out the fire hose (oh)  
(Hey you disgusting slob, you better take the trash out)uh uh uh uh, make  
You want to throw up  
  
With a little bit a  
And a little bit a  
Make me want to throw up  
Give a little bit a  
And a tiny bit a  
Make you want to throw up  
Mix a little bit a  
With a molecule of a  
Make me want to throw up  
It makes me want to  
Just makes me want to  
Oh!
