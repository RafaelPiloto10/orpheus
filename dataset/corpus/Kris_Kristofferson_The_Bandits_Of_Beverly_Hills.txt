The knew the moment their eyes came together  
They'd never need to explain  
He was a bandit behind his behavior  
She was precisely the same  
Laughing and dancing those gay cabralleros  
They looked so wild and so free  
She likes him a little light on the loafers  
But bless his heart, so does he .  
Chorus:  
And he covers for her and she covers for him  
If it's wild and they want to they will  
But the dangers are real and the chances are slim  
And there ain't nothing cheap but the thrill  
In the badlands of beverly hills.  
He had a mustache that made him look macho  
And she wore a mole on her cheek  
Making the run around rodeo avenue  
Dancing boutique to boutique  
And the truth is a question with too many answers  
And so hard to face on your own  
Beauty is only as deep as the skin  
Ugly goes clear to the bone.  
Chorus:  
And he covers for her and she covers for him  
If it's wild and they want to they will  
But the dangers are real and the chances are slim  
And there ain't nothing cheap but the thrill  
In the badlands of beverly hills.
