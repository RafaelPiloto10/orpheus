The telephone, the telephone  
I have an idea  
Women always have ideas  
Hello  
Here is Agamemnon  
Here is Agamemnon  
Who? Wrong connection  
This is  
I am a moralist  
An anti-militarist  
I am against duels  
I cannot stand seeing  
A fly in rage  
I cannot look at  
A uniform or blood  
That woman has seduced me  
And now I am done for  
Darling, where shall I  
Hide you in a hurry?  
Here is Agamemnon  
Here is Agamemnon  
I am coming  
Directly from the trenches  
And look forward  
To a solemn luncheon  
Oh, my nerves  
I'm losing my find  
This damned telephone  
Spoils my favorite position  
And no I can start  
Writing poetry again
