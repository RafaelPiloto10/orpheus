We don't want no killing Lord  
I don't want to see my brother die  
We don't want no killing Lord  
I don't want to to see my sister cry  
I don't want to see  
I don't want to see I I I I I  
I know that bad things are going down  
I, I know that loneliness is all around  
I know that the world is starved for love  
Love  
Why know that there's good  
And there's evil  
And there's evil  
Disguised as good  
They're knocking at my door  
They're knocking at my door  
Don't let them in  
Don't let them in  
I think it's the Milwaukee Police  
I think it's the police  
I think it's the polizei  
I think it's the polizei I I I  
Everyday everyday everyday everyday  
I need your love love  
And it's a bad bad score  
And I need you all the more  
I need your love  
Love
