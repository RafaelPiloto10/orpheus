Junk food, radio, all the news and nowhere to go

Hold on you got me coming like a shot now from a gun  
I said hold on, I'm your hero, x rated number one  
Tough boys, hot boyz, come on baby feel the noise  
Tough guys rough guys no room for a compromise  
Shifting metal, six string steel gonna move you like a (------)  
Fire it up feel the pain I'm gonna hit you like a runaway train  
Rock boys hot boys come on baby feel the noise  
Tough boys, rough boys, no room for a compromise  
Rock boyz, hot boyz, I'm gonna give you some bad bad noise  
Tough guys rough guys no room for a compromise
