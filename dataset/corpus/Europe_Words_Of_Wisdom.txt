So many words have passed through my mind  
Never thought I'd be so blind  
Wish I could understand you  
So many things I've heard and seen  
But still don't know what you mean  
  
When you say "I'm leaving you"  
I wish I could remember  
Everything I've learnt  
I've tried and tried to be so good  
And I know I should  
Say something before you go  
Cause every time I've done something wrong  
It's so hard to be strong  
  
Gone are the feelings I want to show  
(Oh) Words of wisdom, (Oh) teach me more  
(Oh) Words of wisdom, (Oh) so much more
