First time, first love  
Oh what feeling is this  
Electricity flows  
With the very first kiss  
Like a break in the clouds  
And the first ray of sun  
I can feel it inside  
Something new has begun  
And it's taking control  
Of my body and mind  
It began when I heard I love you  
  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
  
This life, this love  
All the sweetness I feel  
So mysterious yet  
So incredibly real  
It's an uncharted sea  
It's an unopened door  
But you gotta reach out  
And you gotta explore  
Even though you're not sure  
Till the moment arrives  
There he is and you know you're in love  
  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
  
And baby when I met you  
Every feeling I had was new  
I don't think there are words  
To describe the sensation  
  
It's an uncharted sea  
It's an unopened door  
But you gotta reach out  
And you gotta explore  
And when something happens  
That words can't define  
Only then do you know you're in love  
  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
For the very first time
