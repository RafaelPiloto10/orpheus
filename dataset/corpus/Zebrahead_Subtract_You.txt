Another day  
Another Clean Break  
Another Cigarette and I think I'm gonna be okay  
Some other way  
Some other mistake  
Some other reason saying that you are never gonna stay  
  
You are the plug and I am the socket  
You are the rock and I come to rock it  
You see the truth when I bring the bullshit  
You make me whole when i feel alone  
  
Hands to the sky  
Why you want to go and roll by me?  
Hands to the sky  
Why you got to go now?  
  
Cracked in two  
I'm in you  
I'm standing on this bridge and you're to blame  
Count to two  
Subtract you  
I'm jumping from this bridge and you're to blame  
  
Let's get away  
Let's give in tonight  
Let's put the blanket on the sand I think we'll be alright  
Inside a place  
I know you're all mine  
Inside a crowded room your smile reminds me I'll be fine  
  
You are the drug and I'm feeling higher  
You sell your soul and I am the buyer  
You're a b-boy record and I'm the DJ  
You do what you want when I want it my way  
  
Hands to the sky  
Why you want to go and roll by me?  
Hands to the sky  
Why you got to go now?  
  
Cracked in two  
I'm in you  
I'm standing on this bridge and you're to blame  
Count to two  
Subtract you  
I'm jumping from this bridge and you're to blame
