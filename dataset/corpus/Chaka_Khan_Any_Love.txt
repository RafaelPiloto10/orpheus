You go out every night as a single  
But you don't really know what to do  
You see someone that you'd like to mingle  
And imagine that she is waiting for you  
  
Chorus:  
Any love that you feel  
Is real  
Any time that you use love  
You lose love  
  
There is no certain crowd that you run with  
But your passions they never run thin  
You say 'hi', they say 'hi' and it's done with  
Still you don't really love from deep within  
  
Chorus  
Batted eyes and bitter tears  
Price you pay for all the years  
Of holding back what's deep inside  
And living with a hell of a lot of lies  
  
Chorus
