Written by Kirk Franklin  
  
This is to my friend above  
Who shows me so much love and grace  
By placing a smile upon my face  
It's so hard to express the way I feel  
About a man who can heal your life  
By dying on a cross  
For sinners who were lost  
Lord, I love you so much  
That I'm yearning for Your touch  
  
This is to my friend above  
Who shows me so much love and grace  
By placing a smile upon my face  
It's so hard to express the way I feel  
About a man who can heal your life  
By dying on a cross  
For sinners who were lost  
And while I'm here today  
There's just one thing that I want to say  
  
Chorus  
Watch over me and protect me  
From the things I cannot see  
Let Your loving arms surround me  
From here to eternity  
Lord I need Your anointing  
So my spirit can be free  
Lord I need You more,  
And more and more, and more  
  
Repeat  
  
I need You more and more  
I need You more and more  
Repeat 2x's
