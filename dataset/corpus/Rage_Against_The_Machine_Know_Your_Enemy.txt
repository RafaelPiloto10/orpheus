Huh!  
Yeah, we're comin' back then with another bombtrack  
Think ya know what it's all about  
Huh!  
Hey yo, so check this out  
Yeah!  
Know your enemy!  
Come on!  
  
Born with insight and a raised fist  
A witness to the slit wrist, that's with  
As we move into '92  
Still in a room without a view  
Ya got to know  
Ya got to know  
That when I say go, go, go  
Amp up and amplify  
Defy  
I'm a brother with a furious mind  
Action must be taken  
We don't need the key  
We'll break in  
  
Something must be done  
About vengeance, a badge and a gun  
Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system  
I was born to rage against 'em  
  
Fist in ya face, in the place  
And I'll drop the style clearly  
Know your enemy...Know your enemy!  
Yeah!  
  
Hey yo, and dick with this uggh!  
Word is born  
Fight the war, fuck the norm  
Now I got no patience  
So sick of complacence  
With the D the E the F the I the A the N the C the E  
Mind of a revolutionary  
So clear the lane  
The finger to the land of the chains  
What? The land of the free?  
Whoever told you that is your enemy?  
  
Now something must be done  
About vengeance, a badge and a gun  
Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system  
I was born to rage against 'em  
  
Now action must be taken  
We don't need the key  
We'll break in  
  
I've got no patience now  
So sick of complacence now  
I've got no patience now  
So sick of complacence now  
Sick of sick of sick of sick of you  
Time has come to pay  
Know your enemy!  
  
Come on!  
Yes I know my enemies  
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me  
Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission  
Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite  
All of which are American dreams
