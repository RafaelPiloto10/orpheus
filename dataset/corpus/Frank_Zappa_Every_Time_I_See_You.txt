Every time I see you...  
Whenever you walk by,  
I want to hold you.  
Darling, please let me try.  
Darling, I love you,  
I really do.  
Darling, I want you.  
Let me be true.  
I want to hold...  
Every time I see you.  
  
If you would love me...  
We'd never, never part.  
We would be lovers...  
Heart unto heart.  
Darling, I love you...  
I really do.  
Darling, I want you...  
Let me be true.  
I want to hold you...  
Every time I see you
