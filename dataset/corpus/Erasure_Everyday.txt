Everyday, it's a gettin' closer  
Goin' faster than a roller coaster  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
A-hey a-hey hey  
  
Everyday, it's a gettin' faster  
Everyone said go ahead and ask her  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
A-hey a-hey hey  
  
Everyday seems a little longer  
Every way, love's a little stronger  
Come what May, do you really long for  
True love from me?
