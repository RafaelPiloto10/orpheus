Hey what do you see  
Its not me not me  
Why won't you share  
It's not fair  
There's a bicycle show  
Where the bicycle's float  
And I wouldn't of cared  
I won't be the one who bothers you  
I won't be the one who lets you down  
Now that you're there  
You're not scared  
Why would you care  
It's your dream  
Not theirs  
There's a cigarette thief stealing cigarette disease  
I wish I was there
