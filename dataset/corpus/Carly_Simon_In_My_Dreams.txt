The only place I hang my hat is in my dreams  
The only time I feel at home is in my dreams  
The only place I'm not alone is in my dreams  
The only place I recognize is in my dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
That's the only place I know  
To wander to and fro  
I move about and go  
As slow as time will let me go  
  
Sometime I'll only dream and I'm not scared of that  
I'll move through farther galaxies, wear other hats  
  
Trip on a wink, an inkling of a shadow fill  
An eclipse in less than half a blink  
Where you love me still  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
As slow as time will let me go  
Let me go, let me go
