Woke up, it was a Chelsea mornin'  
And the first thing that I heard  
Was the song outside my window  
And the traffic wrote the words  
It came ringin' up like Christmas bells  
And rappin' up like pipes... and drums...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll wear it 'til the night comes  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea mornin'  
And the first thing that I saw  
Was the sun through yellow curtains  
And a rainbow on my wall  
Red, green and gold to welcome you  
And crimson crystal beads... to beckon...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
There's a sun shower every second  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea mornin'  
And the first thing that I knew  
There was milk and toast and honey  
And a bowl of oranges too  
And the light poured in like butterscotch  
And stuck to all my senses...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll talk in present tenses
