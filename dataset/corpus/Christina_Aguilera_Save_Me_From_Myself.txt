It's not so easy loving me  
It gets so complicated  
All the things you've gotta be  
Everything's changin'  
But you're the truth  
I'm amazed by all your patience  
Everything I put you through  
  
When I'm about to fall  
Somehow you're always waitin'  
With your open arms to catch me  
You're gonna save me from myself  
From myself, yes  
You're gonna save me from myself  
  
My love is tainted by your touch  
'Cause some guys have shown me aces  
But you've got that royal flush  
I know it's crazy everyday  
Well, tomorrow may be shaky  
But you never turn away  
  
Don't ask me why I'm cryin'  
'Cause when I start to crumble  
You know how to keep me smilin'  
You always save me from myself  
From myself, myself  
You're gonna save me from myself  
  
I know it's hard, it's hard  
But you've broken all my walls  
You've been my strength, so strong  
  
And don't ask me why I love you  
It's obvious your tenderness  
Is what I need to make me  
A better woman to myself  
To myself, myself  
You're gonna save me from myself
