[Chorus]  
All clear wail the sirens  
Sunshine on the wasteland  
Old man sitting in the white sand  
Think we're in for a big surprise  
Right between the eyes  
  
Seemed a good idea  
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here  
Only one man could be seen  
And he was old and so serene  
Captain sat in his deck chair  
And the red light flashed Beware  
Pilot felt quite big-time  
As the bomb sailed through the air  
Well, they danced and sang  
When the bang went bang  
When the lights popped out  
And the smoke began to clear  
It was positively queer  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Die" said the General  
"Cobblers" said the man  
So the Pentagon sent a cable  
And the Queen a telegram  
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones  
Ripped apart that sand  
'Til the stench was just revolting  
And the sky a greenish tan  
But the soldier said "Sir,  
There's a crack in the world"  
And the figures went "squash",  
And the bits flew far and wide  
How the universe sighed!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When the smoke had blown away  
There was nothing left to view  
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you  
Floating high up in the sky
