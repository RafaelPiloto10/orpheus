You got my pride  
Hanging out of my bed  
You're messin' around with my life  
So I bought my lead  
You even mess with my children  
And you're screamin' at my wife, baby  
Get off my back,  
If you want to get outta here alive  
  
Freedom, give it to me  
That's what I want now  
Freedom, that's what I need now  
Freedom to live  
Freedom, so I can give  
  
You got my heart  
Speak electric water  
You got my soul  
Screamin' and howlin'  
You know you hook my girlfriend  
You know the drugstore man  
But I don't need it now  
I was trying to slap it out of her head  
  
Freedom, so I can give  
Freedom, yeah  
Freedom, that's what I need  
You don't have to say that you love  
If you don't mean it  
You'd better believe  
If you need me  
Or you just want to bleed me  
You'd better stickin' your dagger in someone else  
So I can leave  
Set me free  
(Yeah)  
  
Right on, straight ahead  
Stay up and straight ahead  
Freedom
