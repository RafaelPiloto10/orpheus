Chorus:  
Oh no, I'm not the one you see  
So don't you go confusing me  
I've got a different mentality  
I'm trying to be drama free  
You stress me out and that's the truth  
I don't want no substitute  
For the peace of my mind that comes to me  
Cause I'm living drama free  
Can you give me one bit of rest?  
Gotta say you didn't pass the test  
I thought about it but you aint Gods best  
Youre just not what I need  
Tried to run a stupid game on me  
I'm not blind I see quite clearly  
Can't have you disrespecting me  
So I'm gone just like the breeze  
Can you give me just one bit of space?  
Girl I love you but you're driving me insane  
Gossiping always into trouble and then  
You want me to justify  
Tired of hearing stories, he said, she said  
Tired of hearing bout the crazy things you did  
Would you listen to me just once or twice?  
Make a difference in your life  
But you don't now  
Bridge:  
I've made changes I know you see  
No more old this is my new leaf  
Leaving behind all that's stressing me  
Needlessly, drama free  
(Oh oh oh) Can you hear me?  
(Oh oh oh) Can you feel me?  
Its not that I don't care about it  
Its just that I've got to do without it  
(One) My choice to just be done  
(Two) Hope I made it clear to you  
(Three) Something that works for me  
(Four) don't want the drama no more
