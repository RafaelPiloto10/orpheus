I never lie  
To myself  
Tonight.  
  
Rose, tinted eyes  
Color my sorrow  
A shade of white  
  
Bye bye black balloon  
See you real soon  
Wave bye bye  
Bye bye  
  
Why were you so sad  
What have they done?  
Forget those mindless baboons  
They're off playing God  
  
Copy cats in cheap suits  
All playing it safe  
While cannibals with their noose  
Consume a parade  
  
Is it wonderful?  
  
Kalopsia, kalopsia, kalopsia  
Kalopsia, kalopsia  
  
Far, far from shore  
The land of nightmares  
Gone forever more  
  
And I love you more  
Than I can control  
I don't even try  
Why would I?  
  
Oh why the long face?  
You've got it all wrong  
Forget the rat in the race  
We'll choke chain them all  
  
Fates favor the ones  
Who help themselves  
The rest feel the sting of the lash  
As they run, as they row  
The boat to hell  
Row
