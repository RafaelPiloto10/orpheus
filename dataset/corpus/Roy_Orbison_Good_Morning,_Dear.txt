Were the nights any sweeter  
The mornings any cooler, when she was here?  
Or was the mind grown accustomed  
To hearing "Good morning Dear"?  
Should I still feel all the sunshine  
That remembering brings to mind with my thoughts of her?  
Lord, we both know things could never be the way they were  
Her little girl illusions  
Built the wall of confusion between right and wrong  
That stands between her  
And the dream I had cherished so long  
Now faded and tattered  
Once all that mattered when she was here  
And a mind grown accustomed  
To hearing "Good morning dear"  
Were the nights any sweeter  
The mornings any cooler, when she was here?  
Or was the mind grown accustomed  
To hearing "Good morning Dear"?
