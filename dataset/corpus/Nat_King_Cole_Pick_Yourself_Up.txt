Pick yourself up,  
Take a deep breath,  
Dust yourself off  
And start all over again.  
  
Nothing's impossible, I have found  
For when my chin is on the ground.  
I pick myself up,  
Dust myself off  
And start all over again.  
  
Don't lose your confidence  
If you slip  
Be grateful for a pleasant trip  
And pick yourself up,  
Dust yourself off  
And start all over again.  
  
Work like a soul inspired  
Until the battle of the day is won.  
You may be sick and tired,  
But you'll be a man, my son.  
  
Will you remember the famous men  
Who had to fall to rise again  
They picked themselves up  
Dust themselves off  
And start'd all over again.  
  
Work like a soul inspired  
Till the battle of the day is won.  
You may be sick and tired,  
But you'll be a man, my son.  
  
Will you remember the famous men  
Who had to fall to rise again?  
So take a deep breath  
Pick yourself up  
Dust yourself off  
And start all over again.
