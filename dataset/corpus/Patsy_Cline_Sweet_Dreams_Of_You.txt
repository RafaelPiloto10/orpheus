Sweet dreams of you  
Every night I go through  
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew  
Instead of having sweet dreams about you  
  
You don't love me, it's plain  
I should know I'll never wear your ring  
I should hate you, the whole night through  
Instead of having sweet dreams about you  
  
Sweet dreams of you  
Things I know can't come true  
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new  
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
