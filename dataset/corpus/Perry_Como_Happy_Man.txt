There's a road that someday I'm gonna walk down,  
If I ever find the time!  
I'll dig my toes in that warm and friendly sand,  
And I'll be all through dreamin' yeah,  
Feelin' just like laughin'  
Be a very happy man!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
There's a song that someday I'm gonna sing,  
If I ever find the time!  
And I'll throw back my head and sing just like a songbird,  
And I'll be all through dreamin' yeah,  
Feelin' just like laughin'  
Be a very happy man!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
Time grows short and I haven't done a thing,  
Time grows short for the dreamer and his dream,  
Well a man who won't take a chance,  
He never finds the way,  
But for the dreamer,  
Tomorrow is never today!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
There's a girl that someday I'll say hello to,  
If I ever find the time!  
I'll touch her hair and look into her eyes,  
And I'll be all through dreamin' yeah,  
Feelin' just like laughin'  
Be a very happy man!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la!  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! ( fade out )
