I know your life on earth was troubled  
And only you could know the pain  
You weren't afraid to face the devil  
You were no stranger to the rain.  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Son, your work on earth is done  
Go to heaven a shoutin'  
Love for the Father and the Son.  
  
Oh, how we cried the day you left us  
We gathered round your grave to grieve  
I wish I could see the angels faces  
When they hear your sweet voice sing.  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Son, your work on earth is done  
Go to heaven a shoutin'  
Love for the Father and the Son.  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Son, your work on earth is done  
Go to heaven a shoutin'  
Love for the Father and the Son.  
  
Go to heaven a shoutin'  
Love for the Father and the Son...
