I'm going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair  
Going down to the river gonna take me my rocking chair  
And if those blues don't leave me  
Gonna rock on away from here  
  
If you want me woman please don't act so shy  
If you want me woman please don't pass me by  
I love those sideways glances  
Your shoulder and your thigh  
  
I see inside your eyes, the Baba's Sai  
The reasons why I love you  
  
So if you're still busy hiding  
What it is you've got  
If you're frightened of losing  
What you like a lot  
You may be cruisin' backwards  
While thinking that you're not  
  
I see into your eyes, the Baba Sais  
The reasons why I love you  
  
So if you don't get the picture  
You won't know what I feel  
If you don't get the picture  
Then you won't have a depth of field  
You may be going someplace  
Someplace you've already been
