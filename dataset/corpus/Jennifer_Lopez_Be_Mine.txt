Looking at a coffee table book  
At a small cafe on Broadway  
Tryin' to find a way  
Out of all trouble and dismay  
Travelin' on a road unpaved  
Everywhere I look  
There is something there to remind me  
Of feelings from yesterday  
Listening to drama and hearsay  
Only leaves me empty  
  
You are my friend first  
We talk about what hurts  
We talk about love  
Let's talk about us  
Can't you see  
I want you to be mine  
What matters the most  
I just want to see you up close  
When I look into your heart  
You got everything I want  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
I want you to be mine  
  
Turn the music up  
Riding on the highway  
Thinking about the way  
That I feel when I'm with you  
A feeling that continues  
To make me feel good  
Even when I'm not near you  
And I want it to stay  
Emotions, I have so many  
Love can give you plenty  
But I know  
  
You are my friend first  
We talk about what hurts  
We talk about love  
Let's talk about us  
Can't you see  
I want you to be mine  
What matters the most  
I just want to see you up close  
When I look into your heart  
You got everything I want  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
(I want you to be mine)  
  
Everything he does  
All of the the above  
Didn't know it 'til I fell in love  
Fits me like a glove  
Do you know  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
Everything he does  
Fits me like a glove  
Didn't know it 'til I fell in love  
All of the the above  
Do you know  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine...
