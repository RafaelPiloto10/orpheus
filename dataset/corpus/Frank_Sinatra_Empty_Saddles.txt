Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are you rounding up the doggies, the strays of long ago?  
Are ya on the trail to Buffalo?  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do ya ride tonight?  
Are there rustlers on the border or a band of Navajo?  
Are you heading for the Alamo?  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do ya talk tonight?  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do ya walk tonight?  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
My tears would be dried tonight  
If you'll only say I'm lonely as ya carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral
