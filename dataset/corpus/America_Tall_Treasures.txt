Golden rings and hair tied with ribbon  
Early spring when winter's forgiven  
Laughing past pleasures warm by the fire  
Come inside  
Silver vase, take a drink flower petal  
Whistling songs like steam from the kettle  
Carry silence like driftwood that rides  
On the tide, on the tide, on the tide  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Then the night will fall  
Bringing peace to all  
Darkness there together  
Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain  
China cups, some shatter for certain  
Laughin past pleasures warm by the fire  
Come inside  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Red river runs here beside us  
Grey morning will never divide us
