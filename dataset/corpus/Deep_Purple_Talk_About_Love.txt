Talking real world, all that pain  
Try to fix it still comes out the same  
Get down to Rosie's  
Won't you pull that plug  
Last week someone made a mess of that rug  
  
Talking big house way up town  
One day, one day  
I'll put the money down  
All that baby talk, it's for the birds  
Let's make some honey  
Honey in so many words  
  
Oh no  
Don't want a serious conversation  
I just want to get you serious  
Serious  
I want to talk about love  
  
You talk about the weather  
Rain or snow  
Talking cold wind  
The way it's going to blow  
Talking good times night and day  
Talk talk a stronger man  
Could lose his way  
  
Aphrodite now there's a girl  
Good good loving  
She spreads around the world  
Forget your dancing all that boogaloo  
Drag that purse over here  
I got to talk to you
