Will I make it out of here alive  
Will I ever get to see my unborn child  
Will I ever get to live my own dreams  
Cause this hell where I am now just ain't for me  
If I could just kiss you goodnight... Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna... I wanna go home  
I just wanna get along with my life  
I wanna... I wanna go home  
I just wanna get along with my life  
  
Will I have to take a life does that make peace  
They say it's in the name of god that I'm a beast  
I don't wanna stay out here another day... Oh  
I'm just trying to get back home in any way  
How I miss all the good times... Ya ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna... I wanna go home  
I just wanna get along with my life  
I wanna... I wanna go home  
I just wanna get along with my life  
I wanna... I wanna go home  
I just wanna get along with my life... Oh  
I wanna (I wanna be)... I wanna go home (I wanna be)  
I just wanna get along (oh) with my life  
  
I wanna go home  
I wanna get along with my life  
I wanna go home  
I wanna get along with my life  
I... I miss you babe
