You ask me  
How should I be to you ?  
You ask me  
To tell you what to do  
  
You ask me  
How can I make it through ?  
You want me  
But don't know what to do  
  
And I just want you to  
Be true  
  
Just be a woman  
Just be a woman  
  
You ask me  
How can I make you smile ?  
You ask me  
How can I make it right ?  
  
But darling  
Just take a look inside  
The answers are within your own mind  
And I just want you to be you  
  
Just be a woman  
That's all you got to do  
Just be a woman  
  
Just be a woman  
Do what you got to do  
Just be a woman  
That's all you got to do  
  
Just be a woman  
That's all I got to say  
Just be a woman
