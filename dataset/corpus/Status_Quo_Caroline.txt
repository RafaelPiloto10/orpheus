If you want to turn me onto  
Anything you really want to  
Turn me onto your love sweet love  
  
If the night-time is the right time  
Anytime of yours is my time  
We can find time for love sweet love  
  
Come on sweet Caroline  
You're my sweet Caroline  
You know I want to take you  
I've really got to make you  
Come on sweet Caroline  
Take my hand together we can rock-n-roll  
  
When I'm thinking of you sleeping  
I'm at home alone and weeping  
Are you keeping your love sweet love  
  
Do you still care when I'm not there  
Do you really wish I was there  
Can I come there for love sweet love  
  
Come on sweet Caroline  
You're my sweet Caroline  
You know I want to take you  
I've really got to make you  
Come on sweet Caroline  
Take my hand together we can rock-n-roll
