I saw three ships come sailing by  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
I saw three ships come sailing by  
On Christmas Day in the morning.  
  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning?  
  
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
The virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day in the morning
