No no,  
Tell me, tell me.  
  
Keep it on the real,  
(the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real).  
  
Trust is something that we can't live without,  
Honesty must be there, ain't got no room for no doubt.  
Reality can't waste no more of our precious time,  
Trying to escape the pressures of our mind.  
  
I don't ask for much, no no,  
Baby if you want me you gotta tell me something, yeah.  
All I want from you is just to keep it comin',  
Keep it on the real.  
(the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real)  
  
Faithfully I'll give my loving to you,  
Soulfully our spirits will make it through.  
Respect me baby and I'll respect you,  
What more can two lovers do?  
  
I don't ask for much, no no,  
Baby if you want me you gotta tell me something, yeah.  
All I want from you is just to keep it comin',  
Keep it on the real.  
(the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real)  
  
I don't ask for much, no no,  
Baby if you want me you gotta tell me something, yeah.  
All I want from you is just to keep it comin',  
Keep it on the real.  
(the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real)
