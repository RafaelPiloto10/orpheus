You're trying to tell me something  
Every time I come near  
I got a feeling the message  
Is the one I don't want to hear  
You can deny all you want to  
But I know you enough to know  
Why not come right out and say it  
You've been trying to let me down slow  
So let's talk before the tears drop  
  
You've had a change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
You've had a change of heart  
  
Your kiss sends a message  
And I detect the signs  
I got enough understanding  
Of a lover to realize  
That you can't make him love you  
Though I give you my best  
You're keeping your heart at a distance  
And it breaks me up to confess  
  
Change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
Change of heart  
Baby, everyone to talk to  
You've had a change of heart  
  
Is this just a notion  
A phase that will pass  
A mixed up emotion  
Or is this change gonna last?  
  
Baby let's talk  
Before the tears drop  
  
You've had a change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
Change of heart  
Everyone to talk to  
You've had a change of heart  
Am I losing you, losing you  
  
Change of heart  
I couldn't change my heart  
Am I losing you, losing you  
I couldn't change my heart
