Here they come  
These gods of steel  
Megatron  
Devouring what's concealed  
Speed of Death  
Crossfired they stare  
Final breath  
From vaporizing glares  
  
Raised to man oppressed  
Sign of persecution  
  
Hellrider  
Roars through the night  
Hellrider  
Raised for the fight  
  
All incensed  
To overthrow  
Strong defense  
With armaments they grow  
By this quest  
Their fate's renowned  
Put to rest  
Abominations crown  
  
Time to ram it down  
Judgment for the tyrant  
  
Fight undying and eternal  
Wheels bring death and pain infernal  
Honor bound your strength repleted  
To no end they're undefeated  
  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You fought their battle for them  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You brought them through their despair  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
Your tempered steel relinquished  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You slaught them all extinguished  
  
Wrath of doom  
In killing fields  
They consume  
Their valiants never yield  
  
Triumph to the gods  
Vanquished of enslavers  
  
Hellrider  
Breaking their will  
Hellrider  
In for the kill  
  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You fought their battle for them  
Hellrider, Hellrider  
You brought them through it all  
Hellrider
