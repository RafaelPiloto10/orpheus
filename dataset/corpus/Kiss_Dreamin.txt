Close your eyes and take a look at your life  
Do you like what you see  
My eyes are open but I feel like I'm blind, it's all returning to me  
I want to know, does a frozen river flow  
Things you said fill my head lying in a cold and empty bed  
  
I'm only dreaming  
Between the darkness and the light  
I'm only dreaming, oooh  
Dreaming, can't tell the daylight from the night  
I'm only dreaming, dreaming  
  
I feel the sunlight shining down on my face  
Not a cloud in my mind  
I get my wake up but it never comes in time  
My prayers are spoken and I wait to receive  
Cause there's a fine line between the truth and how we want it to be  
  
I'm only dreaming  
Between the darkness and the light  
I'm only dreaming, oooh  
Dreaming, can't tell the daylight from the night  
I'm only dreaming, dreaming  
  
I'm sailing like a ship on the sea  
I don't care if I'm lost in the haze  
I hear the angels singing something to me  
(?)Come dream of me(?), that you never see  
Won't you come slip away  
  
I am only dreaming  
I'm only dreaming (x 6)  
  
Dreaming  
Dreaming.
