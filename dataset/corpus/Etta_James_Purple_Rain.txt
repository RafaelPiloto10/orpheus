I never meant 2 cause u any sorrow  
I never meant 2 cause u any pain  
I only wanted 2 one time see u laughing  
I only wanted 2 see u laughing in the purple rain  
  
Purple rain Purple rain  
Purple rain Purple rain  
Purple rain Purple rain  
  
I only wanted 2 see u bathing in the purple rain  
  
I never wanted 2 be your weekend lover  
I only wanted 2 be some kind of friend  
Baby I could never steal u from another  
It's such a shame our friendship had 2 end  
  
Purple rain Purple rain  
Purple rain Purple rain  
Purple rain Purple rain  
  
I only wanted 2 see u underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing  
It's time we all reach out 4 something new  
That means u 2  
U say u want a leader  
But u can't seem 2 make up your mind  
I think u better close it  
And let me guide u 2 the purple rain  
  
Purple rain Purple rain  
Purple rain Purple rain  
  
If you know what I'm singing about up here  
C'mon raise your hand  
  
Purple rain Purple rain  
  
I only want 2 see u, only want 2 see u  
In the purple rain
