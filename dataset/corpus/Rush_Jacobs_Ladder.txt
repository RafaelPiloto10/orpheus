The clouds prepare for battle  
In the dark and brooding silence  
Bruised and sullen storm clouds  
Have the light of day obscured  
Looming low and ominous  
In twilight premature  
Thunderheads are rumbling  
In a distant overture  
  
All at once,  
The clouds are parted  
Light streams down  
In bright unbroken beams  
  
Follow men's eyes  
As they look to the skies  
The shifting shafts of shining  
Weave the fabric of their dreams
