The only one  
  
I think of you  
And wonder who  
You are and what's your line  
I wonder if  
There's someone else  
Or if it's true that I'm  
The only one  
In your life  
I only worry  
For your own sake  
I don't know much about  
The deals you make  
There's so much that  
You hide from me  
The mystery:  
Am I the only one?  
The only one  
  
(The only one  
The only one  
The only one)  
  
I don't know you  
You don't know me  
I wonder what we share  
It's just that now  
And then you smile  
And suddenly I know you care  
And I'm the only one  
For a while  
Though you've many reasons  
To tell me a lie  
I can't help believing  
That I should be  
For you and you for me  
The only one  
  
(The only one)  
(Only one)  
  
As enigmatic  
As you can be  
I'm not suspicious  
Naturally  
There's so much that  
You hide from me  
The mystery:  
Am I the only one  
In your life?  
  
Though you've many reasons  
To tell me a lie  
I can't help believing  
That I should be  
For you and you for me  
The only one
