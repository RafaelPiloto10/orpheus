She came on like the night and she held on tight  
And the world was right when she made love to me  
We were free  
She moved in like a friend, started loving me  
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms  
But the morning when I woke up  
I was here and she was gone  
Now I'm hanging on  
Maybe you can tell me how a love so right can turn out to be so wrong  
  
Where did she go when I need her close to me  
And the perfect story ended at the start  
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart  
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me  
  
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling  
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling  
I could take it in my stride  
Start living for the moment  
Maybe half the things we sought were never there  
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size  
It isn't really fair
