When my dad thought I had become of age  
He said, "son, you're getting to the lovin' stage"  
  
I said, "oh yeah, oh yeah"  
  
"it's time you stopped being all alone  
You've got to find a girl you can call your own"  
  
I said, "not now, I'll tell you later  
Not now, I'll tell you when  
Not now, I'll tell you later  
When I'm gonna fall in love"  
  
Do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do, yeah  
  
I met a little girl, fine as could be  
I said, "girl, you're the girl that was made for me"  
  
She said, "oh yeah, oh yeah"  
  
I thought if I tried, I just couldn't miss  
So I asked the lil' girl for just one lil' kiss  
  
She said, "not now, I'll tell you later (not now)  
Not now, I'll tell you when (not now)  
Not now, I'll tell you later  
When I'm gonna fall in love"  
  
When it's time for you to fall in love  
It won't make sense for you to hurry  
Take you time and make up your mind  
Cause the surer you are, the less you have to work  
  
Do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do, hey  
  
Not now, I'll tell you later (not now)  
Not now, I'll tell you when (not now)  
Not now, I'll tell you later  
(everybody)  
When I'm gonna fall in love
