God only knows how I've needed a friend  
Who can see the boldness and pride  
Someone strong enough I can put my faith in  
Someone willing to let me inside  
So be a man and be my man  
  
[First Chorus:]  
I dare you to need me  
Like nobody else  
I dare you to feel me  
Like you've never felt  
I dare you to want to want  
To want to be good to me  
Baby you've got your reasons  
Dangling from kite strings  
But you can open your hands, let them fly  
Oh I know you won't always say and do the right things  
Oh but some things are worth a try  
So if you can, be my man  
  
[Second Chorus:]  
I dare you to know me  
Like I've never known  
I dare you to show me  
That I can be shown  
Dare you to want to want  
To want to be good to me  
Tell me I,  
Tell me I'm the one who deserves you  
Oh and every time, every time you know that you want to  
I dare you  
  
[Third Chorus:]  
I dare you to hold me  
Like you never will (again)  
Kiss me and leave the world standing still  
Dare you to want to want  
  
[repeat first chorus]
