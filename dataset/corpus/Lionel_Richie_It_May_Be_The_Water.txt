I look at all the things I put you through  
I've often wondered how it bothered you  
I know how close I came to losing you  
But we managed to stay alive  
I guess only the strong survive  
I just gotta tell you baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes love can be so cruel  
Sometimes we learn 'bout being a fool  
I don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long  
It may be the water  
That keeps us strong  
  
I took for granted that you'd always be there  
I know it seemed at times I didn't care  
I didn't know what you had given me  
But with love it takes some time  
But through the joy and pain, you're mine  
I just gotta tell you baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It may be the water  
That keeps us strong  
You know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby  
That it all turned out this way, ?cause you know that  
It almost slipped away, oh baby  
But we managed to stay alive  
I guess only the strong survive  
I just gotta tell you baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby  
That it all turned out this way, cause you know that  
It almost slipped away, oh baby  
But we managed to stay alive  
I guess we found that only the strong survive  
So I just had to tell you baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It may be the water  
That keeps us strong
