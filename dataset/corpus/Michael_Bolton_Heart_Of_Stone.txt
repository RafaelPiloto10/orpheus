Can you hear me  
Now I've found you  
Standing there in the lonely night  
Many times I  
Tried to reach you  
But you closed your doors  
And you closed them tight  
Come down before it's too late  
Anyone can see you're just  
Looking in your eyes  
Tell me you're satisfied  
With the price you must pay  
Everyday, everyday  
  
Chorus:  
Heart of stone  
Heart of stone  
You can't make it on your own  
Heart of stone  
Heart of stone  
You can't make it all alone  
Breaking this heart of stone  
  
Are you dreaming lost forever  
In the fantasy  
That world of your own  
Time is passing now or never  
Can't you see you're  
A long way from home  
Wake up it's been too long  
Won't you see that  
It can't go wrong  
Just can't understand why  
You make it this way  
Everyday, everyday  
  
Chorus:  
  
Ever wonder whoever thinks it's right  
To fill the empty  
Place inside of you never do  
Ever wonder when you're turning 'round  
If everything you need to know  
Is what you're learning from  
It's to you, yeah, yeah  
  
Chorus:  
  
Heart of stone
