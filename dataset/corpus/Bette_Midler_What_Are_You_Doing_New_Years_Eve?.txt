When the bells all ring and the horns all blow  
And the couples we know are fondly kissing  
Will I be with you  
Or will I be among the missing?  
  
Maybe it's much too early in the game  
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?  
  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night?  
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve  
  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose, I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of a thousand invitations you'll receive  
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
