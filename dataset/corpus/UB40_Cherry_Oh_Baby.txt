Cherry oh, Cherry oh, baby,  
Don't you know I'm in need of thee?  
If you don't believe it's true,  
What have you left me to do?  
So long I've been waiting,  
For you to come right in.  
And now that we are together,  
Please make my joy run over.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh ee oh oh ee oh,  
Oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Oh, yeah.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Cherry, oh, Cherry, oh, baby,  
Don't you know I'm in love with you?  
If you don't believe I do,  
Then why don't you try me?  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Never make you wear no frown.  
If you say you love me madly,  
Then I will receive you gladly.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cherry, oh, Cherry, oh, baby,  
Don't you know I'm in love with you?  
If you don't believe I do,  
Then why don't you try me?  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Never make you wear no frown.  
If you say you love me madly,  
Then why do you treat me badly.  
  
[Chorus]
