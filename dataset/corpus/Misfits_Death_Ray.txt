I can't take another stare from you  
I believe that I don't care for you  
I will wait for the end of me  
Time is lost baby can't you see  
  
I can see the death ray  
Within your eyes  
I can see the death ray  
Within your mind  
  
I can't take another stare from you  
I believe that I don't care for you  
I will wait for the end of me  
Time is lost baby can't you see  
  
I can see the death ray  
Within your eyes  
I can see the death ray  
Within your mind  
  
I can see the death ray  
Within your eyes  
I can see the death ray  
Within your mind  
  
I'll approach  
I will see the light  
I will pass much to your delight  
Catch the ray deep inside my brain  
I will live yet another day
