Alright  
Alright  
You sacrificed  
And worked all your life  
But now you're  
Bleeding, crying all for nothing  
Nothing  
You waiting for that day  
And you're always praying  
For the gates  
To finally open, open  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Yeah  
Well you can bring  
And army's might  
But I will always fight  
Until the end, the end  
You can never break  
Through my walls  
And I'll never fall  
What's mine I will defend  
Defend  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
And I will show you  
No mercy  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Yeah  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Well don't believe  
What you have heard  
Just don't believe  
A single word  
Not a word  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my stronghold  
Yeah, Never, no
