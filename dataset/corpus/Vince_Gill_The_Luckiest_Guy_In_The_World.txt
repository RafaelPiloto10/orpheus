I've got a secret I keep in my heart  
A secret that sure makes me smile  
And I've got a feeling deep down in my soul  
That I haven't felt in a while  
I've found somebody that really does love me  
And I know that she'll always stay  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause my heart feels this way  
  
We watch old movies and cry at the endings  
And get lost in each other's eyes  
We hold hands when we're walking and  
Spend all night talking and make love as the sun starts to rise  
She's found somebody that really does love her  
And she knows that I'll always stay  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause her heart feels this way  
  
We share the same hopes  
We dream the same dreams  
Oh lifelong companions I'd say  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause our hearts feel this way  
I'm the luckiest guy in the world  
'Cause our hearts feel this way
