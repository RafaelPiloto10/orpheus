Daytime husler, you're out of line.  
Don't ya try to change my mind!  
Don't you try.  
You see, I ain't no fool.  
No, I can tell,  
Oh, baby, you ain't my kind!  
My kind!  
  
I'm in love with a down home man.  
Simple lovin' I can understand.  
I've been hustled by the best of them,  
And you ain't nothing but a crazy man.  
Hustler.  
  
Oh, daytime hustler, you better look away.  
Because I won't play your game no more.  
No, no more, no.  
You spend all of your money  
On those other women  
Who are blind enough to buy your shame.  
All your shame, oh, oh, oh.  
  
Fancy money doesn't buy me love!  
Flashy Cadillacs won't make me f-ck!

And you ain't nothing but a crazy man.

Yes, I do. yes, I do.  
You just don't, you just don't,  
Ya just don't know  
That you are really,  
You're really not too cool.  
And I believe your mind is slow.  
Oh, oh, oh.  
  
I'm in love with a down home man.  
Simple lovin' I can understand.  
I've been hustled by the best of them,  
And you ain't nothing but a crazy, crazy man.  
Hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler,  
Hustler, hustler, hustler baby.  
Oh, hustler. oh, hustler. oh, hustler.
