Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Came in the door  
Checked in my coat  
And who I'm looking for  
Is staring in my face  
  
They played our song  
We hit the floor  
He held me strong  
And we danced the night away  
  
I can see the way that he is making feel  
This way about his love  
I've been looking for something like this  
I'm saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
If you go left right up down  
Make you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
It's been a long long time  
Since I fell, fell  
Love has found my way oh oh oh  
I've been looking (looking)  
I've been searching (searching)  
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah  
  
Can't deny the way that he is making feel  
This way about his love  
I've been searching for something like this  
I'm saying oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If you feel good  
If you're feeling good  
Put one hand in the air, say yeah  
If you feel good  
If you're feeling good  
It's 'cause love is in the air  
Love is in the air  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
Come on and say...  
  
Come on and say...
