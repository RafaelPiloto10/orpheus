All you need is time  
All you need is time, time,  
Time to make me bend  
Give it a try, don't be rude  
Put it to the test and  
I'll give it right back to you  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
Kick it around, take it to town  
Try to defy what you feel inside  
You better be strong  
Your love belongs to us  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All I need is trust  
All I need is trust, trust,  
Trust to make it show  
I don't want to know everything you done  
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All we need is faith  
All we need is faith, faith,  
Faith to make it nice  
Kick it around, don't be rude  
If you're gonna make a mistake  
Don't you make it twice  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day
