In the valley of the shadows I'm waiting  
For mother and the other ones I love  
So know I'll always love you  
Until we meet above  
  
In the battle of the bottle I'm an innocent  
And the breaking of glass I'm lost  
In the shadow of a downtown overpass  
My last I did exhaust  
  
No no no mother should ever have to lose a son  
No no no mother especially not such a handsome one  
  
In the middle of the meadow I'm waiting  
For mother and the other ones I love  
There's no good why this came to pass  
There's only just because  
  
No no no mother should ever have to lose a son  
No no no mother especially such a handsome one
