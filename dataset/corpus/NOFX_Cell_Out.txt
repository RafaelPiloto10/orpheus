She asked me if I was a singer then called me has-been  
She said she really like my band in the early 90's  
I said stop saying those mean things, my ego is so fragile  
And the she called me a poseur punk  
Why don't I drink up and get the hell out  
'Cause I'm a sellout  
  
That berating kinda bumped me out so I left the prakside  
I walked to my Volvo and noticed I had a couple slashed tires  
But adding injury and insult to vandalism  
Someone took a key to my door and boldly spelled out  
You're a sellout  
  
It says on the side of my car that I'm a sellout  
I play a Korean guitar but I'm a sellout  
I'm a sellout
