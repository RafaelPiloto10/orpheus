I saw a hundred men laughing only two understanding  
A wheel that was spinning for good and for evil  
There was a church bell ringing but nobody listening  
Except the beggars in the doorways of designer perfection  
There was a thin man collecting for a government problem  
He spent a long time waiting with that look of disapproval  
There was icicles forming in the agency windows but nothing for sale there  
Only dreamtime oblivion  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
And there's a tightrop marriage between the doctor and the junkie  
In daylight it's perfect but at night time it's frightening  
The hospital was moved so the hotel could profit  
But nobody stayed up there to curse it or to mock it  
As hi-fi condition arranged for my transport  
But there's nothing to hear except the sound of bloody progress  
The buildings are blushing from the interest they're earning  
But the tables and the chairs on the bombsites are burning  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
Let's have a look, what do you see  
I saw Thatcher and Murdoch those twins of confusing  
Pay Saatchi and Saatchi to keep up their little illusion  
I saw pepsi and my hero both digging a goldmine  
It's funny how money can make you deaf as well as blind  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah. The misery well it brings you down in a recurring dream  
Here on the diamond avenue  
Here on the diamond avenue  
Here on the diamond avenue
