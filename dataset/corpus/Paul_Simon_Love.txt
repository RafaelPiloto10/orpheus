Cool me  
Cool my fever high  
Hold me when I cry  
I need it so much  
Makes you want to get down and crawl like a beggar  
For its touch  
And all the while it's free as air  
Like plants the medicine is everywhere  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
  
We crave it so badly  
Makes you want to laugh out loud when you receive it  
And gobble it like candy  
  
We think it's easy  
Sometimes it's easy  
But it's not easy  
You're going to break down and cry  
We're not important  
We should be grateful  
And if you're wondering why  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
  
The price that we pay  
When evil walks the planet  
And love is crushed like clay  
The master races, the chosen peoples  
The burning temples, the weeping cathedrals
