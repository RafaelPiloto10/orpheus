You won't admit you love me  
And so how am I ever to know?  
You always tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
A million times I ask you  
And then I ask you over again  
You always answer  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
If you can't make your mind up  
We'll never get started  
And I don't wanna wind up  
Being parted, broken hearted  
  
So if you really love me, say yes  
But if you don't, dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps  
  
If you can't make your mind up

But if you don't, dear, confess  
And please don't tell me  
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
