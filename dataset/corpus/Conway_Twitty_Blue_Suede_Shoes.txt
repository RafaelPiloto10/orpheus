Well, it's one for the money, two for the show  
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go  
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Well, you can do anything but get off of my blue suede shoes  
  
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face  
Slander my name all over the place  
Do anything you want to do, but uhh baby, get off of my shoes  
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Well, you can do anything but get off of my blue suede shoes  
  
Well, you can burn my house, steal my car  
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar  
Do anything you want to do, but uhh baby, lay off of my shoes  
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Well, you can do anything but get off of my blue suede shoes  
  
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show  
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go, yeah  
  
Well, blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby  
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah  
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, honey  
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes  
Well, you can do anything but get off of my blue suede shoes
