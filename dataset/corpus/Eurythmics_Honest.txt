Now Jerry was no architect  
But she sure knew how to put out all the lights  
I once watched her walk right  
Through a plate glass window  
And never even look hack  
Now here I am talking about all her good points  
I never did think she had any bad  
Though friends told me she could be cruel  
And vicious  
At one time she was the best friend that I had  
And I hope she can hear  
I hope she feels good  
I hope she was the best or everything  
And I hope she feels like a million dollars  
And I hope she knows I was always honest  
Now Jerry was a main-line angel  
She never came home at night  
She slept where the wind would take her  
In her P. V. C thigh length boots  
Make-up black and solid  
Fingernails bitten by teeth so close  
To perfection only marred by  
Seven years of obvious fake prescriptions  
That were one way or making  
Sure that she never saw the daylight  
Before wearing her sunglasses over  
Breakfast with her Italian girlfriend  
In a post blitz kid stupor  
Saying "How ya doin', Davy boy"  
You know you're such a trooper  
And I hope you feel good  
And I hope you feel like a million dollars  
And I hope you know that I was  
Always.... Honest
