Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry at the doorstep  
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid 'cause this rover, crossed over  
  
If I never had a cent I'll be as rich as Rockfeller  
Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street  
  
With those blues on parade  
Because this rover, it crossed over  
  
If I never had a cent I'll be as loaded as old Rockfeller  
With that gold dust 'round my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
On the side, at that side of the street that is sunny
