I saw your face across the room  
Caught me like a favorite tune  
Talking about my girl on the radio  
(Ooh ooh) I knew I had to say hello  
  
A special moment  
Wonderin' what lies ahead  
Was about to make my move  
When she took my arm and said  
  
We oughta take good advantage  
Of the party lights  
Slip away to the night  
Darling I want you  
To come home with me  
We oughta...  
I wanna...  
  
Girl's got style  
Something a little insane  
Now she's acting like she owns me  
I see no reason to complain  
  
Chorus  
  
Hard as I try, I can't remember why  
We never spent that time together  
She said, Don't bother wanderin'  
Around here tonight  
I see that look in you (look in you)  
We oughta follow through  
Oh it's better late than never  
  
Oh we oughta take good advantage  
Of the party lights  
Slip away to the night  
Darling I want you  
To come home with me  
We oughta...  
  
Take good advantage  
Real good advantage  
Darling I want you  
Darling I want you  
Come home with me  
Take good advantage  
Slip away  
Take good advantage  
Slip away  
Slip away
