Breaking out of school  
Ain't really fooling no one  
I was sure I'd get my reward in time  
Backing on the street  
With the smell of sweet sensation  
Didn't want to be another dime  
Hidden in the pocket  
Of some unfortunate nation  
Didn't have no money, sure didn't have the time  
  
[Chorus:]  
Unfortunate thing, such an unfortunate thing  
Unfortunate thing, such an unfortunate thing  
But I fought with nothing  
But I fought with nothing  
  
Laughing at the rumor  
That you've been screwing someone  
Laugh better cry  
It could be your turn next time  
Brother what a lover beyond the fourth dimension  
He's got an ego  
That's bigger than yours and mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't call me Bwana  
Let it settle in your heart  
We move from children  
Into a business counterpart  
Your head was shaking as I walked into the room  
A spirit breaking  
That's why I feel this way  
  
Breaking out of school  
Ain't really fooling no one  
I was sure I'd get my reward in time  
Backing up a street  
With a smell of sweet sensation  
Didn't want to be another dime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unfortunate thing
