Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate  
Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans  
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent  
Not a minute left for me to be me  
  
Been going like nothing can wait  
I gotta get my priorities straight  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot  
  
Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do  
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath  
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found  
Maybe Miss Wonderful, I haven't met yet  
  
It just hit me like a wrecking ball  
She's giving me a wake up call  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot  
  
Step back, smell the rose  
Feel the sand between your toes  
Unplug, unwind  
Step out in the sunshine  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Take the girl, get a map and pick any ol' dot  
Live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot
