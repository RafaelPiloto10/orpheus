All the people under broken homes  
Don't wanna fight no more  
All the people nursing shattered bones  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in peace  
So we've gotta fight some more  
  
And all these who are in foreign lands  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those those lost their feet or hands  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in peace boys  
We gotta fight some more  
  
hey we don't fight no more  
hey, hey, hey, We don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in peace  
So we gotta fight some more  
  
And all those just trying to play their part  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those who own a human heart  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in what you want  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all those who got an axe to grind down  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those who got their burning lives  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there's no profit in ever being right  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all the people under broken homes  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there is profit in the land you own  
So we must fight some more  
  
And all those who got a tired face  
Don't wanna fight no more  
And all those who are lost without a trace  
Don't wanna fight no more  
But there is profit in the love of hate  
So we must fight some more
