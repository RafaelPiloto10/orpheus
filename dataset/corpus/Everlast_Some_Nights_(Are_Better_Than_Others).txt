Some nights are better than others  
Some fights are left among brothers  
Some nights are better than others  
Some fights are left among brothers  
  
You know the freaks come out at night with the drama  
I'm a break it down, take it down, learn it  
Roll it up, burn it, think it  
Stir it up, drink it, swallow it  
Follow it straight to the heart of the matter  
Program the data, turn on the lights  
Watch them all scatter, from the shine off the glean  
Course by my team, it's the high pro glow  
One for the show, two for the handgun  
Three, the one you man run when it's time for the action  
All the stories you told are bound to get old  
When your hands ain't as fast as the words you flippin'  
Word to Scott Pippin, got to be trippin'  
You must have been slippin', or want the ass whippin'  
It's time to start flippin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Some nights are better than others  
Break it down to the bare root essence  
Some fights are left among brothers  
Count your fingers then count your blessins  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
They say blood runs thicker than water  
Mothers to sons, bullets to guns  
Hard times are spreadin', just like the flu  
The voodoo child don't need to be raised  
I'm no kid, act wild son, you might get blazed  
Like an acid hit, I rock classic shit  
That can make your head bump, put some shake in your rump  
This ain't Forrest Gump but I got mad rhyme  
Why you shoot that gun, I'm a shoot this gift  
Leave you internally perplexed like the question if  
Some hit the spliff, some of y'all sniff  
Some clap the hammer when they pull a four fifth  
But most of y'all fry, kid let's be blunt  
You tryin' to be the man, well I be on the man hunt  
  
Chorus x4
