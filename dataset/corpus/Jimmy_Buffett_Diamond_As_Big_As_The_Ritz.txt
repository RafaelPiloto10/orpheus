Hidden in the mountains  
Under the earth and stone  
A cubic mile of perfection  
A treasure no one has known  
  
One man came upon this mother load  
Built himself a thousand room chateau  
  
He's the emperor of diamonds  
Master of the prize  
He's got a hold on happiness  
And all that money can buy  
  
Everyday he lives in fascination  
This is not an everyday temptation  
  
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this, tell me  
Who's gonna save you when your a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz  
  
A blessing can become a curse  
If you keep it to yourself  
Your own exaggeration  
Is not so good for your health  
  
It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream  
If you take one look behind the shine  
It doesn't always gleam  
  
Everyday he lives in fascination  
This is not an everyday temptation  
  
It way a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this  
Who's gonna save you when your a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz  
  
Coal under pressure  
Sparkle of treasure  
Crystalline measure  
Ornamental pleasure  
In the corner of your eye  
Make a grown man cry  
All the seeds you've sown  
  
Greed can crumble castle walls  
Greed can purchase you thrills  
Power is a dangerous thing  
It can maim it can kill  
  
It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream  
If you take one look behind the shine  
It doesn't always gleam  
  
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this  
Who's gonna save you when your a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz  
  
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz  
What you gonna do with this, tell me  
Who's gonna save you when you're a slave to  
The diamond as big as the Ritz
