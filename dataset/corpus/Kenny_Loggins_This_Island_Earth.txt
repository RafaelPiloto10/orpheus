When will we know love?  
When will we listen to heaven above?  
And how will we return?  
Someone said that we've been tempting fate  
But I believe this song just wouldn't come if it's too late.  
  
[Chorus]  
When will we see a light upon the ocean.  
Shining like a star  
That leads us ever onward  
There's a new world waiting  
When will we see rebirth  
This island Earth  
  
Maybe our moment is gone  
Maybe we've stood and watched  
A moment too long  
So why do I believe?  
Someone said  
That the truth's too much to take  
But tell me how we can face it  
If we only want to look the other way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To a new beginning  
Shine for all it's worth  
This Island Earth  
  
Why, what will we say to the angry child,  
Try to explain away her fears while we're crying burning tears  
Maybe it's time to cry the tear that matters  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh as we sail  
Through the stars  
We're alive on this island of ours
