Get outta my way  
I'm gettin' tired of you  
There ain't no chance  
Doin' what you wanna do  
I've been down down down down down  
Got to get my feet back on the ground  
  
Lady double dealer  
Get outta my way  
Lady double dealer  
You got nothing to say  
  
I ain't satisfied  
Dealin' with second hand goods  
You wanted somethin' for nothin'  
Taking everything you could  
You been 'round--I got the news  
But you ain't waitin' 'round for me to lose  
  
Lady double dealer  
Get outta my way  
Lady double dealer  
You got nothing to say  
I gave love to you  
Did what you wanted me to  
But all you did was bring me down  
So I just had to try  
Try to reason why  
You took advantage of my love  
  
Two timin' woman  
Tryin' to take me for a ride  
You're a hard lover honey  
But you sure don't keep me satisfied  
I wanna be there  
To try to make you see  
There ain't no woman gonna make a fool outta me
