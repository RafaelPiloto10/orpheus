As ashes slowly fall I turn to heed my inner call  
To feel the gap within my soul  
I must find the one inside the whole  
Flawless belief, is what my eyes see  
A shining figure here before me  
A divine idol we all plead to  
I'm down on my knees I worship you with owe  
I'm down on my knees my belief forever strong  
And I call out to you my lord of light  
Watch my faith how it glows  
God await that I know  
My praise for him I shall bestow...  
And sing it, praise you lord, he is the lord  
In all pas centuries I've lived  
False believers lived in eternal lie  
  
We live our life - amen  
Giving love to the end  
Shadows rise and fall  
At God's divine call  
The answer to my pleas  
Let all madness cease  
This will be done
