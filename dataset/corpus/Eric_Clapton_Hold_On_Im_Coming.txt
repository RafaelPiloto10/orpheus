Well, don't you ever be sad  
Lean on me when times are bad  
When the day comes and you're in doubt  
In a river of trouble, about to drown  
  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
  
I'm on my way, your lover  
When you get cold, yeah, I'll be your cover  
Don't have to worry because I'm here  
Don't need to suffer because I'm here  
  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
  
Reach out to me for satisfaction  
Call my name, quick reaction  
  
Well, don't you ever feel sad  
Lean on me when times are bad  
When the day comes and you're in doubt  
In a river of trouble and about to drown  
  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming  
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming
