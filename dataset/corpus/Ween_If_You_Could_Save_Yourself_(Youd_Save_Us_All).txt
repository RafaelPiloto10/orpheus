On a free ride home from the embassy  
I saw the governor, and his lover holding hands  
When I got to my place, I emptied my suitcase  
And opened the windows wide  
  
If you could save yourself, you'd save us all  
Is that what you called me for,  
Is that why you're knocking on my door?  
The time I've spent, working myself to death  
Thought that's what you wanted  
I thought you needed my help  
To make it good again, to make us strong  
To make you happy, to push you along  
And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb  
I was on my knees, when you knocked me down  
  
The wheels fell off, the bottom dropped out  
The checks all bounced, I came in your mouth  
Your mother came calling but there was no one around  
The trash caught fire when the leaves turned brown  
The vultures were circling when the circus left town  
I left you a note but I wrote it in disappearing ink  
  
If you could save yourself, you'd save us all  
Is that what you called me for,  
Is that why you're knocking on my door?  
The time I've spent, working myself to death  
Thought that's what you wanted  
I thought you needed my help  
To make it good again, to make us strong  
To make you happy, to push you along  
And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb  
I was on my knees, when you knocked me down
