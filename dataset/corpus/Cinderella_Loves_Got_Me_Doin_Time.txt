Have mercy on a poor boy's heart  
'Cause I got the key that can make your motor start  
Can't you love me  
Without messin' me around  
You took everything I got then kick me when I'm down  
Ooo, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level  
I look into those eyes but all I see's the devil  
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine  
Don't lock me up  
I can't pay the fine  
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine  
Your love's got me doin' time  
Have mercy on a poor boy's soul  
I've been down so long never thought I could feel so low  
First you love me  
Then you stab my back  
Close the door, turn the key, all I can see is black  
Ooo, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level  
I look into those eyes but all I see's the devil  
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine  
Don't lock me up  
I can't pay the fine  
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine  
Your love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
So what's a poor boy supposed to do  
I've done everything I can, I've been so true  
You got a mean streak  
Like an alley cat  
You sucked all the love from me like a vampire bat  
Ooo, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level  
I look into those eyes but all I see's the devil  
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine  
Don't lock me up  
I can't pay the fine  
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine  
Your love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time  
Love's got me doin'  
Love's got me doin' time
