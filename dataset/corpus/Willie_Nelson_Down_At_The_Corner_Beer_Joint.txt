Down at the corner beer joint, dancin' on the Rock 'n' Roll  
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul  
Down at the corner beer joint, dancin' on a hardwood floor  
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before  
Than they did before, than they did before  
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before  
  
Down at corner beer joint dancing to the Rock 'n' Roll  
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul  
Likes to move her soul, move her soul  
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul  
Sister comin' home, Momma gonna let her sleep the whole day long
