You think you love Sue  
But when I get thru with you  
You won't ever look at Sue again...  
  
I'm gonna be so good to you  
I'm gonna love you my whole life thru  
Pretty soon you'll feel the same  
You won't even know her name  
I'll give ya kisses that she can't beat  
I'll treat you so nice and sweet  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too  
  
I'm gonna treat you sweet and kind  
I'll drive her right outta your mind  
And you won't know her if you meet  
Walk right by her on the street  
Because I want you and need you so  
Poor Susie will have to go  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too  
  
I'm gonna be so good to you  
I'll love you my whole life thru  
Pretty soon you'll feel the same  
You won't even know her name  
I'll give you kisses that she can't beat  
I'll treat you so nice and sweet  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
You'll love me too, not Sue...
