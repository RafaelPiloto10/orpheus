I guess I've come to live here in your eyes.  
This must be the place called paradise.  
You are so precious to me,  
What a special time within our lives.  
And I guess I've come to live here in your eyes.  
  
A thousand times I see you  
And a thousand times you take my breath away.  
Fears and doubts consume me and I'm afraid someone will take it all away.  
I hope we're here forever, but I guess it's time that we both realized.  
That I guess I've come to live here in your eyes.
