You are the light  
That guides my way through fear  
I know my path will lead me to the King  
And all the world will bow to worship You  
You are the God  
Who changed the world through one Holy Son  
You gave everything  
So all the world will bow in awe of You  
You came down through grace  
To show a better way  
I follow the Son  
You're the only One  
Let Your kingdom come  
I'm giving it all to the One I love  
I follow the Son  
Jesus holy One  
Let Your will be done  
I give it all to You  
You are everything to me  
You are everything to me  
You are everything to me  
You are everything to me
