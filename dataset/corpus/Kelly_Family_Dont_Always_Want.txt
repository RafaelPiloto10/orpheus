Nowadays people want more, more and so do I  
My brother told me once  
You always wnat what you don't have  
But take a look at all the things you do have  
So the reason why I wrote this song  
Was to express what I think is wrong  
I'd like to be just a little bit taller  
I'd like to be just a little bit prettier  
I'd like to be just a little bit stronger  
But hey whatever  
Chorus:  
Don't always want what you don't have  
But be grateful for what you have  
Don't always want what you don't have  
But be grateful for what you have  
Well you can call me the consumator  
'Cause I never stop  
Feeding myself with all these obstacles untill I drop  
I want a house, a fat cat, my own sauna and a pool  
Have a yacht, my own piano and finally be cool  
I'm like that kid screaming to his mama "I want that toy"  
'Cause my filled room at home no longer gives me that joy  
And I don't recommend myself as someone to employ  
'Cause I want it all  
Chorus  
I want the world just to leave me alone  
Wanna move to New York and learn the saxophone  
I wanna jam with Miles Davis and John Coltran  
I've got so many wishes I think I'm going insane  
But what the hell am I supposed to do  
'Cause I'm trying real hard to undo all the emptiness inside me  
Which is why I want so much  
Chorus
