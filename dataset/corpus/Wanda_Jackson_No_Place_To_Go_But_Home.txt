They turned out the lights friends have said there goodnight  
Now there's no place to go but home  
I've had a beautiful evening for awhile I've forgot you were gone  
Now you're back on my mind how I hate closing time  
For there's no place to go but home  
No place to go but home and nobody home when I get there  
They turned out the lights friends have said their goodnight  
Now there's no place to go but home  
  
[ ac.guitar - steel ]  
  
I drive through this ghost of the city and I've never felt so alone  
It's the world's time to sleep and my time to weep  
For there's no place to go but home for there's no place to go but home
