featuring Ghostface, RZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard  
[RZA]  
Yo Yo Yo doodododododo Yo pssh yo  
Yo park the jeep on the street of the Sunset Marquis  
Autograph sign and pass wit a gold tip sharpee  
Permanent ink blots undrunk from velly poo scotts  
All you faggots try to judge my shit like Ed Koch  
Underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared  
Plea the ams radio tapes that he jammed  
Golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home  
Flip the track of the beat watch Bobby flip the metronome  
High voltage, keep my seat in winsbro cultured  
Kill enemies by mailin them the poison glue postage  
I open and fold ya thought he fucked a ogre  
I leave the cats the book of food stamps ????  
The box of evil a fifty sack of that lethal  
Adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from keebu  
  
[ODB] 4X  
What party can you go to  
And I ain't there you bitches actin like they don't care  
  
[RZA]  
You bitches actin like you don't care  
You bitches actin like you YO  
Razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks  
Golden platinum things unstainable  
I chew rocks  
Slipe wit type digital soup deflect bullets  
Black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded  
Land, like my cousin dusty dirty as dan  
Fucked the daughter of the leader of the Ku Klux Klan  
Tapes we dub pound you wit the ace of club  
Climb your tree to a shub  
Tongue kiss a lion and kidnap her cub  
Passin it portrait  
My bitch spread eagle wild orchid  
Pussy so wet you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick  
Tickle the tonsil you could hear her coughin  
I don't know if Dirt fucked Mariah, but I'm out to fuck Tyra  
Starks might fuck Mya  
  
[ODB]  
I'm the pussy vampire  
  
[Chorus] 4X  
[Ghostface]  
Yo I'm bent out three days two nights yo I'm spent out  
One hell of a cruise New York got they hand out  
Like I owe somethin, check they stance they frontin  
I'm two seconds fromt wistin ya'll shit over nuttin  
All a sudden ice grills kid you did a baby bid  
In a minute almost hung yourself slit ya wrists  
To the maximum hand me the forty I'll thrash and  
Split out guests wit gash lemon goes throw his laz gone  
Trama the block pro bar sledge slang ho  
Runnin from to and sharles some rap and I might blow  
World cup, some been blessed wit the Stanley  
Yvonne lendl ordered lamb racket wit the cam key  
Sideline maneuver, polish wax MC remover  
Niggaz wit long nails cuttin me leavin bruises  
Candle lows tied a thousand an ya'll froze  
Came home an dust that doo tryin to play me close  
We've been peaked for years now Liz wants to choppin the kid  
I might do magic make him disappear  
Rearose that nigga Isotoner Coca-Cola holder snap the granola  
Sprinkle ginko polish  
Venom from a cobra lace in the come he brought older  
Soaked through a strainer here's a doser  
The King James version is paid just like Samsung  
Wit effects that'll kill rogers double O seven  
Hanna Barbera hops the opposite abandoned the deer  
Fuck wit mics like Sonny and Cher  
Or maybe captain entenail, connect and then blow the seal  
Nice like mister whittendale your girl Chippendale  
Shallah bridge all up in ya dog dial trench  
When I snatched that shit was broke shoulda sent ya ass back  
And where's the key to the hatchback pop that  
Get in throw a bag full of mice and then respect that  
  
[Girl] 4X  
What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there  
These niggaz actin like they don't care  
What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there  
These hoes actin like they don't care
