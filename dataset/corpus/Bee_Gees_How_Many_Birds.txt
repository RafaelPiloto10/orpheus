I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm goin' crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through  
How many times must I tell you I love  
Tell you I love you times before  
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses  
I'm worth more then this , but you ignore  
  
How many birds will I see high and flying  
How many birds will it take till I get you  
I will be crying, yeah  
  
Maybe tomorrow you'll come walkin' my way  
Come talkin' my way , you'll find out  
My love for you will be stronger then truer  
I'll look at you and there's no doubt  
  
How many birds will I see high and flying  
How many birds will it take till I get you  
I will be crying, yeah  
  
I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through  
Baby, baby, baby  
My love, until the day we say auf wiedersehen
