I don't remember anymore  
I woke up freezin' on the floor  
My head was buzzin' like a saw  
I don't remember anymore  
  
She stole the bottle then she said  
Your eyes were blue and now they're red  
I think I'll carry you to bed  
I don't remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll, want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool  
I want my name in lights a la johnny b. goode  
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood  
  
Don't read the writing on the wall  
'cause if I'm having me a ball  
I stand around till I fall  
And don't remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll, want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool  
I want my name in lights a la johnny b. goode  
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood  
  
She stole the bottle then she said  
Your eyes were blue and now they're red  
I think I'll carry you to bed  
I don't remember anymore  
  
I want to rock and roll, want to sell my soul  
Sail the tv round the swimming pool  
I want my name in lights a la johnny b. goode  
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood  
  
Don't read the writing on the wall  
'cause if I'm having me a ball  
I stand around till I fall  
And don't remember anymore  
  
I don't remember anymore  
I don't remember anymore  
I don't remember anymore  
I don't remember anymore
