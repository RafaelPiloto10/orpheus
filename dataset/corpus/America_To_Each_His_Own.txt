To each his own it's plain to see  
To walk alone you have to be  
It's all for you and all for me, you'll see  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are, I'll love you still  
For my life is my conscience, the seeds I sow  
I just wanted to let you know  
  
Familiar faces that I've seen  
Turnin' red and turnin' green  
They just got caught with writing on their sleeve, I guess I'll leave  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are, I'll love you still  
Will you cancel my papers and lock the door  
Cause I ain't gonna be 'round no more  
  
Will I make it through the summer  
Breaking ties with the old and new  
Losing one just gains another  
There is nothing I can do  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are I'll love you still  
For my life is my conscience, the seeds I sow  
And I just wanted to let you know  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are, I'll love you still  
Will you cancel my papers and lock the door  
Cause I ain't gonna be 'round no more  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are I'll love you still  
For my life is my conscience, the seeds I sow  
And I just wanted to let you know  
  
I'm gonna miss you ..
