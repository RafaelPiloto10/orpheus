Foreign skies  
Blinded me to empty charms.  
I crossed the ocean,  
Fell into your arms  
  
So sure, so wrong..  
You sang me a simple tune,  
I took if for a song.  
  
Say goodbye  
Don't tell me why you have to go  
Loving you was as good as gone  
As good as gone.  
  
I'd love to know you  
Really know you  
But you see, there's something you should know,  
I never really thought you'd go  
  
Because today,  
I would have sworn I heard you say  
"I love you"  
"I want you"  
"I need to be with you today"  
I saw something in your face  
  
Stay here beside me,  
I need your love to guide me  
Your love,  
But now it's gone away,  
You left me crying like a baby,  
Like a baby
