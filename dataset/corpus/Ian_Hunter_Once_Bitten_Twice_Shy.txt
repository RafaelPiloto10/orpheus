(Ian hunter)  
  
Well the times gettin' hard for you little girl  
I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over god's world  
You don't remember when you got your last meal  
And you forgot just how a woman feels  
You didn't know what rock n' roll was  
Until you met a drummer on a greyhound bus  
I got there in the nick of time  
Before he got his hands across your state line  
  
Well in the middle of the night  
On the open road  
And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold  
You're gettin' tired baby, you're lookin' kinda beat  
The music of the street, drive you off your feet  
You didn't know how rock n' roll looked  
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group  
Half-way home in the parking lot  
By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep  
All the blood on my hand and my les paul heat  
I can't leave you home cos you're runnin' around  
My best friend told me you're the best trick in town  
  
You didn't know that rock n' roll burned  
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned  
You got the rhythm, you got the speed  
Mamma's little baby likes it short and sweet  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
I didn't know ya got a rock n' roll record  
Until a saw your picture on another guy's jacket  
You told me I was the only one  
And look at you now, well it's dark as it's dumb  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe
