Once in a life there comes a man like you  
And you bear a son so much like yourself  
And it's hard to believe that he's a grown man  
But pop I understand  
  
Once every night I thank my lucky stars  
You've given me some guiding light  
But there comes a time when a father and a son  
Can no longer be as one  
  
It took me so long to recover  
From the pain of having denied the love I once relied upon  
It takes more than time to discover  
That for both the young and old  
The truth is sometimes cold but right  
  
This is my life  
And I've got to hold my own  
Even if it means hurting us both  
And the wrongs become right when  
We stop and wonder how  
Look at us  
We're better friends now
