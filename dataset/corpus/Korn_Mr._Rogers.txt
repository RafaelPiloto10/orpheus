Time has come to realize  
What you are, what you've done inside  
Time has come, we'll have something to talk about  
  
I will too  
Looking back (dumb)  
Oh now I realize (old man)  
How much you really liked him (dumb)  
This child's mind you terrorized (old man)  
You came to him (dumb)  
He really didn't know your lies (old man)  
Now his innocence gone (dumb)  
He's that child you terrorized (old man)  
  
This fucking pain that I feel (it came to me from you)  
This fucking pain that I feel (because of you)  
My childhood is gone (because I loved you)  
My childhood is gone (because I loved you)  
  
Be my neighbor  
Looking back (child)  
Oh now I now realize (fucker)  
How much you really loved him (child)  
This child's mind you hypnotized (fucker)  
You came to him (child)  
You really didn't know his lies (fucker)  
Now his innocence gone (child)  
I'm that child you terrorized (fucker)  
This fucking hatred I feel (it came to me from you)  
This fucking pain that I feel (because of you)  
  
My childhood is gone (because I loved you)  
My childhood is gone (because I loved you)  
Be my neighbor  
Be my neighbor  
My neighbor  
  
Fred, you told me everybody was my neighbor  
They took advantage of me, you let them take their turns hitting me  
I wish I would have never watched you  
You really made my childhood a failure  
What a fucking neighbor
