He can turn the tides  
And calm an angry sea  
He alone decides  
Who writes a symphony  
  
He lights ev'ry star  
That makes our darkness bright  
He keeps watch all through  
The dark and lonely night  
  
He still finds the time  
To hear a child's small prayer  
Saint or sinners call  
They always find Him there  
  
Though it makes him sad  
To see the way we live  
He'll always say  
"I forgive"
