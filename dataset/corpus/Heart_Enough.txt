The color blue  
I always felt it like a sigh  
But this is new  
This blue fire inside his eyes  
With feet of snow  
I try in vain  
He makes the northern lights come dance for me again  
  
(chorus)  
He's good enough  
He's sweet enough  
He's man enough a little touch  
I need so much  
I want so much  
I need to feel that secret touch  
Why can't I break out  
Why won't he reach out for me  
Oh Loneliness  
It comes and it goes  
But lately loneliness loneliness  
It just grows and grows and grows  
Cause here he is living deep inside  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere to hide  
  
(chorus)
