[Verse 1]  
There is a secret, I found a secret  
Behind a SoHo door  
There is a reason, I found a reason  
Beneath the subway floor  
I found the water, the devil's water  
And walked along its shore  
  
[Break-Down 1]  
Is that what you want?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Your channel's changing, the heart is racing  
From voices on the wire  
The soul is yearning, the coal is burning  
The ember starts a fire  
Can we recover love for each other?  
The measure of your life  
  
[Break-Down 2]  
Is that what you want?  
Is that what you really want?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
A river, a river  
A river running underground  
A river, a river  
Is that what you want?  
Is that what you really want?  
  
[Chorus] x2  
I, I, I am a river  
I, I, I am your river  
  
[Break-Down 2]  
  
[Chorus] x2  
  
[Bridge]  
I am a river  
  
[Chorus] x3
