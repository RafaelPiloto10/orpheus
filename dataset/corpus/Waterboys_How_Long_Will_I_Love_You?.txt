How long will I love you  
As long as there are stars above you  
And longer if I can  
  
How long will I need you  
As long as the seasons need to  
Follow their plan  
  
How long will I be with you  
AS long as the sea is bound to  
wash upon the sand  
  
How long will I want you  
As long as you want me to  
And longer by far  
  
How long will I hold you  
As long as your father told you  
As long as you are  
  
How long will I give to you  
As long as I live to you  
However long it you say  
  
How long will I love you  
As long as are stars above you  
And longer if I may
