Woman, she's moving to the weight of the world  
Momma, she's carrying the weight of the world  
All the time she breathing in the weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Bring it on home  
Bring the soup on home  
  
Well, poppa, too, he got the weight of the world  
Man is moving in to the weight of the world  
And all the time, along with the soup he's bringing home  
The weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Children, too, fall to this weight of the world  
All the time they they fall, right there into the weight  
And all the time they're trying to shake  
The weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody's going to the wake of the world  
We're all dressing up fine for the wake of the world  
And everybody's hiding behind trees, breathing loud  
The weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]
