Me and my goose  
Me and my pal  
We had some very good times  
Me and my goose his name was Al  
And he cost only a dime  
  
Over meadows we'd stray  
Playing all day  
I missed him at night until dawn  
Then one day I found he wasn't around  
I wondered where Al could have gone  
  
I looked everywhere he just wasn't there  
Where could a goose be all day  
I miss my pal  
I miss my Al  
It's sad that things turned out this way  
  
Then mom brought him  
I remember her grin  
Stuffed with his feet pointed straight  
  
I'll never forget the night that we ate  
Al off of the old yellow plate
