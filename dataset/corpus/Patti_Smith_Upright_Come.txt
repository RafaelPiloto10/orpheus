Hail brother  
The distant thunder  
Is nothing but hearts  
Beating as one  
Dance of a million  
On God's pavilion  
Come come  
Beat on your drum  
  
Awake people arise  
Awake upright come  
Fortune is falling like  
Tears from the skies  
Open your eyes  
  
Hail sister  
Come on over  
To shape reshape  
Things to come  
Bow your head  
Raise your lantern  
Come come  
Beat on your drum  
  
Awake people arise  
Awake upright come  
Fortune is falling like  
Tears from the skies  
Open your eyes  
  
United action is what we need  
Time to say that everything is going to be  
Wasted icons wasted lives  
Like war obsolete  
  
Awake people arise  
Awake upright come  
Fortune is falling like  
Tears from the skies  
Open your eyes  
  
These are the times  
The times of our own  
These are the shapes  
The world we formed  
Swift is the arrow  
Dark is the thorn  
The slate is clean  
The future awaits  
Awake
