Wake up in the middle of the night  
And the air is so heavy  
And my head's screwed on too tight  
In the glow of the Christmas lights  
I watch you sleep  
  
And the hands on the cigarette clock are just  
Time ticking away this love I got  
There's no way to make it stop before you wake  
  
Well I know you're leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know you're leaving me  
I'm running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
  
We go down to Prospect Park  
To watch the light become the dark  
And I don't think I've ever been this scared  
Outside as the double moon rises  
I know this time it won't surprise us  
But that don't mean that I will be prepared  
  
I know you're leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know you're leaving me  
I'm running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
  
So tired of writing sad songs  
But my mind's on misery  
I know there's time until you're gone  
I can't let it be  
No I can't let it be  
  
I know you're leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know you're leaving me  
I'm running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Just who I'm supposed to be  
Oh
