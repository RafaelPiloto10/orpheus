You're a polished diamond  
Now you're feeling kinda rough  
Yes I know how long you've been searching  
For the perfect touch  
You better hear what I say  
I can tell your eyes are just about to  
give you away  
  
Cause there's the girl that you were after  
Feel your heart beating faster now  
There's the girl you were after  
Can you say that you don't want her anymore  
  
Just take my word now  
Cause you know it's true  
she ain't good enough  
for the likes of you  
You better hear what I say  
I can tell your eyes are just about to  
give you away  
  
Cause there's the girl you were after  
Feel your heart beating faster now  
There's the girl that you were after  
And all this time you can't get past her  
There's the girl you were after  
Broken glass, complete disaster  
There's the girl you were after  
Can you say that you don't want her anymore  
  
I believed you once  
When you explained  
That it wasn't so tough  
To forget her name  
  
Cause there's the girl that you were after  
Feel your heart beating faster now  
There's the girl that you were after  
And all the time you can't get past her  
There's the girl that you were after  
Broken glass complete disaster  
There's the girl that you were after  
Can you say that you don't want her anymore  
  
There's the girl  
There's the girl  
There's the girl  
There's the girl (can you say that you don't want her anymore)
