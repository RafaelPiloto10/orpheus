It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done  
To be so in love with you and so alone  
Follow me where I go  
What I do and who I know  
  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down  
All the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
It's long been on my mind  
You know it's been a long long time  
I've tried to find a way that I could make you understand  
The way I feel about you  
  
And just how much I need you  
To be there when I can talk to you  
When there's no one else around  
Follow me where I go  
  
What I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down  
All the way and all around  
  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
You see, I'd like to share my life with you  
And show you things I've seen  
Places that I'm going to  
  
And places where I've been  
To have you there beside me, we'll never be alone  
And all the time that you're with me  
Then we will be at home  
  
Follow me where I go  
What I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down  
  
All the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me
