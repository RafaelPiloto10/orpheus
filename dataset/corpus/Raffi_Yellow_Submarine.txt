In the town where I was born  
Lived a man, who sailed the sea  
And he told us of his life  
In the land of submarines  
So we sailed off to the sun  
Till we found a sea of green  
And we lived beneath the waves  
In our yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
And our friends are all aboard  
Many more of them live next door  
And the band begins to play  
Oh, we all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
As we live a life of ease  
Everyone of us has all we need  
Sky of blue, a sea of green  
In our yellow submarine  
Oh, we all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
