If there's doubt and you're cold,  
Don't you worry what the future holds.  
We've gotta have heroes to teach us all  
To never give up on a dream.  
  
Claim the road, touch the sun,  
No force on earth could stop you run.  
When your heart bursts like the sun  
Never never give up on a dream.  
  
Shadows fall, daylight dies,  
Freedom never got a place to hide.  
Search forever photo finish line  
But never give up on your dream.  
  
Crazy notions fill your head,  
You gotta break all the records set.  
Push yourself until the end  
But don't you ever give up on your dream.  
  
Now listen to me  
You don't need no restrictions yeah  
Oh, sing it again  
You can't live on sympathy.  
You just need to go the distance,  
Oh the distance  
That's all you need to be free,  
To be free, to be free, to be free.  
  
Sing a song for me children  
You don't need no restrictions yeah  
You can't live on sympathy.  
You just need to go the distance,  
That's all you need to be free,  
  
Now listen to me!  
Inspiring all to never lose,  
It'll take a long long time before they fill your shoes  
It'll take somebody, somebody, who's lot like you  
Who never gave up on a dream.  
No, you never gave up on a dream  
No, you never gave up on a dream.  
  
You never, never, never,  
Never gave up on a dream.
