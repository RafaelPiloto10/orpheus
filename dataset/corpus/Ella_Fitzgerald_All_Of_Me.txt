All of me, why not take all of me?  
Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?  
Take my lips, I'll never use them  
Take my arms, I want to lose them  
  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me?  
  
All of me, why not take all of me?  
Can't you see I'm no good without you?  
Take my lips, I want to lose 'em  
Take my arms, I'll never use them  
  
Your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on, dear, without you?  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me?  
  
Come on and take, take all of me
