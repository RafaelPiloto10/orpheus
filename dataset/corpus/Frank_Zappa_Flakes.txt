Flakes! flakes!  
Flakes! flakes!  
They don't do no good  
They never be workin'  
When they oughta should  
They waste your time  
They're wastin' mine  
California's got the most of them  
Boy, they got a host of them  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
They got the flakes  
Flakes! flakes!  
They can't fix yer brakes  
You ask 'em, "where's my motor? "  
"well, it was eaten by snakes..."  
You can stab 'n' shoot 'n' spit  
But they won't be fixin' it  
They're lyin' an' lazy  
They can be drivin' you crazy  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Swear t'god they got the most  
At every business on the coast  
Take it away, bob...  
I asked as nice as I could  
If my job would  
Somehow be finished by Friday  
Well, them whole damn weekend  
Came 'n' went, frankie  
Wanna buy some mandies, bob?  
'n' they didn't do nothin'  
But they charged me double for Sunday  
You know, no matter what you do,  
They gonna cheat 'n' rob you  
Then they'll send you a bill  
That'll get your senses reelin'  
And if you do not pay  
They got computer collectors  
That'll get you so crazy  
'til your head'll go through th' ceilin'  
Yes it will!  
I'm a moron, 'n' this is my wife  
She's frosting a cake  
With a paper knife  
All what we got here's  
American made  
It's a little bit cheesey,  
But it's nicely displayed  
Well we don't get excited when it  
Crumbles 'n' breaks  
We just get on the phone  
And call up some flakes  
They rush on over  
'n' wreck it some more  
'n' we are so dumb  
They're linin' up at our door  
Well, the toilet went crazy  
Yersterday afternoon  
The plumber he says  
Never flush a tampoon!  
This great information  
Cost me half a week's pay  
And the toilet blew up  
Later on the next day-ay-eee-ay  
Blew up the next day  
Woo-ooo  
We are millions 'n' millions,  
We're coming to get you  
We're protected by unions  
So don't let it upset you  
Can't escape the conclusion  
It's probably god's will  
That civilization  
Will grind to a standstill  
And we are the people  
Who will make it all happen  
While yer children is sleepin',  
Yer puppy is crappin'  
You might call us flakes  
Or something else you might coin us  
But we know you're so greedy  
That you'll probably join us  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you  
We're coming to get you, we're coming to get you...
