Could this be true  
Could this be me  
The one who kept himself so high and free  
Caught up in the highest game of all  
And all my defences tumble and fall  
Only the ace of hearts can save now  
  
I wake in early hours and call your name  
It's your face I see pressed up against my window pane  
And suddenly I realize  
As the tears start to fall like rain from the sky  
Only the ace of hearts can save me now  
Said only the ace of hearts can save me now  
  
Ace of hearts tell me what's this game we're playing  
Ace of hearts it's all down to you  
I'm lost, lost like a child in a strange dream  
Open your doors and pull me  
Pull me trough  
  
And I'm flying like the wind in the dead of night  
Flying so high searching for those landing lights  
I've never been this high before  
But darling all I need is your love more and more  
And only the ace of hearts can save me now
