I'm the kinda guy who can't stand the holiday  
So I drink em all away, that's me  
I don't decorate no trees  
And I won't eat no potato laces  
But I'll give this old lady's melons a squeeze  
That's just who I am  
  
Well I'll never spin a dreidle  
But I'll always throw an egg  
And I'll charlie horse your leg for laughs  
While you're singin' your holiday tune  
I'm actin' like a town buffoon  
With an out my big white scary moon  
And blowin' out beef your way  
  
I hate folks who think reindeer are cute  
To me, they're just somethin' to shoot  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me  
  
Well I'm a snowmobile stealin', no tears the season feelin' kind of guy  
This time of year sucks  
So I take my nun-chucks  
And make sure every snowman dies  
  
Believing in Santa's all wrong  
And Hanukkah's eight nights too long  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me  
  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me
