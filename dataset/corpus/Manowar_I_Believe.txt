From the darkness I walk into the light,  
From the day I walk into the night,  
From the shadows I will appear,  
With a message for all who will hear.  
  
For the weaker part I will be strong,  
To the defenders of faith I will be long,  
To the last of us fight till we die,  
To the keys of the kingdom of night.  
  
All stand together for the worlds to see,  
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams,  
Say the words forever your strength will never leave  
If you want to win the fight say I believe.
