There was a man on the road bout an hour ago  
and he was looking for a ride to New Mexico  
Well we was driving by  
Way too fast to know  
Well then we got to the place on a high speed chase  
There was a girlie in the corner with a plastic face  
And then she disappeared without a trace  
I say without a trace  
Well now we're kicking back and we're sipping beers  
And there's a man telling stories about his inner fears  
We was all choked up and too close to tears  
Well then we moved on up to some margaritas  
And we started making faces at the senoritas  
Playing drinking games, but they were all too drunk to beat us  
Well now, my car broke down about an hour ago  
We were heading on down to New Mexico,  
But, well we did not see the gas was low  
[Chorus]  
Hey, hey, I said the gas was low  
the gas was low  
the gas was low  
the gas was low  
Hey, the gas was low. Hey.  
Lalalalalalalalaaaaaaaaa  
We got back to the party  
We been on the road we're kinda dirty  
I seen this girl I said you're mighty purty.  
Well I said hello, bout an hour ago  
We were heading on down to the big grass show,  
But hey, we did not see, the gas was low  
[Chorus]  
About an hour, about an hour ago  
About an hour, about an hour ago  
About an hour... about - an hour ago.
