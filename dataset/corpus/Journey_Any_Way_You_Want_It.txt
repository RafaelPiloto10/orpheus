Any way you want it  
That's the way you need it  
Any way you want it  
  
She loves to laugh  
She loves to sing  
She does everything  
She loves to move  
She loves to groove  
She loves the lovin' things  
  
Ooh, all night, all night  
Oh, every night  
So hold tight, hold tight  
Ooh baby, hold tight  
  
Oh,she said,  
"Any way you want it  
That's the way you need it  
Any way you want it"  
She said, "Any way you want it  
That's the way you need it  
Any way you want it"  
  
I was alone  
I never knew  
What good love could do  
Ooh, then we touched  
Then we sang  
About the lovin' things  
  
Ooh, all night, all night  
Oh, every night  
So hold tight, hold tight  
Ooh baby, hold tight  
  
Oh, she said,  
"Any way you want it  
That's the way you need it  
Any way you want it"  
She said, "Any way you want it  
That's the way you need it  
Any way you want it"
