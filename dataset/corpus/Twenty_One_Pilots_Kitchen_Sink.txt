[Verse 1]  
Nobody thinks what I think  
Nobody dreams when they blink  
Think things on the brink of blasphemy I'm my own shrink  
Think things are after me I'm my catastrophe  
I'm a kitchen sink  
You don't know what that means  
Because a kitchen sink to you  
Is not a kitchen sink to me,  
Okay, friend  
  
[Verse 2]  
Are you searching for purpose  
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless  
Then paint something then, it might be wordless  
Pointless curses, nonsense verses  
You'll see purpose start to surface  
No one else is dealing with your demons  
Meaning may be defeating them  
Could be the beginning of your meaning, friend  
  
[Chorus]  
Go away (x4)  
Leave me alone (x7)  
  
[Verse 3]  
Nobody thinks what you think, no one  
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction  
They will play a game and say they know what you're going through  
And then try to come up with a narcistic way to say  
They don't know you  
And neither do I, so  
Here's a prime example of a standup guy, who  
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time  
Here's my brother and his head, screwed up, but that's alright  
  
[Verse 4]  
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em  
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after  
A re-beginning moments mending memories  
Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me  
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man  
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me  
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle  
Better I am, Gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?  
  
[Chorus]  
Go away (x4)  
Leave me alone (x5)  
  
Don't leave me alone
