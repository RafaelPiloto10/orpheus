The land of race car ya-yas  
The land where you can't change lanes  
The land where large fuzzy dice still hang proudly  
Like testicles from rear view mirrors  
The land of race car ya-yas  
The land where you can't change lanes  
The land where large fuzzy dice still hang proudly  
Like testicles from rear view mirrors  
The land of race car ya-yas, ya-yas  
Oh no, the land of race car ya-yas  
The land of race car ya-yas  
Race car ya-yas
