[Chorus]  
You see right through me.  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
  
You let me win,  
You let me ride  
You let me rock  
You let me slide  
And when they lookin'  
You let me hide.  
Defend my honor  
Protect my pride.  
The good advice  
I always hated  
But looking back  
It made me greater.  
You always told me  
Forget the haters  
Just get my money,  
Just get my weight up.  
Know when I'm lying,  
Know when I'm crying  
It's like you got it  
Down to a science  
Why am I trying  
No you ain't buying,  
I tried to fight it  
Back with defiance.  
You make me laugh  
You make me hoarse  
From yelling at you  
And getting at you  
Picking up dishes  
Throwing them at you.  
Why are you speaking  
When no one asked you.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What are we doing,  
Could you see through me?  
Cause you say Nicki  
And I say who me?  
And you say no you  
And I say screw you.  
Then you start dressing  
And you start leaving  
And I start crying  
And I start screaming  
The heavy breathing  
But whats the reason.  
Always get the reaction you wanted  
I'm actually fronting  
I'm askin' you something  
Yo, answer this question,  
Class is in session,  
Tired of letting  
Passive aggression  
Control my mind,  
Capture my soul  
OK your right  
Just let it go.  
OK you got it,  
Its in the can.  
Before I played it  
You knew my hand.  
You could turn a free throw into a goal.  
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Stop,  
Stop,  
Would you just stop looking through me  
Cause I just cant take it.  
No I cant take it.  
  
You see right through me.  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
  
You see right through me.  
(you see right through me baby)  
You see right through me  
You see right through me
