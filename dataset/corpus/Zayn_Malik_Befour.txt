[Intro]  
I've done this before  
Not like this  
  
[Verse 1]  
I don't drink to get drunk  
I feel all the right funk  
If there's something I want  
I'll take all the right wrongs  
Now, I'm gonna stay in my zone  
I'm tired of picking that bone  
And I can't be bothered to fight it no more, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Numb on a roof  
Set it on fire  
Just to give me proof  
I'm living on a wire  
Numb on a roof  
Set it on fire  
Just to give me proof  
I'm living on a wire  
  
[Chorus]  
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now  
So say what you wanna say, what you want  
Shame is you won't say that to my face  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I've done this before  
Not like this, not like this  
  
[Verse 2]  
Time for me to move up  
So many hours have gone  
Heart beats the pump of my blood  
No strings for you to pull on  
You've got your tongue in your cheek  
So pardon if I don't speak  
Can't tune my chords into your songs, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Numb on a roof  
Set it on fire  
Just to give me proof  
I'm living on a wire  
  
[Chorus]  
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now  
So say what you wanna say  
So say what you wanna say, what you want  
Shame is you won't say that to my face  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I've done this before  
Not like this, not like this  
  
[Chorus]  
Flashing lights  
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now  
So say what you wanna say, what you want  
Shame is you won't say that to my face  
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna  
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now  
So say what you wanna say, what you want  
Shame is you won't say that to my face  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I've done this before  
Not like this, not like this  
I've done this before  
Not like this, not like this
