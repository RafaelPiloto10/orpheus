They're gonna put me in the movies they're gonna make a big star out of me  
They'll make a film about a girl who's sad and lonely and all I gotta do is
act naturally  
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star might win an Oscar you can never
tell  
The movies are gonna make me a big star cause I can play the part so well  
I hope you'll come to see me in the movies then I know that you will plainly
see  
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time and all I gotta do is act
naturally  
  
We'll make a scene about a girl that's sad and lonely  
And begging down upon her bended knee  
I'll play the part that I won't need rehearsing all I gotta do is act
naturally  
Well I'll bet you  
And all I gotta do is act naturally and all I gotta do is act naturally
