Come On Let's Drink It Up  
And We Don't Go All Night  
And We Ain't Stop Untill The Sunlight Touch The Ground  
The Music Is Getting Loud I Can't Believe It Right  
We Jumpin Jumpin Like It's Going Not To Stop  
  
Chorus:  
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down  
Down Down Down Down  
Down Down Down Down  
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down  
Down Down Down Down  
Down Down Down Down  
  
First Cal For Shot  
Won't Be No Last  
My Hands Got Lost I Found Em On Her Ass  
She Kissing Her And Her Touching Me  
Must Be The Base This Beat Is Breaking Glass  
Moving More Baby Pour All Your Love On Me  
Dj Go Don't Stop It No  
She Taking Up The Club  
  
Come On Let's Drink It Up  
And We Don't Go All Night  
And We Ain't Stop Untill The Sunlight Touch The Ground  
The Music Is Getting Loud I Can't Believe It Right  
We Jumpin Jumpin Like It's Going Not To Stop  
  
Chorus:  
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down  
Down Down Down Down  
Down Down Down Down  
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down  
Down Down Down Down  
Down Down Down Down  
  
Let's Go Too Far  
No Turning Back  
With Some Crazy Shit  
Live Tonight Like It's Our Last  
Give Up Control  
No Need For That  
Yes A Stranger  
Tomorrow Will Be No Regrets...  
Moving More Baby Pour All Your Love On Me  
Dj Go Don't Stop It No  
She Taking Up The Club
