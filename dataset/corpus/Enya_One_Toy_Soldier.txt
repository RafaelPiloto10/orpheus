One toy soldier stands alone  
With his drum down by his side  
  
One toy soldier on his own  
With his drum to keep the time  
  
He keeps the beet of marching feet  
He keeps the beat so true  
He's one small toy for one small boy  
But his heart is oh so blue  
  
Who can mend my broken drum  
Will it be as good as new  
  
I must play when morning comes  
I don't, what shall I do?  
  
He keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat inside  
While children sleep, he dreams so deep  
There's a secret he must hide  
  
For he keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat so true  
He wants to sing and hopes to bring  
Happy Christmas day to you  
  
He keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat inside  
Someone has come to mend his drum  
Now his heart lights up with pride  
  
So he keeps the beat of marching feet  
He keeps the beat so true  
When morning comes, he plays his drum  
  
Happy Christmas Day to you! [Repeat: x4]
