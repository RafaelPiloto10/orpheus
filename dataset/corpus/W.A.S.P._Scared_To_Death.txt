Grit your teeth and listen for the gun  
Get in the runners block and kneel  
And run the human race  
That decadent decathlon and  
Let the games begin for real  
Stop scaring me, it's bedlam in paradise  
Stop I can't see, nowhere I can hide  
Scared to run, this monstrous  
Marathon of fear  
  
I run the races with a dark horse to win  
Across a finish line of fear  
I swim a sea of skin, afraid to drown in flesh  
X-generations revolutions here  
Scared to have sex, I don't want to die  
Scared I'll be next, I'm scared for my life  
Dying to live, but there ain't no way  
Outta here alive, all we're all scared there's  
  
Nowhere to run, I'm scared to death  
Nowhere to hide, scared I'll be next  
Oh- stop, stop, stop, stop  
Nowhere to run, I'm scared to death  
Nowhere to hide, scared I'll be next  
Oh- stop, stop, stop, stop  
  
Am I a prisoner of the universe?  
Is destiny fixed among the stars?  
Should I cry or laugh?  
All I know is that  
The best time to laugh  
Is any time you can  
Life's one big party, thrown here by God  
We all get invitations, if we want them or not  
It's all truth or dare and nothing is fair, no  
No no  
We're all scared there's  
  
Oh, it's the decade of fear  
No way out of here, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Oh scream in my ears  
Oh stop what I hear, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
