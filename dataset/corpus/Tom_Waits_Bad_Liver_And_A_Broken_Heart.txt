Well I got a bad liver and broken heart, yeah,  
I drunk me a river since you tore me apart  
And I don't have a drinking problem, 'cept when I can't get a drink  
And I wish you'd a-known her, we were quite a pair,  
She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer  
So welcome to the continuing saga, she was my better half, and I was just a
dog  
And so here am I slumped, I've been chipped and I've been chumped on my stool  
So buy this fool some spirits and libations, it's these railroad station bars  
And all these conductors and porters, and I'm all out of quarters  
And this epitaph is the aftermath, yeah I choose my path, hey, come on, Kath,  
He's a lawyer, he ain't the one for ya  
No, the moon ain't romantic, it's intimidating as hell,  
And some guy's trying to sell me a watch  
And so I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch  
I got me a bottle and a dream, it's so maudlin it seems,  
You can name your poison, go on ahead and make some noise  
I ain't sentimental, this ain't a purchase, it's a rental, and it's purgatory,  
And hey, what's your story, well I don't even care  
Cause I got my own double-cross to bear  
  
And I'll see your Red Label, and I'll raise you one more,  
And you can pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more,  
Cause it don't douse the flames that are started by dames,  
It ain't like asbestos  
It don't do nothing but rest us assured,  
And substantiate the rumors that you've heard
