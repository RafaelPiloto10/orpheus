What are you gonna do, when they tell you what to do?  
Taught at a young age, to respect the men in blue  
And due their fucking state control, your forced to go into their schools  
Where they teach us twisted history and make us pledge allegiance to their
flag  
It's time that the next generation learned to think for them-fucking-selves  
  
What are you gonna do  
When they tell you what to do? [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Taught at a young age, what was wrong and what was right  
And as they impose their rules of suspension they hope we won't put up a fight  
Well they teach us twisted history and make us pledge allegiance to their flag  
You don't need a paper to say you're smart if you can think for yourself  
  
What are you gonna do  
When they tell you what to do [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Don't let them tell to you what to do  
The teachers in your class or the bullies in your school  
Don't let them tell you how to think  
Your parents or some fucking shrink  
Don't let the, tell you how to act  
Wait till they see that you're dropping out of class  
Don't let the school district tell you what to do  
Tell everybody... Fuck you
