Forbidden Jimmy  
Has got a mighty sore tooth  
From biting too many dimes  
In a telephone booth  
He's got half of his boot lace  
Tied to the dial  
Well thank you operator  
For getting Jimmy to smile  
"Call out the coast guard"  
Screamed the police  
Forbidden Jimmy  
He's got three water skis  
He put two on his wavelength  
And gave one to his girl  
She's a mighty fine person  
It's a mighty fine world  
I'm gonna make all your sorrows bright  
Set your soul free  
I'll see you tomorrow night  
If I can still see  
Ginger Caputo  
And Dorian Gray  
Oughta stay out of pictures  
If they got nothin' to say  
Stack 'em back on the rack Jack  
Ya know, you're hurting my eye  
Forbidden Jimmy  
He's getting ready to fly  
Gonna make all your sorrows bright  
Set your soul free  
I'll see you tomorrow night  
If I can still see  
I got caught cooking popcorn  
And calling it hail  
They wanna stick my head  
Inside a water pail  
Ya know, they're gonna be sorry  
They're gonna pay for it too  
Forbidden jimmy  
He's coming straight at you
