The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
The things that you say to me  
The look on your face  
Brings out the man in me  
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
Could I be dreamin'  
Is this really real  
'Cause there's something magic  
The way that I feel in your arms tonight  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
Keep fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, keep fallin', mm, fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, I'm
fallin'  
Yes, I'm fallin' (Yes, I'm fallin' Yes, I'm fallin')  
Yes, I'm fallin' (Yes, I'm fallin' Yes, I'm fallin')  
Yes, we're fallin' (Yes, we're fallin' Yes, we're fallin')  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall
