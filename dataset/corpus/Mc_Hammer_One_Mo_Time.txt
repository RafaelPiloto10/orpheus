One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
I'm goin' fo' mine, one mo' time  
I'm gettin' my goals accomplished while the others sit back and wind  
And none of y'all can fade me so don't even try  
'Cause I'm the best at what I do and I'm a tell you why  
So you see I'm too legit too ever quit  
I started gaining momentum when they put me in the mix  
You'll feel my power, the stage I'll burn it up  
So put it on the hammer, then people will burn it up  
To the records who tried to diss this is on yo face  
I'll turn this mutha out leave you lookin' disgraced  
Bet you can't touch and now you regret fo' calling  
Yourself a pet instead of something wet  
Now brothers went long, it's still the same song  
While people rollin' on, your crew is gone  
You know I got it started with a kickin' gold rhyme  
Suck as betta' pray 'cause it's hammer time one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
Check I peepin' over there if the fellows give me ten minutes  
I'll bet you I'll be in em' 'cause growin' on the high street  
Taught me how to get em', I grew on em'  
So tight I'm known to hight em' and quit em'  
See I step to her, she's mine in a matter of minutes  
It ain't how long you talk it's what you put in em'  
Spittin' this game so cold and you tellin' me  
That I'm not able to pick up this freak, well, you fail to see  
The hard nigga is what they call me  
And every year I'm at the player's balgee  
Whenever I'm next you can prepare to see a show  
And whenever it comes to breakin' it up  
You know I'm lettin' em' win the net  
And I'm the man in command, so I'm puttin' em' in their place  
And if she's lookin' for handouts then get outta' Hammer's Face  
I'm not the type to wine and dine but I'm freak to blow your mind  
So I guess I'm goin' fo' mine, one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
Hold now, take me to the bay  
I'm gainin' momentum from the 90's to the bay  
And everywhere I went, I made the people say  
Hey, I'm makin' em' all amazed in every phase  
And rap fools I gotta serve em' but this time  
The Hammer gotta hurt em'  
State to state after partyin' in Casinos  
Doin' and tryin' that, lougin' in Reno  
I got it started in Bang cock and rocked Barbados  
And watched Holy field know em' out in Vegas city  
After city I left the people in shock, you betta have believed  
I left the whole place rock and I love the way that the money  
Just rolls out, fifteen hundred cities every one of em' sold out  
Private jets, good times and bad times, suckas be tryin' to diss  
So I'm comin' with mad rhymes  
All of these things often come to mind  
But guess what y'all? Here comes the payback to her  
I'm doin' it one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time  
I'm givin' it to 'em one mo' time, hey
