Daniella,  
Don't say be tender first  
And don't say teach me  
Before you get tied up for your first time  
I'm not like that  
I'm not so good you will want to  
Run away for us  
your black hair is like black hair  
Mine I promise is a jerk's hair  
Your acne is like a pearl  
Mine I swear is a brimstone  
I'm not like that  
How is it you thought I might be?  
I'm not like that  
I'm not like that  
All I'll recall of you:  
A sturdy tongue like a blistered toe
