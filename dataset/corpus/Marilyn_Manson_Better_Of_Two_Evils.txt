Haters call me bitch  
Call me fagot call me whitey  
But I am something that you'll never be  
  
(Hey)  
I won't look prettier if I smile for the picture  
Motherfuckers never liked me then and they  
Sure won't like me now  
Don't try to drag me down with your cliche  
Your fake grin fits your faker face  
But I find pleasure in your misery  
  
Yeah  
I will step on you on my way up  
And I will step on you on my way back down  
I will step on you on my way up  
And I will step on you on my way back down

I'm the better of two evils (yeah yeah yeah)  
I want to hang all you cattle  
With your velvet rope  
Motherfuckers step up and get into  
An orderly line.  
I'll Show you how to make a muscle:  
It takes less strength to grin than  
It does to spit on all you  
Paparazzi Nazis  
  
Yeah  
I will step on you on my way up  
And I will step on you on my way back down
