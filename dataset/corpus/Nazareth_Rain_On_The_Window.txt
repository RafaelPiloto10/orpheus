Round about midnight  
I feel the chill closin' in  
Living my stage fright  
I need the sun to begin - tomorrow  
  
Thinking 'bout my life  
And all the changes she made  
And when she went running out  
All the colors fade - to midnight  
  
[Chorus:]  
What a bad week I've had  
There's rain on the window  
What a bad week I'm sad  
There's rain on my window  
  
Will I be staying  
Or am I moving in  
Am I still standing  
I've gotta wait - she's choosing  
  
[Chorus]  
What a bad week I've had  
There's rain on the window  
What a bad week I'm sad  
There's rain on the window  
  
When the sun comes up, it dries that rain on the window [Repeat: x5]
