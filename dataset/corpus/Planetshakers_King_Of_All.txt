You are the light that broke through the night  
And made a way for all mankind  
You are the One, God's risen Son  
You are the Savior of the world  
  
Oh Lord, where would we be without Your love  
Oh Lord, where would we be without Your love  
  
Glory to the risen King we sing all our praise  
  
Honor to the One who took our sin, Jesus  
Worthy to receive all majesty You our Lord  
King of all  
  
We cry out to You King of all  
Come fill us with Your love for all  
That all may know You and all will sing  
Glory to the King
