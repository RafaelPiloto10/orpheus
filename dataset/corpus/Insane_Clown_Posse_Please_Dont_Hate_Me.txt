I gotta tell him..  
I gotta be a man and handle my business..  
I know he's gonna hate me..  
Ahhh I gotta call him  
What up dogg?  
What you been up to?  
Oh yeah well that's cool, check it out  
Me and you we been down for while, right?  
We been here and there we been pretty tight  
Something happened last night that you might get upset about  
But hear me out  
I didn't mean nothing by it, I'ma make this quick  
I gave your mama this dick  
I don't know how it happened  
I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping  
I was over there mowing the grass  
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass  
And then, I went inside to make a phone call  
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra  
One thing just led to another  
Next thing you know, I'm butt-fucking your mother  
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately  
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.  
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately  
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo.  
Don't hang up, I still got more  
Your momma gives head like a heroin whore  
I wasn't thinking about how you was my bud  
When she spread my butt cheeks and went for the Milk Dud  
We broke out with your with grandpa's gin  
Got drunk, I fucked her with a bowling pin  
She's freaky  
Her nipples look like peanuts  
Your mama's one of my favorite sluts  
She likes licking from the back of my balls  
to the tip of my dick with one big lick  
She calls me her big teddy bear  
Roooaaaaarrrrr!!!!!  
I chase her around on my underwear  
I'll admit I like spanking her butt  
I used your sock though to catch my nut  
Don't worry  
I put it back, I knew you better  
That's probably why your toes been sticking together  
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately  
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.  
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately  
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo.  
Your mom's ass look like oat meal yo  
It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though  
And I ain't trying to diss her either  
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some  
Every hair is like a foot long  
Bitch looks like a werewolf wearing a thong sometimes  
It's all right with me though  
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole  
And your dad's so dumb he's knowing nothing  
Here I'm stuffing her muffin not to mention the pickle puffing  
And I'm hoping you and me are still cool  
I'm spending the night so she can drive me to school tomorrow  
And we plan on fucking again  
All right I'll talk to you later  
Peace Eminem  
Di-zam  
Somebody just got fucked up  
Nigga!
