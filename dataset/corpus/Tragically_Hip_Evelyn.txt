Evelyn-Evelyn  
Where were you last night?  
Evelyn-Evelyn  
Where were you last night?  
  
Waited on your front porch till the break of day  
But when the dawn broke I could no longer wait for  
  
Must have phoned a million times no answer came  
What kind of fool am I to play this game with  
  
This has gone on before  
I can't take it no more  
I'll even up the score and  
Get away from  
  
If you must have your way you won't have me  
I won't be pushed around I must get free from
