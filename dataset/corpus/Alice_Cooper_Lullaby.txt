I was the boy who said all of my prayers  
Laid my clean face on the pillow  
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure  
Through the night  
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing  
It pulled me right out of a dream  
If I knew it was you  
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed  
  
[Chorus]  
Get down, back where you started  
Get down, back into hell  
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted  
I smell your sulfurous smell  
  
All of my things that I play with in daylight  
You turn into monsters at night  
My toys were my friends  
Until you taught them all how to bite  
  
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see  
You scared me with visions of fire  
You danced on my bed  
With the flames on your head dancing higher  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tell you right now  
I don't want your reptile embrace  
I don't want to follow you down to your place  
I don't want to be a child of disgrace  
You can take your whiskey soaked, foaming  
at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup  
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was the boy who said all of my prayers  
Laid my clean face on the pillow  
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure  
Through the night
