Well, take me back down where cool water flow, yeh.  
Let me remember things I love.  
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite,  
Walkin' along the river road at night,  
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight.  
  
I can hear the bull frog callin' me.  
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.  
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water,  
Shoe fly, dragon fly, get back t your mother.  
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River.  
  
Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh,  
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers.  
Old Cody, Junior took me over,  
Said, you're gonna find the world is smouldrin'  
And if you get lost come on home to Green River.
