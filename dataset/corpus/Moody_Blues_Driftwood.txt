Just like the driftwood of a dream  
Left on the seashore of sleep  
Just like the words that wouldn't rhyme  
Lost in the desert of time  
Time waits for no one at all  
No, not even you  
You thought you'd seen it all before  
You really thought you knew  
I don't remember what was said  
In the confusion that night  
I only know what's on my mind  
What's in the future, we will decide  
Time waits for no one at all  
No, not even you  
You thought you'd seen it all before  
You really thought you knew  
I've shattered the illusion of fortune and of fame  
But darling, now I know you  
Life could never be the same  
Oh no, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  
Time waits for no one my love  
No, not even you  
You thought you'd seen it all before  
You really thought you knew  
I've shattered the illusion of fortune and of fame  
I'm waking up, I'm reaching up  
I'm getting up from this game  
Oh no, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  
Oh no, don't, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  
Oh no, don't, don't leave me driftwood on the shore
