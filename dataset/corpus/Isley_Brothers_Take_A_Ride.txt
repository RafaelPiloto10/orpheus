Listen, baby  
  
You need direction, love and affection  
Someone to be there, a man that truly cares  
Put your trust in me, and I will set you free  
I know of a better place  
And I happen to be going that way  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
Take a ride with me, baby  
On a highway that leads to love  
Come with me, sail free under the sky way  
Just both of us  
  
Relax, enjoy the ride  
'Cause soon we will be there  
Leave troubles way behind  
'Cause joy is waiting there  
So hold on to my hand  
Picture us on a island  
Making love on the pouring rain  
You and me will be like cast away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soon we'll reach our destiny  
Once we're there, we'll know we're free  
Your body screaming as we lay  
Girl, our love, take us away  
  
[Chorus]
