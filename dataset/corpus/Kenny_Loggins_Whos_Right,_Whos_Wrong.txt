(This is it)  
I've grown tired of fighting  
Whether you're right or wrong  
Whether I'm weak or strong in your eyes  
'Cause this is a lonely feeling  
Watching you turn away  
Why does it have to be this way?  
On and on tonight  
You've made a point of being right  
Making this a game instead of love  
You should know  
Where this goes.  
Someone's heart will surely be broken  
Before too long  
If we keep on playing this game  
Of right or wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
Who's right, who's wrong  
When love is gone?  
Who's right or wrong -- false or true  
Never used to matter to you  
You're almost crying  
Saying "I've gotta run"  
Easier said than done  
  
Tell me why  
I want to know what you're hiding  
Turn around and look at me  
I've never been this hard to see before  
If we'd only come together  
For a moment here tonight  
You could hold me tight  
And ease your troubled mind  
You should know  
Where this goes  
Someone's heart will surely be broken  
Before too long,  
If we keep on playing this game  
Of right or wrong  
  
Right or wrong, lady  
Right or wrong, baby  
I'm right, you're wrong lady  
You're right, I'm wrong, baby  
Talkin' about who's right or wrong  
It never really matters  
When your love is gone  
Sayin' it out  
This right is wrong  
If all our lovin' is gone
