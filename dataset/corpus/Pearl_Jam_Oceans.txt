Hold on to the thread  
The currents will shift  
Glide me towards  
You know something's left  
And we're all allowed  
To dream of the next  
Oh, oh the next, time we touch  
  
Uh huh, uh huh  
Uh huh, uh huh  
  
You don't have to stray  
Tho oceans away  
Waves roll in my thoughts  
Hold tight the ring  
The sea will rise  
Please stand by the shore  
Oh, oh, oh, I will be  
I will be there once more  
  
Uh huh, uh huh  
Uh huh, uh huh  
Uh huh, uh huh  
Uh huh, uh huh  
Uh huh, uh huh
