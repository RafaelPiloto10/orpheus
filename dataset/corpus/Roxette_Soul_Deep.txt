Save a prayer for a sinner and a saint,  
My baby's coming back.  
Say a prayer, hide hide away yea baby's coming back.  
Hey hey hey, ain't gonna trouble his wandering mind,  
Gonna take on the time to find out if my love is  
  
Soul deep  
Spinning the heart round a wire.  
Soul deep  
A heavenly wave.  
Soul deep  
Heating the heart like a fire,  
Soul deep is taking my breath away-ay-ay.  
  
Save a tear till the curtain will fall,  
Well I'm saving them all for you.  
Knock on wood,  
Is it understood that I'm saving it up for you.  
Hey hey hey,  
Love is a hustle just a moment behind,  
Gonna walk on the line to find out if my love is  
  
Soul deep  
Save a prayer for a sinner and a saint,  
My baby's coming back.  
Say a prayer, hide hide away yea yea baby's coming back.  
Hey hey hey ride on the soul train now I'm too close to hide,  
Gonna take on the time to find out if my love is soul deep
