You give me your smile  
A piece of your heart  
You give me the feel I've been looking for  
You give me your soul  
Your innocent love  
You are the one I've been waiting for  
I've been waiting for  
  
We're lost in a kiss  
A moment in time  
Forever young  
Just forever, just forever in love  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart  
  
Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
  
You make me dream  
By the look in your eyes  
You give me the feel, I've been longing for  
I wanna give you my soul  
All my life  
Cause you are the one I've been waiting for  
I've been waiting for so long  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin' round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart  
Into my heart  
  
Just forever in love  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin' round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart  
When you came into my life  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin' round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart
