Tears of joy at the birth of a brother  
Never alone from that time  
Sixteen Years through knife fights and danger  
Strangely why his life not mine  
  
West side skyline crying  
Fallen angel dying  
Risk a life to make a dime  
  
Lifetimes spent on the streets of a city  
Make us the people we are  
Switchblade stings in one tenth of a moment  
Better get back to the car  
  
Fallen angel  
Fallen angel  
  
West side skyline  
Crying for an angel dying  
Life expiring in the city  
  
Snow white side streets of cold New York City  
Stained with his blood it all went wrong  
Sick and tired blue wicked and wild  
God only knows for how long  
  
Fallen angel...
