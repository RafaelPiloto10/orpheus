I have to come and see you  
Maybe once or twice a year  
I think nothing would suit me better  
(Right now)  
Than some downtown atmosphere  
In the dance halls and the galleries  
Or betting in the OTB  
Synchronized, like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
The sun goes down in Jersey  
Rises over Little Italy,  
We could talk it up 'til the block gets up  
Swapping stories  
Sitting around in some all night zoo  
Watching it run like a movie  
Synchronized, like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
No hearts of gold  
No nerves of steel  
No blame for what we can and cannot feel  
  
But now it's cloak and dagger  
Walk on eggshells and analyze  
Every particle of difference  
Gets like mountains in our eyes  
You say, "You're unscrupulous!"  
You say, "You're naive!"  
Synchronized--like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
No hearts of gold  
No nerves of steel  
No blame for what we can and cannot feel  
  
Sometimes change comes at you  
Like a broadside accident  
There is chaos to the order  
Random things you can't prevent  
There could be trouble around the corner  
There could be beauty down the street  
Synchronized, like magic  
Good friends you and me  
  
No hearts of gold  
No nerves of steel  
No blame for what we can and cannot feel  
No nerves of steel  
No hearts of gold  
No blame for what we can and can't control  
  
Good friends you and me  
Good friends you and me
