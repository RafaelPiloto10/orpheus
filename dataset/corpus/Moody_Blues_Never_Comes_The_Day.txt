Work away today, work away tomorrow.  
Never comes the day for my love and me.  
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away.  
If only you knew what's inside of me now  
You wouldn't want to know me somehow,  
But  
You will love me tonight,  
We alone will be alright,  
In the end.  
  
Give just a little bit more  
Take a little bit less  
From each other tonight  
Admit what you're feeling  
And see what's in front of you,  
It's never out of your sight.  
You know it's true,  
We all know that it's true.  
  
Work away today, think about tomorrow  
Never comes the day for my love and me.  
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away.  
If only you knew what's inside of me now  
You wouldn't want to know me somehow,  
But  
You will love me tonight,  
We alone will be alright,  
In the end.  
  
Give just a little bit more  
Take a little bit less  
From each other tonight  
Admit what you're feeling  
And see what's in front of you,  
It's never out of your sight.  
You know it's true,  
We all know that it's true.
