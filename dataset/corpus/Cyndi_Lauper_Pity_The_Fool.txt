I pity the fool  
Yeah, I pity the fool  
  
That falls in love with you  
And expects you to be true  
That's why I pity that fool  
  
Chorus:  
look at the people  
i know you wonder what they're doing  
they're just standing there  
watching you make a fool of me  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Oh, I pity the fool  
Yeah, I pity the fool  
Hey, I pity the fool  
I pity the fool that falls in love with you  
  
He'll break your heart one day  
And he'll laugh and go on his way  
That's why I pity that fool  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
I pity the fool...  
I pity the fool that gives her heart to you  
  
He'll take her heart away  
And he'll find another fool to play  
That's why I pity that fool  
  
(repeat chorus)
