From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia  
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand  
And his daring life of crime  
Made him a legend in his time  
East and West of the Rio Grande  
Well he started with a bank in Colorado  
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid  
And his age and his size took the teller by surprise  
And word spread of Billy the Kid...  
Well he never traveled heavy  
Yes, he always rode alone  
And he soon put many older guns to shame  
And he never had a sweetheart  
And he never had a home  
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name  
Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma  
And the law just could not seem to track him down  
And it served his legend well  
For the folks they'd love to tell 'bout when Billy the Kid came to town  
Well one cold day a posse captured Billy  
And the judge said "String him up for what he did!"  
And the cowboys and their kin like the sea came pourin' in  
To watch the hangin' of Billy the Kid  
Well he never traveled heavy  
Yes, he always rode alone  
And he soon put many older guns to shame  
And he never had a sweetheart  
But he finally found a home  
Underneath the Boot Hill grave that bears his name.  
From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island  
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand  
And his daring life of crime  
Made him a legend in his time  
East and West of the Rio Grande
