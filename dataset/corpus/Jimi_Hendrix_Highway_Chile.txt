Yeah  
His guitar swung across his back  
His dusty boots and his Sears Cadillac  
Flamin' red hair just a blowin' in the wind  
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin  
  
He left home when he was seventeen  
The rest of the world he longed to see  
And everybody who knows the same old story  
A rolling stone gathers no moss  
  
Now you probably call him a tramp  
But it goes a little deeper than that  
He's a highway chile  
  
Yeah  
Now some people say he had a girl back home  
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong  
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad  
Kinda made him feel pretty sad  
  
I couldn't say what went through his mind  
Anyway he left the world behind  
And everybody knows the same old story  
Another war you can't lose in glory  
  
Now you probably call him a tramp  
But I know it goes a little deeper than that  
He's a highway chile  
One more brother  
Yeah!  
  
His old guitar swung across his back  
His dusty boots is his Cadillac  
Flamin' just a blowin' in the wind  
Ain't see a bed in so long it's a sin  
  
Now you may call him a tramp  
But I know it goes a little deeper than that  
He's a highway chile  
Walk on brother  
Don't let no one stop ya  
  
Highway chile  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Highway chile  
Go on down the highway  
Highway chile  
Yeah yeah  
Highway chile
