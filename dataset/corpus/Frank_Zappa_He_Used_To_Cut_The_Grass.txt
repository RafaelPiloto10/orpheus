Joe:  
I'm out at last  
Boy, the world sure looks different  
Wow . . . there's hardly anything fun to do  
Since they made music illegal  
But I'm hooked  
I got the habit  
I've got to have it  
I need to play  
But there's no musicians anymore  
They're all gone  
Wait! I've got it!  
I'll be sullen and withdrawn  
I'll dwindle off into the twilight realm  
Of my own secret thoughts  
I'll walk through the parking lot  
In a semi-catatonic state  
And dream of guitar notes  
To go with the loading zone announcements.  
  
Central Scrutinizer:  
  
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER  
The White Zone is for loading and unloading only.  
If you gotta load or unload, go to the White Zone.  
You'll love it.  
It's a way of life.

Mrs. Borg Voice:  
  
Turn it down!  
Turn it down!  
I have children sleeping here!  
Don't you boys know any nice songs?  
I'm calling the police!  
I did it!  
They'll be here . . . shortly!  
I'm not joking around anymore!  
You'll see now!  
There they are . . . they're coming!  
Just listen to that mess, would you!  
Every day this goes on around here!  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .  
He used to cut my grass . . .  
He was a very nice boy . . .

He was a very nice boy . . .  
  
Central Scrutinizer:  
  
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER . . . Yes . . . he used to be a nice boy . . .
He used to cut the grass . . . But now his mind is totally destroyed by music.
He's so crazy now he even believes that people are writing articles and
reviews about his imaginary guitar notes, and so, continuing to dwindle in the
twilight realm of his own secret thoughts, he not only dreams imaginary guitar
notes, but, to make matters worse, dreams imaginary vocal parts to a song
about the imaginary journalistic profession . . .
