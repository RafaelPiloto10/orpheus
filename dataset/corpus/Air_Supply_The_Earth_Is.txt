There's a man with the smallest of worlds in his hands  
And a tear fills his eyes as he tries to hold on  
Holding his world together  
  
There's a girl in the other half of the sky  
And she's wondering why her planet should sigh  
Don't you want me 'round forever  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise, moonfall, deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  
And we can't wait anymore, the time has come  
And those who need something more will feel the sun  
We're sharing one  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise, moonfall, deep in the heart  
A part of everyone  
  
And we can't wait anymore, the time is now  
You've got your foot in the door  
Get through somehow, break through somehow  
  
The earth is too small to be divided  
Sunrise, moonfall, deep in the heart  
A part of everyone
