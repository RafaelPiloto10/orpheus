This is for all the lonely people  
Thinking that life has passed them by  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
And ride that highway in the sky  
  
This is for all the single people  
Thinking that life has left them dry  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
You never know until you try  
  
Well, I'm on my way  
Yes, I'm back to stay  
Well, I'm on my way back home  
  
This is for all the lonely people  
Thinking that life has passed them by  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
She'll never take you down or  
Never give you up  
You'll never know until you try
