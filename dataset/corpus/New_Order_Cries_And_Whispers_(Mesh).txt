Below the surface this day I need it light  
Inside dimension lies another sacrifice  
Once out of reach, we never speak, we never compromise  
As they turned to gold the edges froze and seemed to turn to ice  
  
All flight departures assembled not returned  
Left in these passions I looked but never learned  
There's hope, you've heard there's life in another world  
Sometimes you'll find that truth is never kind  
In the ghost lies a portrait of space that time is never here  
In the mind of a fallen man, an easy day in another land  
Ship sails out to sea, away from me, I just stand and stare  
Assassin clears his lens, I know the end, I wasn't even there  
  
One day it came to mind we even leave the rest behind  
Some day, I know, you get where you should go  
There's hope, you've heard there's life in another world  
Sometimes we'll find that truth is never kind  
One day it came to mind we even leave the rest behind  
Some day, I know, we even get where we used to go  
There's hope, you've heard there's life in another world
