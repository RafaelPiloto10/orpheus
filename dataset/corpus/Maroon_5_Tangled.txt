I'm full of regret  
For all the things that I have done and said  
And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show  
My face 'round here  
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear  
  
Would you ever turn your head and look  
To see if I'm gone  
'Cause I fear  
  
[Chorus]  
There is nothing left to say to you  
That you want to hear  
That you want to know  
I think I should go  
The things I've done are way too shameful  
  
You're just an innocent  
A helpless victim of a spider's web  
And I'm an insect  
Going after anything that I can get  
So you'd better turn your head and run  
And don't look back  
Cause I fear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I have done you so wrong  
Treated you bad  
Strung you along  
Oh, shame on myself  
I don't know how I got so tangled up  
'Cause I fear  
  
[Chorus]
