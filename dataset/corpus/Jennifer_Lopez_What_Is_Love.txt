People told me,  
I should write a love song  
"Girl you sound so angry,  
You could use some variation"  
But I'm lonely  
Negative relations  
I've been hurt so many times  
I don't have the patience  
  
But I've wished for so long  
For someone to come and show me  
Lead by example  
'Cause I've been waiting  
I've tried every age  
I'm so tired of the game  
I wanna be somebody's girl  
Would you show me the way?  
  
What if I never find and I'm left behind?  
Should I keep hoping for love?  
What if I'm still the same?  
Status doesn't change?  
Gotta keep hoping for love  
  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
Somebody show me  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
'Cause if you told me  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
I wouldn't be lonely  
What is love?  
Please show me  
What is love?  
  
I've had blind dates  
Hooked up with some real flakes  
I've gone out with church boys  
Musician's are the worst  
I've tried so hard  
'Cause I'm just so die hard  
Tried my best to play the part  
Wish you could see inside  
  
But I've wished for so long  
For someone to come and show me  
Lead by example  
'Cause I've been waiting  
I've tried every age  
I'm so tired of the game  
I wanna be somebody's girl  
Would you show me the way?  
  
What if I never find and I'm left behind?  
Should I keep hoping for love?  
What if I'm still the same?  
Status doesn't change?  
Gotta keep hoping for love  
  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
Somebody show me  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
'Cause if you told me  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
I wouldn't be lonely  
What is love?  
Please show me  
What is love?

I've been alone  
For the past three years  
On Valentine's Day  
Christmas is no exception  
Birthday's with naughty presents  
Been back and forth, same action  
I just need this to happen  
I'll be singing love's praises  
If you would show me  
  
What if I never find and I'm left behind?  
Should I keep hoping for love?  
What if I'm still the same?  
Status doesn't change?  
Gotta keep hoping for love  
  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
Somebody show me  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
'Cause if you told me  
What is love?  
What is love?  
What is love?  
I wouldn't be lonely  
What is love?  
Please show me  
What is love?
