Came to Hollywood  
Gonna be a movie star  
She got off the bus  
But she didn't get far  
Now she can act as good as Meryl Streep  
Dreams of stardom when she sleeps  
The casting couch just makes her scream  
Wasn't like this in her dream  
  
[Chorus]  
Wishful thinking  
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me good!  
Wishful thinking yeah yeah  
Let's go  
  
Came to Hollywood  
Gonna be a big rock star  
He can play a million riffs on this here guitar  
Now he works two jobs, can't get a break  
Takes little white pills to stay awake  
No record deals just make him scream  
It wasn't like this in his dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(come on Bobby)  
(Yeah, I like that)  
  
Hollywood  
Superstars  
Rock n' roll Denny's  
Topless bars  
Do a porno movie, make some extra cash  
But you spend it all too fast  
Hollywood just make you scream  
It wasn't like this in your dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dream, wishful thinking  
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me good  
Wishful thinking yeah yeah  
Let's go
