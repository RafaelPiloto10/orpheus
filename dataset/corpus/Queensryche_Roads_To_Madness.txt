Most of this is memory now  
I've gone too far to turn back now  
I'm not quite what I thought I was but  
Then again I'm maybe more  
The blood-words promised, I've spoken  
Releasing the names from the circle  
Maybe I can leave here now and, o  
Transcend the boundaries  
  
For now I'm standing here  
I'm awaiting this grand transition  
The future is but past forgotten  
On the road to madness  
  
Times measure rusts as it crawls  
I see its face in the looking glass - stop  
This screaming laughter hides, the pain of its reality  
Black, the door was locked I opened  
And now I've paid that price ten-fold over  
Knowledge - was it worth such torment, oh  
To see the far side of shadow  
  
And still I'm standing here  
I'm awaiting this grand transition  
I'm a fool in search of wisdom  
And I'm on the road to madness  
Yes, I'm on the road to madness  
  
I'm awaiting endlessly  
Pounding rhythms echo me  
Won't you take me somewhere far beyond the void  
  
And still I'm standing here  
I'm awaiting this grand transition  
Maybe one day, oh I'll meet you, and we'll  
Walk the roads to madness  
Yes, we're on the road to madness  
  
Oh, I think they've come to take me  
I hear the voice, but there's no-one to see  
I can't scream, too late it's time  
  
Stay on the course to pass  
You'll never find the answer  
To a place where darkened angels  
Seemed lost and never found  
Scream to see the light of  
Forming figures fast behind you  
Lay the past in the wind to spin  
And your fate will sail beyond the open plains  
Sail with angels onward  
Live or die for the chosen one said  
Saber sights cast a spell behind you  
And they lock in all around  
  
Free the scene insider  
Never looking back to find why  
Ride a course till the end of time  
And you'll stand atop the gate  
Laying waste in a path recited  
Fighting force won't avenge the guided black wing  
Oh, electric might poses fright inside me  
Seeing light at the end of sight reminds me  
I've passed away
