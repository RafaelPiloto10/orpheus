An icy wind burns and scars  
Rushes in like a fallen star  
Through the narrow space  
Between these bars  
Looking down on Prison Grove  
  
Dug in, hunkered down  
Hours race without a sound  
Gonna carry me to where I'm bound  
Looking down on Prison Grove  
  
Iron will hard as rock  
Hold me up for the fateful knock  
When they walk me down in a mortal lock  
Out on Prison Grove  
  
Shine on all these broken lives  
Shine on  
Shine the light on me  
  
Knick Knack Paddy Wack  
They say you'll hear your own bones crack  
When they bend you back to bible black  
Then you'll find your love  
  
Some folks have to die too hard  
Some folks have to cry too hard  
Take one last look at the prison yard  
Goodbye Prison Grove  
  
Shine on all these broken lives  
Shine on  
Shine the light on me
