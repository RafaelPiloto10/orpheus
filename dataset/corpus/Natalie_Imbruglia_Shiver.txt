I walk a mile with a smile  
And I don't know  
I don't care where I am  
But I know it's alright  
  
Jump the tracks  
Can't get back  
I don't know anyone around here  
But I'm safe this time  
  
'cause when you  
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me  
Stupid things, like you do  
Yes, I  
Have to, have to, have to  
Change the rules  
I can't lose  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I shiver  
I just break up  
When I'm near you  
It all gets out of hand  
Yes I shiver  
I get bent up  
There's no way that  
I know you'll understand  
  
We talk and talk  
'round it all  
Who'd have thought  
We'd end up here  
  
But I'm feeling fine  
In a rush  
Never trust  
You'll be there  
  
If I'd only stop and take my time  
  
'Cause with you  
I'm running, running, running  
Somewhere I can't get to  
Yes I have to have to have to  
Change the rules  
I'm with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What if you get off at the next stop  
Would you just wave as I'm drifting off  
If I never saw you again  
Could I (could i)  
  
Keep all (all)  
Of this (of this)  
Inside  
  
[Chorus: x2]
