When I got told the other day, you said won't it be nice  
To spend some time and share a look there was no thinking twice  
The die was cast no time to lose as much as one can say  
Didn't hesitate to call you back and things were under way  
  
And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds  
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got  
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share  
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere  
  
Nothing to say  
We got it there  
A long long way  
Right in our hands  
  
Nothing to say  
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection  
We'll have our way  
Like we always do  
  
Nothing to say  
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection  
We'll have our way  
Like we always do  
  
You called me up the other day just when I thought you would  
And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good  
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease  
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece  
  
That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree  
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be  
  
'Cause it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test  
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest  
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place  
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere  
  
Nothing to say  
We got it there  
A long long way  
Thereof our hands  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh,oh  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
Nothing to say  
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection  
I'll make my way  
Like I always do  
  
I got  
I got nothing to say  
I got nothing  
Nothing to say  
  
I got way  
I still brave horizon  
Nothing to spilled  
Long long way  
Nothing to say
