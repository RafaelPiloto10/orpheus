Welcome home its been a while  
We've been expecting you  
You try to deny your family  
Oh, but we came through so  
Welcome,  
Welcome,  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
The waters gone, and the grain is back  
It's not exactly where you wanna be  
But we're the only true friends you've ever had  
This company loves your misery, so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
The acid burns and it takes its toll  
But we all get used to it  
There's no give and take  
Its just push and pull  
It only hurts for a bit, so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Its so endearing how you thought you could change  
We know you'll be happy  
You just need someone to blame  
Welcome back we're back  
We're glad you know your place  
Its always there for you  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And there's no where you can hide  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom
