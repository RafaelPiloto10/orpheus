New love is blind  
Why don't you see  
You hurt me inside, you're killing me  
It makes me sad all the time  
  
To see you around with all these guys  
My heart's in pain  
I need you so  
My love's the same  
So please don't go  
  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
  
Let's try again  
There's still romance  
We'll start a new life, take a chance  
There are so many ways  
  
Please don't forget it anyday  
My heart's in pain  
I need you so  
My love's the same  
So please don't go  
  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need
