I didn't hear what you were saying  
I live on raw emotion, baby  
I answer questions, never maybe  
And I'm not kind if you betray me  
So, who the hell are you to save me?  
I never would have made it, babe  
  
[Bridge]  
If you needed love  
Well, then, ask for love  
Could have given love  
Now I'm taking love  
And it's not my fault  
'Cause you both deserve  
What's coming now  
So don't say a word  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don't think so  
  
Would have bled to make you happy  
You didn't need to treat me that way  
And now you beat me at my own game  
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly  
And your lover's screaming loudly  
I hear a sound and hit the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don't feel so bad  
I don't feel so bad  
I don't feel so bad  
  
I'm so sorry, darling  
Did I do the wrong thing?  
Oh, what was I thinking?  
Is his heart still beating?  
  
Whoa, oh, oh  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don't feel so bad  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore, no  
He won't come around here?  
I don't feel so bad  
  
(Wake up call)  
(Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)  
(Don't you care about me anymore?)  
(Don't you care about me?)  
(I don't feel so bad)  
(Wake up call)  
(Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)  
(Don't you care about me anymore)
