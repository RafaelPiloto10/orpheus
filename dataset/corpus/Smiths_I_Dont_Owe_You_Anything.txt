Bought on stolen wine  
A nod was the first step  
You knew very well  
What was coming next  
  
Bought on stolen wine  
A nod was the first step  
You knew very well  
What was coming next  
  
Did I really walk all this way  
Just to hear you say :  
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight" ?  
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"  
  
Oh, but you will  
For you must  
  
I don't owe you anything, no  
But you owe me something  
Repay me now  
  
You should never go to them  
Let them come to you  
Just like I do  
Just like I do  
  
You should not go to them  
Let them come to you  
Just like I do  
Just like I do  
  
Did I really walk all this way  
Just to hear you say :  
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight" ?  
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"  
  
But you will  
For you must  
  
I don't owe you anything, no  
But you owe me something  
Repay me now  
  
Too freely on your lips  
Words prematurely sad  
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight  
  
Life is never kind  
Life is never kind  
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
