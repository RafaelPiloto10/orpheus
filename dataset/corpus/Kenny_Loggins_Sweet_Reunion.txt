In the moment I first saw you,  
I could swear that we had met,  
The look in your eye,  
Was so familiar,  
Where and when, I forget.  
  
Whispered your name in introduction,  
Darling, my heart filled the room,  
And I knew it was you, come back in my life.  
  
So we meet again, my long lost friend  
Once again, we get to start anew,  
And it feels like a thousand years,  
I've been loving you.  
  
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near,  
Searchin' the world for a friend,  
Come on in, I've been expecting you  
Sweet reunion, welcome home again.  
  
How many lifetimes have I loved you,  
How many times have you loved me,  
The sound of your voice is in my memory,  
Like the wind, on the sea.  
  
The glow of your heart has been my lighthouse,  
I've followed it in from distant shores,  
Now I won't be afraid to love anymore.  
  
So we meet again, my long lost friend  
Once again, we get to start anew,  
And it feels like a thousand years,  
I've been loving you.  
  
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near,  
Searchin' the world for a friend,  
Come on in, I've been expecting you  
Sweet reunion, welcome home again.  
  
Whatever happens, nothing's ever going to be the same,  
Now you'll find me here at last,  
Your love's released me from the past,  
My heart and soul have always remembered your name.  
  
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near,  
Searchin' the world for a friend,  
Come on in, I've been expecting you  
Sweet reunion, welcome home again.  
  
I've always been loving you  
  
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near,  
Searchin' the world for a friend,  
Come on in, I've been expecting you  
Sweet reunion, welcome home again.
