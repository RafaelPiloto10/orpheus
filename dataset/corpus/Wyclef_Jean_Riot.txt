[Wyclef:] Yo Serj, pass me that lighter...  
[Serj:] Here you go man  
  
Yeah... yeah  
  
[Both:] Yeah  
  
[Serj:] The power is smiling through the battle field...  
  
The break is over man  
I'm fat with the ink pen  
Like Ali Boom Bayay  
Okay I'm on my second wind  
Used to roll dice when the love was on my side, man  
Four, five, six walked away with the Grammy  
Seen many blocks turn to the Twilight Zone  
D.A. on a case like Sherlock Holmes  
My old high school sweetheart started sniffin' a bone  
For the right bag she deep blow deeper than the baritone  
I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected  
Check it  
Like when I rhyme don't big punch wreck it  
Check it  
I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter  
Lyrical dagger like alcohol I got pull your liver  
  
Quiver, shiver body temperature can found in Hudson River  
Deliver a message to your miss you won't be commin' over  
And if you on a street tonight  
See that refugee local  
We beam around the world like satellite  
  
[Chorus: 1]  
It's the hip hop boys, turn your radio down  
It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down  
It's the reggae boys, turn your radio down  
Neighbors mind your business  
  
[Chorus: 2]  
It's a riot... Trouble (comin') again, your body's getting nervous  
See we're trouble (comin') again, body so unconscious  
You see we're trouble (comin') again, your body's getting nervous  
See we're trouble (comin') again, body so unconscious  
  
[Sizzla:]  
Come rock with me  
I got the music on the block with me  
Come chill on the spot with me  
  
I'm just laughin' spree  
  
Yeah you're right we got enough for everyone  
So get all your friends and your families and come along  
Move to the beat that's all we do  
We got Jerusalem  
Everyday we offer praises like King Soloman  
  
Don't be nervous  
I'm your guardian angel, I know you're nervous  
And if I look at you now  
If I should make it  
Believe me  
I leave you, show you how to make it  
  
Pump up high  
N M I  
Double S - I  
S - S - I  
P ? P - I  
Three peace child  
Want to see me die  
So the heaven's get cry  
  
[Chorus: 1]  
  
It's a riot!  
Riot!  
Riot!  
Riot!  
From the train to the plane  
Security check  
From the bridge to the tunnel  
Security check  
  
[Chorus: 2]  
  
[Wyclef (Serj):]  
Let's go to Texas...  
Driving wreck-less  
Police stop me  
Ask me for my license  
(Oh yeah)  
Registration so I played him some Elvis  
He let me go  
Then I lit on the challas  
I said if things don't change  
We headed for the Armageddon  
Armageddon  
And the great dragon with seven heads ten horns  
At the Armageddon  
Listen to the choired church...  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
[Serj:]  
The matterings of all matter  
Masters and their extended batters  
Internet intelligence firm  
Investments for the natural world  
Their divestments  
Truth is knowledge  
Although bipolar if it's attainment is equitable  
Man's mirrors face the flesh  
But hide the spirit  
In opposite worlds  
Vision can only be attained universally  
Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades  
All having the propensity to illuminate  
Let's ruminate on realization  
That the means is the end  
The earth's water is mirroring the stream of consciousness  
The dead being reborn  
As flowers smiling through the battlefields  
  
It's the hip hop boys, turn your radio down  
It's the rock and roll boys, turn your radio down  
  
[Serj:] Power is smiling through the battle field...  
  
[Chorus: 2]
