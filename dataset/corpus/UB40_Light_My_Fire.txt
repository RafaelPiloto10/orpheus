You know that it would be untrue  
You know that it would be lie  
If I was to say to you  
Girl we couldn't get much higher  
  
The time to hesitate is true  
No time to wallow in the mire  
Try now we can only lose  
And our love becomes a funeral fire  
  
The time to hesitate is true  
No time to wallow in the mire  
Try now we can only lose  
And our love becomes a funeral fire  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on baby light my fire  
Come on baby light my fire  
Try to set the night on fire  
  
The time to hesitate is true  
No time to wallow in the mire  
Try now we can only lose  
And our love becomes a funeral fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know that it would be untrue  
You know that it would be a lie  
If I was to say to you  
Girl we couldn't get much higher  
  
[Chorus]
