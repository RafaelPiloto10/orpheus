Looking back upon my youth  
The time I always knew the truth.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
To go back in the yard and play  
If I could only have another day.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to make you cry.  
  
To go back  
On the hill beside the track  
And try to concentrate.  
All in all the places that I want to be,  
No, it shows you that I could not wait.  
  
So come back into my arms again.  
This love of ours, it has no end.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to make you cry.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to see you cry.  
  
To go back  
On the hill beside the track  
And try to concentrate.  
All in all the places that I want to be,  
No, it shows you that I could not wait.  
  
So come back into my arms again.  
This love of ours, it has no end.  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to say goodbye.  
  
I don't want to do it.  
I don't want to make you cry.
