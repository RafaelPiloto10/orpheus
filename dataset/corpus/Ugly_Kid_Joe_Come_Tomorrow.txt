About the time I'm eight years old  
I met the Devil, kept my soul  
Walkin' out on lakes of fire and I'm gone  
Walkin' in a wonderland  
And I don't really understand  
The place I'm comin' to right now today  
  
[Chorus]  
Come tomorrow, you could see the light  
Come tomorrow, break it right down to the place you were before  
  
Fifteen years on down the line  
I guess you'd say I'm doin' fine  
Wandering down that same old road again  
Walkin' in a wonderland  
But Alice doesn't understand  
The place she's comin' to right now today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On your knees, you'll be begging me please  
As you feel the disease  
You're going down again tonight  
  
See me runnin', watch me fall  
I guess you'd say I've finally found my own,  
See me cryin' and wonder why  
I guess you'd say its time to die today  
  
[Chorus]
