Come on, come on, baby  
Come on, come on, baby  
Come on, come on, come on  
And let's do the dance of love  
I gotta tell you  
Really gotta swingin' bad now  
You really gotta swingin' bad now  
We do, want you to come on  
And let's do the dance of love  
Every time I see you  
Dancing 'round and 'round, yeah  
And it makes me wanna jump  
Right straighted up and down  
'Cause I really dig you, baby  
I really dig you, baby  
I do, love you so come on  
And let's do the dance of love  
Come on, baby  
Do the dance of love...
