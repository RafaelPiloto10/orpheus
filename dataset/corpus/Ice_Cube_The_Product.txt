I was told cause I didn't witness the whole act  
In and out was the movement of the bozack  
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin  
Then the nut came gushin  
And it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary  
With nothin' but the Lord lookin' over me  
I was white with a tail  
But when I reached the finish line young black male!  
One cell made two and two cells made fo'  
And so on so now I'm a embryo  
Then I got a hunch  
That I'ma be on lock down, for nine months  
Chillin', with my mother to guide me  
And nothin' but a stomach to hide me  
From all that worry and bullshit  
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick  
Cause my time is up and I don't care  
With one big push, I'm outta there  
June 15th, it's just my luck  
In 1969, a nigga is the product  
  
"Ghetto ass nigga, you ain't shit,  
And you ain't gon' never be shit!"  
  
I learned how to walk and talk and all that  
They put me in school, but it don't matter  
Cause I'm sittin' in history  
Learnin' bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me  
They try to shape us  
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfuckin' rapist  
So I stopped payin' attention  
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention  
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways  
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's  
A high school dropout  
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out  
But I got tossed, he's the boss  
I'm out of there and mad cause I lost  
Now bein' on my own is a factor  
So I become, the neighborhood jacker  
Gimme your car, run your jewels  
Makin' a livin' robbin' fools  
And if I let my nine rang out  
You know, it'll make your brains hang out  
So what's your fate?  
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?  
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled  
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red  
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck  
Stuck up by the motherfuckin' product  
  
"Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job  
If you want to stay in my motherfuckin' house"  
  
"Many young men reject the traditional values  
That are important to their parents.  
Church, school and family  
Have been replaced by street, turf, and gang."  
  
Twenty-one now, and paid in full  
Feelin' bad, from all the shit I pulled  
On people back in the day  
Plus, I got a little baby on the way  
So I'm tryin' to go straight  
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date  
Til the punk ass cops ran my plate  
Now I'm on a bus upstate  
  
"Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!"  
"Sittin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace"  
  
Sent to a concrete hoe-house  
Where all the products go, no doubt  
Yo momma, I gotta do eleven  
Livin' in a five by seven  
Dear baby, your man's gettin' worn out  
Of seein' young boys gettin' they assholes torn out  
And then he got shanked with a spoon  
And he was 'sposed to get out soon  
Is it my fault, he was caught in production  
Where a young black life means nothin'  
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar  
You say I'm better off in the slammer  
And it's drivin' me batty  
Cause my little boy, is missin' daddy  
I'm ashamed, but the fact is  
I wish pops let me off on the mattress  
Or should I just hang from the top bunk  
But that's goin out like a punk  
My life is fucked!  
But it ain't my fault, cause I'm the motherfuckin' product  
  
"He ain't shit"
