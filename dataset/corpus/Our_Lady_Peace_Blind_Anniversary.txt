From Demo  
  
Well I want to know what's happening  
I want to know the time  
You're talking to God and looking the other way  
You're losing your mind  
  
And when you close your eyes  
The celebration ends  
And there'll be no more lies  
It's just another blind (blind) anniversary  
Blind (blind) Anniversary-hehaheyeaahhhhhhh  
  
Well I want to know where the country is  
And I want the other side  
You're fighting the pain  
And fighting the push and pull  
And leave it behind  
  
And when you realize much more than this  
But I'm too limb to celebrate this blind (blind) anniversary  
Blind (blind) Anniversary-hehaheyeaahhhhhhh  
  
It's just another blind (blind) anniversary  
Blind (blind) Anniversary-hehaheyeaahhhhhhh  
  
It's just another blind (blind) anniversary yeah  
Around we go  
Around we go  
Around we go  
Round and round we go  
  
And I want to and you want to  
And you want its happening  
  
And I want to and you want to  
And you no no no no  
  
But maybe that's just me
