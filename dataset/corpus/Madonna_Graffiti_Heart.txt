[Verse 1]  
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all  
Then it would be illegal  
As [?] go away, what would your body say?  
Don't ever hide your feelings  
  
[Refrain]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Don't ever try to take my freedom  
Oh, oh, oh  
Your imperfections, this world needs them  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What do you got? Show me your box [?]  
He didn't keep it all to himself  
Even with [?] out on the street, he died  
Fighting so you can do it as well  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is pain and pain is art!  
Show me your graffiti heart  
Love is pain and pain is art!  
Show me your graffiti heart  
  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
Free to shoulder feelings, painting from the ceiling  
Back in the beginning  
Nothing's what it seems, she painted all her dreams  
Made her own reality  
  
[Refrain]  
Oh, oh, oh  
Don't ever try to take my freedom  
Oh, oh, oh  
Your imperfections, this world needs them  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What do you got? Show me your box [?]  
He didn't keep it all to himself  
Even with [?] out on the street, he died  
Fighting so you can do it as well  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is pain and pain is art!  
Show me your graffiti heart  
Love is pain and pain is art!  
Show me your graffiti heart  
  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah  
  
[Bridge]  
We can break down and take down  
But they can't destroy our history  
This wall, it must fall  
To make room for our masterpiece  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is pain and pain is art!  
Show me your graffiti heart  
Love is pain and pain is art!  
Show me your graffiti heart  
  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah  
  
[Outro]  
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all  
Then it would be illegal
