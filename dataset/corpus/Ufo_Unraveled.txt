(instrumental intro)  
Yes she will be beautiful  
And you will be vain  
When the honeymoon is over  
She will suck out your brain  
Give me back my life  
Give me back my call  
Simply set me free  
Stop banging my head on the wall  
  
Put a black hat on me  
Take out a voodoo bone  
And the scars across my ceiling  
They paint a picture to the great unknown  
I'm coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
It's taking it's toll  
And the lamps keeps sliding  
Across the kitchen floor  
And there's something to remember  
Is this the life of a cross-cut saw  
And I'm coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
I'm becoming unstable  
I'm still paying the toll  
Great expectations will have a glitch  
Searching for power, may kill the bitch  
Theater of pain  
Love or lust in vain  
Unraveled again!  
Give me back my life,  
Give me back my call  
Simply set me free,  
Stop banging my head on the wall  
She will be beautiful,  
And you will be vain  
When the honeymoon is over,  
She will suck out your brain  
I'm coming unraveled,  
Spinning out of control  
I'm becoming unstable,  
And I can't, I can't let go  
(instrumental)  
Coming unraveled,  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
Nobody, nobody knows  
I'm coming unraveled,  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable,  
I can't, I can't let go  
(instrumental and vocals fade out)
