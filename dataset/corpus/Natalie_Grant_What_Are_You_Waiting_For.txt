Sometimes I get that overwhelming feeling  
So sad those faces on TV  
If I tried to make a difference would it help  
But then I stop and to myself I say  
  
[Chorus]  
So you wanna change the world  
What are you waiting for  
You say you're gonna start right now  
What are you waiting for  
It only takes once voice  
So come on now and shout it out  
Give a little more  
What are you waiting for  
  
Sometimes I feel a little helpless  
Seems like I can't do a thing  
But anything is possible just you wait and see  
Good things happen if you just believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday somehow  
Gonna take that step  
Cause time is ticking away  
  
Right here right now  
Before it's too late  
Gonna face tomorrow today  
  
[Chorus]
