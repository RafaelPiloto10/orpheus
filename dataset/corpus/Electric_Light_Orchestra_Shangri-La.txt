Sitting here, waiting for,  
Someone calling at my door,  
Too bad,  
I'm getting out of love.  
  
What's the use of changing things,  
Wonder what tomorrow brings,  
Who knows,  
I'm getting out of love.  
  
CHORUS  
My Shangri-la has gone away,  
Faded like the Beatles on Hey Jude  
She seemed to drift out on the rain  
That came in somewhere softly from the blue  
  
Clouds roll by and hide the sun,  
Raindrops fall on everyone,  
So sad,  
I'm getting out of love.  
  
CHORUS -- repeat x2
