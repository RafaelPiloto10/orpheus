On top of a hill is a nice place to be at  
Diggin' the country for miles around  
Watchin' the people like ants on a hillside  
Running around, running around  
  
So far below me I see the confusion  
Small-minded men with their small-minded wives  
If they could see themselves where I am standing  
They'd alter their lives, alter their lives  
  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
Climb up here, jump up here  
Skip up, or run up  
Get up here somehow ''cause you'll find your head  
Finally finding the level you're after  
Ego is dead, ego is dead  
  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
  
Wish they'd start using the path of tomorrow  
There's only way up and one way down  
Decide for yourself on the path you'll be taking  
When you look down, down and around  
  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky...
