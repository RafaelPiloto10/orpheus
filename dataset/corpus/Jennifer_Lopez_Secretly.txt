It's like I'm lost  
I don't know  
But this feeling  
That I have about you  
Will you ever know?  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
Whatever I see  
When I look at you across the room  
Whatever I hear  
I wonder if he loves me too  
Whatever I do  
I just think about you for hours  
Oh baby  
Has got me thinking of you  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
Whenever you speak  
Whenever you move  
Whenever you breath  
Baby let me touch you  
Please  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
It smells so good  
I just want to ... kiss you  
I want to ... lay with you  
I don't know how to tell you
