Oh, great good golly, he thrills me so  
When the apple of my eye whispers in my ear  
I get real speechless and I act so shy  
And all I can say is neenie-neenie-ny  
  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
I go, well ah-ah-ah...  
What I'm tryin' to say is  
  
I love you, yeah!  
I met him one day at the candy shop  
My heart started poppin' like a popcorn pop  
When he walked up and said, hi sweety pie  
  
Well, all I could say is neenie-neenie-ny  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
I went, well ah-ah-ah-bah...  
  
I love you, yeah!  
I love him so and he loves me too  
He's my flat top honey, stands six feet two  
I get an itchy twitchy feeling  
  
When he looks into my eyes  
But all I can say is neenie-neenie-ny  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
  
I go... oh-wah-eh honey  
I love you, yeah!  
All I can say is neenie-neenie-ny  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
I go... oh-wah-eh honey... I want to say...
