You haunt my room in the dead of night  
I see your face in the firelight  
Your hungry kiss I can't forget  
But I won't give it to you yet  
You got moves make a good girl sweat  
You won't catch me in your net  
You work your magic on my blues  
But I ain't no slave for you to use  
I won't beg and I won't crawl  
I won't be your voodoo doll  
Baby I won't be your voodoo doll  
Stirring up a potion of colors  
Making me crazy  
You got something I can't leave alone  
Shaking me  
Tremble...you're calling me baby  
Heaven help me turn my heart to stone  
Hey moon man - don't shine on me  
You are dnagerous company  
I got treasure in my chest  
And the price is high for all the rest  
Ain't no snake inside my wall  
I won't be your voodoo doll  
Baby I won't be your voodoo doll
