I was a city boy  
Caught up in a city way  
A nitty gritty boy  
Was out all night  
And always gettin' blown away  
  
[Chorus]  
There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love  
  
She was a city girl  
With no responsibility  
A pretty little city girl  
All fired up and what's  
That got to do to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
Its the heat when I fall on my knees(yeah)  
That I'm thinkin' of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Its as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
It's the heat when I fall on my knees  
That I'm thinkin' of  
  
[Chorus]
