Do you feel sorry lover?  
Do you feel blue?  
What reason did you have  
To be untrue?  
Now you could be so good  
But you have to be so bad  
When you could make me  
Happy lover  
You make me sad.  
  
Now there's a cool breeze blowin'  
Blowin' out the flame  
That used to burn inside me  
At the mention of your name,  
Now there's a cool breeze blowin'  
Blowin' down the track -  
That's where I'm goin'  
And I'm never comin' back...  
  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
Tonight - oh yea...  
  
Now there's nothing  
Comes from nothing  
That's what they always say  
Didn't mama tell ya  
That's the price you have to pay?  
Now you can't have  
Your piece of cake  
And eat the sweet thing too  
But that kind of understanding  
Isn't good enough for you  
My my - baby's gonna cry
