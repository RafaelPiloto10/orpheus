This nine pound hammer  
Is a little too heavy  
Buddy for my size  
Buddy for my size  
So I'm going on the mountain  
Just to see my baby  
And I ain't coming back  
No I ain't coming back  
Roll on, buddy  
Don't you roll so slow  
Well, tell me how can I roll  
When the wheels won't go  
Roll on, buddy  
Pull your load of coal  
Tell me how can I pull  
When the wheels won't roll  
It's a long way to Harlan  
It's a long way to Hazard  
Just to get a little brew  
Just to get a little brew  
And when I'm long gone  
You can make my tombstone  
Out of number nine coal  
Out of number nine coal  
Roll on, buddy  
Don't you roll so slow  
Well, tell me how can I roll  
When the wheels won't go  
Roll on, buddy  
Pull your load of coal  
Tell me how can I pull  
When the wheels won't roll
