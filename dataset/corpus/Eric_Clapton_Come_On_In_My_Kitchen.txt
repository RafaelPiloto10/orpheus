You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
Ah, the woman I love, took from my best friend  
Some joker got lucky, stole her back again  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
Oh ah, she's gone, know she won't come back  
I've taken the last nickel out of her nation sack  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down  
Lookin' for her good friend, none can be found  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
Winter time's comin', it's gon' be slow  
You can't make the winter, babe, just drive a little slow  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
