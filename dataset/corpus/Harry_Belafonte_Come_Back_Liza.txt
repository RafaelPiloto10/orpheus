Whenever I'm away from Liza, water come to me eye  
Every time I'm away from Liza, water come to me eye  
  
[Chorus]  
Come back Liza, come back girl  
Wipe the tear from me eye  
Come back Liza, come back girl  
Wipe the tear from me eye  
  
When the evening starts to fall, water come to me eye  
I need to hear my liza call, water come to me eye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Standing here in the marketplace, water come to me eye  
I need to see my Liza's face, water come to me eye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whenever I'm away from Liza, water come to me eye  
Whenever I'm away from Liza, water come to me eye  
  
[Chorus]
