Be prepared! That's the Boy Scout's marching song,  
Be prepared! As through life you march along.  
Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well,  
Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell.  
  
Be prepared! To hide that pack of cigarettes,  
Don't make book if you cannot cover bets.  
Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure  
That they will not be found  
And be careful not to smoke them  
When the scoutmaster's around  
For he only will insist that it be shared.  
Be prepared!  
  
Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' solemn creed,  
Be prepared! And be clean in word and deed.  
Don't solicit for your sister, that's not nice,  
Unless you get a good percentage of her price.  
  
Be prepared! And be careful not to do  
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you.  
If you're looking for adventure of a  
new and different kind,  
And you come across a Girl Scout who is  
similarly inclined,  
Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared.  
Be prepared!
