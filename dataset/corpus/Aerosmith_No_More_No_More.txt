Blood stains the ivorys  
Of my Daddy's baby grand  
I ain't seen no daylight  
Since we started this band  
No More, No More  
No More, No More  
  
Store bought clothes  
Fallin' appart at the seams  
Tea leaf readin' gypsies  
Fortune tellin' my dreams  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Holiday inns, lock the door with a chain  
You love it and you hate it  
But to me they're all the same  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Baby I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage  
  
Stalemate jailbait  
Ladies can't refuse  
You love 'em then you leave 'em  
With your sold out reviews  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Sweet talkin' barroom, ladies disease  
Slippin' with her lips  
Slidin' down your knees  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Baby I'm a screamer  
Bound to a wife in marriage  
Baby, I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage  
  
Ladies hold the aces  
And their lovers call it passion  
The men call it pleasure  
But to me it's old fashioned  
  
Times they're a changin'  
Nothin' ever stands still  
If I don't stop changin'  
I'll be writin' out my will  
  
It's the same old story  
Never get a second chance  
For a dance to the top of the hill  
  
Baby I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage
