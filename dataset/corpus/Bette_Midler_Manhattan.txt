Summer journeys to Niagra  
And to other places aggravate all our cares.  
We'll save our fares!  
I've a cozy little flat in  
What is known as old Manhattan  
We'll settle down  
Right here in town!  
We'll have Manhattan  
The Bronx and Staten Island too.  
It's lovely going through the zoo!  
(Sing to me, Bette, come on)  
It's very fancy  
on old Delancy street you know. (I know)  
The subway charms us so  
When balmy breezes blow  
To and fro.  
I'd like to take a  
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you,  
And fair Canarsie's Lakes we'll view.  
The city's bustle cannot destroy  
Oooh, the dreams of a girl and boy  
We'll turn Manhattan  
Into an isle of joy.  
Ooh, yeah  
And tell me what street  
compares with Mott Street in July?  
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.  
The great big city's a wonderous toy  
Ooh, just made for a girl and boy.  
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy!  
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy!
