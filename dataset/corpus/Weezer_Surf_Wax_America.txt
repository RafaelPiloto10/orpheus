[Chorus:]  
The sea is foamin' like a bottle of beer  
The wave is comin but I ain't gonna fear  
I'm waxin' down so that I'll go real fast  
I'm waxin' down because it's really a blast  
I'm goin' surfin 'cause I don't like your face  
I'm bailin' out because I hate the race  
Of rats that run round and round in the maze  
I'm goin' surfin', I'm goin' surfin'!  
  
You take your car to work  
I'll take my board  
And when you run out of fuel  
I'm still afloat  
  
My buddies and their honeys all come along  
They seem invincible as they surf along  
The sea is rollin' like a thousand pound keg  
We're goin' surfin', we're goin' surfin!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
All along the undertow is strengthening it's hold  
I never thought it'd come to this  
Now I can never go home  
All along the undertow is strengthening it's hold  
I never thought it'd come to this  
Now I can never go home  
  
[Chorus]
