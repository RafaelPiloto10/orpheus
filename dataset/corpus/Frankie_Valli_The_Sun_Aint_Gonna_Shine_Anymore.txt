Loneliness is the coat you wear  
A deep shade of blue is always there  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky  
Tears are always clouding your eyes  
When you're without love  
Baby  
  
Emptiness is the place you're in  
Nothing to lose, but no more to win  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky  
Tears are always clouding your eyes  
When you're without love  
Lonely  
Without you  
Baby  
Oh, I need you  
I can't go on  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky  
Tears are always clouding your eyes  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
When you're without love  
  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
Not anymore  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
Bring it back, baby  
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore  
Oh, baby
