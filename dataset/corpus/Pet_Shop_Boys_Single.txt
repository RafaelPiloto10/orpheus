They call this a community  
I like to think of it as home  
Arriving at the airport  
I am going it alone  
Ordering a boarding pass  
Travelling in business class  
This is the name of the game  
I'm single bilingual  
Single bilingual  
I come to the community from U.K.p.I.c.  
Arriving at my hotel  
There are faxes greeting me  
Staying in a junior suite  
So there's room to meet and greet  
And after work explain how I feel  
?Perdoneme me Ilamo Neil'  
I'm single bilingual  
Single bilingual  
In Brussels Bonn or Bacelona  
I'm in demand and quite at home there  
?Adelante!'  
Through the door  
?Un momento por favor'  
This is what I get paid for  
?Muchas gracias senor'  
I'm a player in the continental game  
With unlimited expenses to reclaim  
Information's ease  
Tapping at my PC  
That is the frame of the game  
I'm single bilingual  
Single bilingual  
I'm single bilingual  
Single bilingual  
Hay una discoteca por acqui?
