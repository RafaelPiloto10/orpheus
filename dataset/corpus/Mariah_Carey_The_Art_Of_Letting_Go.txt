I'm making a statement of my own opinion  
Just a brief little reminder to help myself remember  
I no longer live in your dominion (no, no, no, ooh)  
You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability  
Got up and laid all your possessions  
Outside the kitchen window right now  
  
Letting go, letting go ain't easy  
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful  
'Cause somebody you used to know  
It's flinging your world around  
And they watch, as you're falling down, down, down  
Falling down, baby  
  
Evidently your words were merely lies  
Reverberating in my ears  
And the echo won't subside  
There's a deep deep loss of hope  
And the anger burns in me  
I hope you don't get no ideas 'bout re-uniting baby  
'Cause that's the last thing I truly need  
Your audacity is too much to be believed, so  
Go to MiMi on your contacts, press delete  
  
Letting go ain't easy  
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful  
'Cause somebody you used to know  
It's flinging your world around  
And they watch, as you're falling down, down  
Down, down  
  
Baby letting go, baby letting go  
Ain't easy, ain't easy  
Baby letting go, baby letting go (Woah)  
Ain't easy, ain't easy (No)  
  
Baby letting go, it ain't easy  
'Cause somebody you used to know  
It's flinging your world around  
And you know what?  
They watch as you're falling, as you're falling  
Down  
Fall  
It ain't easy baby
