Tell me I'm dreaming  
My feet are stone and my light is dim  
Chasing this demon on his way down  
  
But whatever happened?  
Whatever happened?  
  
Spent the night out on a hill  
And watched the world sleep sound and still  
And over mountains darkness spilled  
Washed me over  
  
Whatever happened?  
Whatever happened?  
  
Its been a long way back  
From the edge of that  
Saw the world from a hill  
And right back where it started  
And it still feels right  
Like the very first time  
Saw the world like a kid  
Yesterday is over,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
City gates of rusted iron  
Can't contain the light inside  
So I spot this devil at the county line,  
And went no further  
  
And whatever happened?  
Whatever happened?  
  
Its been a long way back  
From the edge of that  
Saw the world from a hill  
And right back where it started  
And it still feels right  
Like the very first time  
Saw the world like a kid  
Yesterday is over,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
After all the time is gone,  
I'll have moved on  
  
Its been a long way back  
From the edge of that  
When the world was a kid  
And right back where it started  
And it still feels right  
Like the very first night  
Saw the world like a kid,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
I saw the world from a hill,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
I saw the world like a kid,  
Lets write another story,  
Write another story tonight!
