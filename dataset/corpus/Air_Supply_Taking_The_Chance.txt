You're in-between a page of life you never dreamed  
The answer won't come from that magazine  
this time it's real and you're not sure just what to feel  
Who can I trust to say  
Should I give love now should I take love now  
  
CHORUS  
I'm taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
  
Sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near  
I needed to make this choice on my own  
To let love in when I'm so scared when things begin  
Don't run away I feel close to you now  
You know I need you now  
  
CHORUS  
I'm taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
I'm taking the chance  
I can't let this feeling leave  
I don't want those nights of waiting so long  
I'm taking the chance before it's gone  
  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
On you  
  
CHORUS
