Welcome to my little world...completely self-contained, yeah  
Your problems they will soon be gone (we soak up lots of pain), yeah  
If life is a reflecting pool--then we are like a sponge, yeah  
Absorbing the good with the bad--we soak up...soak it up  
So give me all your troubled thoughts  
And baggage you can't handle, no  
We'll gladly take it off your back (we soak up lots of pain), yeah  
(Chorus)  
Is it any wonder now-everybody goes insane  
Everybody locks the door to keep out any strangers  
Everybody's all pent up--everybody's got short fuse  
Getting ready to blow up, we live in so much danger  
Boys and girls in a line -- Come and get your big reward  
Your're not too late Just in time  
Put your hand on mine you're mine you're mine  
When everybody has gone to bed--and children are asleep, yeah  
I sit up late and watch t.v. (and soak up lots of pain), yeah  
Little junior on the bus--his notebook by his side, yeah  
He hardly ever makes a fuss--he soaks up so much pain  
We've traveled far this monkey and me--by airplane boat and train, yeah  
We're here to eat up all your sins (and soak up all your pain), yeah  
(Chorus)  
Boys and girls of every creed--religion and persuasion, nooo  
It's time to get up off your knees...we soak up...soak it up  
So open the door and let me in--don't question who I am, no  
Just shake my hand and give me your name (we soak up...soak it up...)
