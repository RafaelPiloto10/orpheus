On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
It's what they're playing  
When the radio's on and you  
And me get crazy  
  
Hey, mister on the radio  
Please play my favorite song  
The one where she didn't go away  
Hey, mister on the radio  
You're really my best friend  
Please play my favorite song for me  
Hey, mister on the radio  
You're with me every day  
  
And late at night I turn you on  
On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
It's what they're playing  
When the radio's on and you  
And me get crazy  
All of the rock and roll dj's  
Got their fingers on the world  
'cause they play the songs  
That make you and me feel so good  
Turn up your radios  
And hear the music  
  
On the radio  
This song is playin'  
When the radio's on  
And you and me get crazy  
Radio DJ monologue  
  
One minute the back side of midnight it's me captain gonzo  
Ready to roll hot wax anything you want to hear  
All night its a balmy 73 degrees in fog city,  
71 in the valley 80 in Santa Cruz, but remember if you snooze you lose  
I'm gonna hang with you, I'll crank it on  
So let me know what you want to hear phone lines are open now  
You say it you know I'm gonna play it  
And be ready to win when I tell you to call in and whatever you do  
Remember the phrase that pays puts your brain on vacation  
And let your toes take over keep your pedal to the metal  
I'll be back in sixty seconds, in the meantime go with it,  
Go for it, go nuts, go completely wild
