I have been a rover I have walked alone  
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home  
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see  
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me  
There was a girl in Portland before the winter chill  
We used to go out courtin' along October Hill  
She could laugh away the dark clouds cry away the snow  
Seems like only yesterday down the road I go  
I have been a rover...  
There was a girl in Houston out where the hot winds blow  
Why I had to leave her God Almighty knows  
She could take the long hot summer cool it with a sigh  
Words have no more wisdom when it's time to say goodbye  
I have been a rover...
