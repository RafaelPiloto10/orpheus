I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside,  
I could lie to myself, but it's true  
There's no denying when I look in your eyes,  
Girl I'm out of my head over you  
And I lived so long believin' all love is blind  
But everything about you is tellin' me this time  
  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever  
  
I hear the echo of a promise I made  
When you're strong you can stand on your own  
But those words grow distant as I look at your face  
No, I don't want to go it alone  
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line  
But everything about you is tellin' me this time  
  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever - yeah!  
  
Oooh  
I see my future when I look in your eyes  
It took your love to make my heart come alive  
'Cause I lived my life believin' all love is blind  
But everything about you is tellin' me this time  
  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever  
  
Oooh  
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind  
Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever  
  
Yeah
