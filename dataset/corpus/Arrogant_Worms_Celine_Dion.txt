I think I've got a crush on Celine Dion  
The way she beats her chest when she sings a love song  
There's something about her makes me want to feed her  
And I'd love to be Mister Celine Dion  
She'll sing a song in English, and she'll sing en francais  
Both the songs will suck, but I love her anyway  
She's full of emotion, I'm full of devotion  
For Celine and I'll be hers someday  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
I sent you cards and letters, but you don't respond  
You play hard to get, but my heart goes on and on (and on and on, etc...)  
I just wanna say, je aimerez  
And I can see your house from my van  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
Celine Celine  
Her skin's so soft and clean  
Just like porcelain  
I wish she'd slather me  
With a tub of Vaseline  
(That was a little creepy) I'm sorry, Celine  
Celine Celine  
Celine Dion
