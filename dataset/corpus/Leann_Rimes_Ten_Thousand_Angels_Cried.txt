Stillness filled the heavens, on crucifixion day.  
Some say it rained, I don't know if it's true.  
Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels cried  
That would seem like rain to me and you.  
  
The angels all stood ready to take him from the tree  
They waited for the words from his voice.  
And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me.  
They watched the saviour die of his own choice.  
  
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry  
But I'm sure they did  
As they stood by  
And watched the saviour die.  
  
God turned his head away  
He couldn't bear the sight  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried.  
  
As the sun slipped away  
The skies turned to grey  
And when jesus gave his all  
That's when the tears began to fall  
  
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry  
But I'm sure they did  
As they stood by  
And watched the saviour die.  
  
God turned his head away  
He couldn't bear the sight  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried.  
  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried.
