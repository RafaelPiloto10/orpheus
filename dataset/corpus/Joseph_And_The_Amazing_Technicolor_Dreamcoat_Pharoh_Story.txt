Pharaoh he was a powerful man.  
With the ancient world in the palm of his hands.  
To all intents and purposes he,  
Was Egypt with a capital E.  
Whatever he did, he was showered with praise.  
If he cracked a joke, than you chortled for days.  
No one had rights or a vote but the king,  
Infact you might say he was fairly right wing.  
When pharoh's around, than you got down, on the ground.  
If you ever find yourself near ramases, get down on your knees.  
  
A pharoh story, a pharoh story.  
A pharoh story, a pharoh story.  
  
Down at the other end of the scale,  
Joseph is still spending time in jail.  
For even though he's in with the guards,  
A lifetime in prison seems quite in the cards.  
If my analysis of the position is right,  
At the end of the tunnel is a glimmer of light.  
Because of all sudden there's been visions and things.  
Disturbing the peace of both peasants and kings.  
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams.  
And a man who can interpret could go far,  
Could become a star.  
  
Could be famous, could be a big success,  
Could be famous, could be a big success.  
  
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams.  
And a man who can interpret could go far,  
Could become a star.  
  
Could be famous, could be a big success,  
Could be famous, could be a big success.  
  
[During the Could be famous...]A Star....  
  
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams.  
And a man who can interpret could go far,  
Could become a star.  
  
Could be famous, could be a big success,  
Could be famous, could be a big success.  
  
Could be a star!
