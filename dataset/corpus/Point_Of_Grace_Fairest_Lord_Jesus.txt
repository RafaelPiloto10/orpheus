Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature  
O Thou art God and man, the son  
Thee, will I cherish, Thee, will I honor  
Thou, my soul's only joy and Christ  
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands  
Mold in the blooming God of spring  
Jesus, Jesus is fairer, Jesus is pure  
Who makes the wrongful heart to, to see?  
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight  
And all that weakling, starry pose  
Oh Jesus, oh, my Jesus shines brighter  
Oh, my Jesus shines purer than all the angels Heaven can bolt out  
Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations  
Son of the God and Son of Man  
Glory and honor, praise, adoration  
Now and forevermore be thine  
Glory and honor, praise, adoration  
Now and forevermore be thine
