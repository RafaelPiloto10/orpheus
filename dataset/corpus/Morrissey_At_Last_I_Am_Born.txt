At last I am born  
Historians note  
I am finally born  
I once used to chase affection withdrawn  
But now I just sit back and yawn  
Because I am born, born, born  
Look at me now  
From difficult child to spectral hand to Claude Brasseur-oh-blah blah blah  
At last I am born  
Vulgarians know  
I am finally born  
I once thought that time accentuates despair  
But now I don't actually care  
Because I am born, born, born  
Look at me now  
From difficult child to spectral hand to Claude Brasseur-oh-blah blah blah  
At last I am born  
At last I am born  
Leaving the one true free life born  
I once thought I had numerous reasons to cry  
And I did, but I don't anymore  
Because I am born, born, born  
At last I am born  
At last I am born  
It took me a long, long time  
But now I am born  
I once was a mess of guilt because of the flesh  
It's remarkable what you can learn  
Once you are born, born, born  
Born, born, born  
Born, born, born
