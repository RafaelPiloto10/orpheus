Bow bells say goodbye to the last train  
Over the river they all go again  
Out into leafy nowhere hope someone  
Waiting out there for them  
Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun  
He works nights but it's not much fun  
Picks up the London yo-yo's, all on their own down Soho  
Please take me home  
  
Other people wouldn't want to hear you  
If you said that these are the best days of their lives  
Other people would turn around an d laugh at you  
If you said that these were the best days of our lives  
  
Trellick Tower's been calling  
I know she'll leave me in the morning  
  
In hotel cells listening to dial tones  
Remote controls and cable moans  
In his drink he's been talking  
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home
