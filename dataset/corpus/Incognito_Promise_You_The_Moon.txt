Shinin' like the noon day sun  
You gave me a fever  
Hypnotized under your spell  
Caught in a rapture  
  
There's no use in denyin'  
That much is true  
There's no other way to say it  
I'd die for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Whatever you desire  
Child?  
I give my all to you  
Tell me what you desire  
Oh child?  
I promise you the moon  
  
Late at night with Quincy and Gershwin  
It's stronger than ever  
This feeling inside  
When you're holdin' me baby  
  
So what's the use in denyin'  
You know that it is true  
There's no other way to say it (No)  
I love for you (Only you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no use in denyin'  
I'd die for you
