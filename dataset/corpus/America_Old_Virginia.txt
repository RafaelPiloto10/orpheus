Hey, honey, won't you sit down  
And stop here for a spell  
Singin' the sweet old lullabies  
To forget about your health  
Don't think about tomorrow  
It's a whole night's sleep away  
Sure would be pleased to have you stay  
And it's reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round tends to take away your smile  
'Pears to me it's all a body can do to stay in tune  
And you've been strainin' at those strings  
From mornin' till noon  
So come on down and hang around  
It'll put you right real soon  
'Cause nothing's changed  
It's all the same  
Reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round can take away your smile  
Reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round can take away your smile
