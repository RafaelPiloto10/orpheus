Good morning, I'm alone  
My joy's on the shelf  
Because my broken heart  
Can't mend more of itself  
  
Today your hope is gone  
He took it when he left  
Well, his promise to hold on  
Never could be kept  
  
So just pick up the phone  
And call me  
When you find yourself alone  
Just call me  
  
I love the way I find  
Your eyes to be so kind  
And it's funny how they seem  
To stare straight through me  
  
So if you wake up today  
Forgetting what you have  
And you find that you feel lost  
I'll be your ticket back  
  
Just pick up the phone  
And call me  
When you find yourself alone  
Just call me  
  
Just call me baby
