I don't know how to love you.  
Where do I begin.  
It helplessness is sinning  
Then here I am a sinner  
Guilty of sin.  
  
I don't know how to help you  
Your trouble goes so deep  
You're about to lose your life  
And here I am dejected  
Cause I love a night of sleep.  
  
Love one another you said  
Come together as one.  
I'm just a servant, Lord  
Yet you made me a son  
Sometimes I'm troubled  
By the things you make me see.  
But no matter how I feel, Lord  
Here am I send me.  
  
So I leave the world behind me  
And enter this domain.  
I'm staggered by the gulf  
Between us.  
I can see your sickness  
But I don't feel your pain.  
  
Pity's got no power  
Compassion has the heart  
Jesus, keep me mindful  
That it's you who does the  
Giving.  
And it's we who need to  
Play our part.
