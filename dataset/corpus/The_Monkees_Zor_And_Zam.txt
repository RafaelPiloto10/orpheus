By Bill Chadwick and John Chadwick  
The king of Zor, he called for war  
And the king of Zam, he answered.  
They fashioned their weapons one upon one  
Ton upon ton, they called for war at the rise of the sun.  
  
Out went the call to one and to all  
That echoed and rolled like the thunder.  
Trumpets and drums, roar upon roar  
More upon more.  
Rolling the call of "Come now to war."  
  
Throughout the night they fashioned their might  
With right on the side of the mighty.  
They puzzled their minds plan upon plan  
Man upon man  
And at dying of dawn the great war began.  
  
They met on the battlefield banner in hand.  
They looked out across the vacant land.  
And they counted the missing, one upon one,  
None upon none.  
The war it was over before it begun.  
  
Two little kings playing a game.  
They gave a war and nobody came.  
And nobody came.  
And nobody came.  
And nobody came.  
And nobody came.
