[Chorus]  
M I N I M A L  
Minimal (minimal), minimal (minimal)  
M I N I M A L  
Minimal (minimal), minimal  
  
White on white  
Light, sublime  
Subliminal  
The void is clean  
A cell, but not for a criminal  
  
Light and shade  
Time and space  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Draw a line  
More is less  
Is minimal  
The form of life  
Decide something less decisional (decisional)  
  
Light and shade  
Time and space  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Minimal, minimal)  
Void is clean  
  
An empty box  
An open space  
A single thought  
Leaves a trace  
  
An empty box  
An open space  
A single thought  
Leaves a trace  
  
Light (light), and shade (shade)  
Time (time) and space  
  
[Chorus: x2]
