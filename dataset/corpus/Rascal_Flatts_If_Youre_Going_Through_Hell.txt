Well you know those times  
When you feel like there's a sign there on your back  
Say's I don't mind if ya kick me  
Seems like everybody has  
Things go from bad to worse  
You'd think they can't get worse than that  
And then they do  
  
You step off the straight and narrow  
And you don't know where you are  
Use the needle of your compass  
To sew up your broken heart  
Ask directions from a genie  
In a bottle of Jim Beam  
And she lies to You  
That's when you learn the truth  
  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Well I been deep down in that darkness  
I been down to my last match  
Felt a hundred different demons  
Breathing fire in my back  
And I knew that if I stumbled  
I'd fall right into the trap that they were laying, Yeah  
  
But the good news  
Is there's angels everywhere out on the street  
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet  
The one's that you been dragging for so long  
You're on your knees  
You might as well be praying  
Guess what I'm saying  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Yeah, If you're going through hell  
Keep on moving, Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Yeah, If you're going through hell  
Keep on moving, Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
Yeah you might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
Yeah.
