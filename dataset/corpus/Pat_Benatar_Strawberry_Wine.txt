How am I supposed to make it through another day  
What am I supposed to do now that you've gone away  
Is there anything encouraging you can say to me  
Did you really think my heart was made of stone  
Maybe you never gave it any thought at all  
How nice to go through live oblivious and free  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  
How am I supposed to ever feel the same  
These kind of situations always have a way  
Of screwing up your mind and messing with your sanity  
How many days and nights will have to come and go  
Before I realize what I already know  
I'm better off without you like I thought I'd be  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  
(spoken) life is sweet  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience
