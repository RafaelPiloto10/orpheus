Love soft as an easy chair  
Love fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
  
You and I will make each night a first  
Every day a beginning  
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed  
They warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love  
  
Two lives that shine as one  
Morning glory and midnight sun  
Time we've learned to sail above  
Time won't change the meaning of one love  
Ageless and ever evergreen
