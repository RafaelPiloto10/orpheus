I gave up on you.  
And your exercise  
And the world that I knew  
Then, I fell back on you.  
Cause I need more time  
And I need an excuse  
  
I'm a thief, a liar  
An angel in the fire  
I'm a king, a drug  
The push that comes to shove  
I'm a freak, a star  
I'm everything you are  
I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride  
  
We're made to heal  
  
I depend on you  
For the wings of life  
And the air that you move  
And I defended you  
For this one last time  
For the nerves you abuse.  
  
I'm a thief, a liar  
An angel in the fire  
I'm a king, a drug  
The push that comes to shove  
I'm a freak, a star  
I'm everything you are  
I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride  
  
We're made to heal
