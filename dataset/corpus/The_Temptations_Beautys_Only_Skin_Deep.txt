So in love, sad as could be  
'Cause a pretty face got the best of me.  
Suddenly you came into my life  
And gave it meaning and pure delight.  
Now, good looks I've learned to do without  
'Cause now I know it's love that really counts  
I know beauty's only skin deep.  
Yeah yeah yeah.  
Beauty's only skin deep.  
Yeah yeah yeah,  
  
Now, you speak your words warm and sincere  
And let me know that your love is here.  
A pretty face you many not possess  
But what I like about you is your tenderness.  
A pretty face may be some guys taste  
But I'll take lovin' in its place,  
'Cause I know beauty's only skin deep.  
Yeah yeah yeah.  
Beauty's only skin deep.  
Yeah, yeah yeah.  
  
Now, friends ask what do I see in you.  
But it goes deeper than the eye can view.  
You have a pleasing personality  
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality.  
Now, show me a girl, a girl that's fine  
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' ev'ry time,  
'Cause I know beauty's only skin deep.  
Yeah yeah yeah.  
Beauty's only skin deep.  
Yeah yeah yeah.  
So if you're lookin' for a lover  
(Oh, yeah) don't judge a book by its cover.  
(Oh yeah) She may be fine on the outside  
(Oh yeah) but so untrue on the inside.
