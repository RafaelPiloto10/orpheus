If I'm not in love with you  
What is this I'm going through, tonight  
And if my heart is lying then  
What should I believe in  
Why do I go crazy  
Everytime I think about you baby  
Why else do I want you like I do  
If I'm not in love with you  
  
And if I don't need your touch  
Why do I miss you so much, tonight  
If it's just infatuation  
Why is my heart aching  
To hold you forever  
Give a part of me I thought I'd never  
Give again to someone I could lose  
If I'm not in love with you  
  
Oh why in every fantasy  
Do I feel your arms embracing me  
Like lovers lost in sweet desire  
And why in dreams do I surrender  
Like a little baby  
How do I explain this feeling  
Someone tell me  
  
If I'm not in love with you  
What is this I'm going through, tonight  
And if this heart is lying then  
What should I believe in  
Why do I go crazy  
Every time I think about you baby  
Why else do I want you like I do  
If I'm not in love with you
