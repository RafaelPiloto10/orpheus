I'm a million ages past you  
A million years behind you too  
A thousand miles up in the air  
A trillion times I've seen you there  
  
Your hair is golden, mine is grey  
You walk on grass, it turns to hay  
You blood is blue and mine is red  
My body strains, but the nerves are dead  
  
I can't reach you  
I've strained my eyes  
I can't reach you  
I've split my sides  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you  
  
The distances grow greater now  
You drink champagne and past me plow  
You fly your plane right over my head  
You're still alive and I'm nearly dead  
  
I can't reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I can't reach you  
I crane my neck  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you  
  
Once I caught a glimpse  
Of your unguarded, untouched heart  
Our fingertips touched and then  
My mind tore us apart  
  
I can't reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I can't reach you  
I crane my neck  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you  
  
I can't reach you  
With arms outstretched  
I can't reach you  
I crane my neck  
I can't reach  
Tryin' to get on you  
See, feel or hear from you
