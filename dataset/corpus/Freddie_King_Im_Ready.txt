I'm ready, ready as anybody can be  
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be  
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me  
  
I got an axe handle pistol built on a graveyard frame  
Shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain  
I'm drinkin' tnt, smokin' dynamite, I hope some screwball  
Start a fight  
  
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be  
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me  
  
All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little  
Hair,  
I know you think that I ain't nowhere  
But stop what your doin' an' look over here,  
I'll prove to ya, baby, that I ain't no square  
  
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be  
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me  
  
I been drinkin' gin like never before  
I feel so good, babe, I want you to know  
One more drink, and I wish you would  
I takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good, 'cause  
  
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be  
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me
