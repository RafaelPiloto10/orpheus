Here we go again, infatuation  
Touches me just when I  
Thought that it would end  
Oh but then again it seemed  
Much more than that but  
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking  
  
Well,I toss and turn all night  
Thinking of your ways of affection  
But to find that it's not different at all  
Well I throw away my past mistakes  
And contemplate my future  
That's when I say, what the hey  
  
Would it last forever?  
You and I together, hand and hand  
We run away, far away  
I'll beat that nasty weather  
But I'll take whatever you can  
Give that comes my way, yeah, far away
