Various dates)  
  
Something to remember me by  
Something freezing your hand  
Something so you feel all grown up when you call my name  
  
Oh, I'm falling down...  
Oh, I'm falling...  
I don't know when I'll be up  
  
When I call, please remember  
Frozen like stone, yeah  
He's only flesh and blood  
I'll be gone, yeah...  
Just a memory passing like pages in a book  
  
I'm falling down...  
I'm falling... (2x)  
I don't know if I'll get up  
You're a boy... (3x)  
  
I know why you're here  
Can't guess your side  
Oh no, the cry of a newborn child  
Can't feel the heat  
Of something fresh  
Can somebody hide me  
I cannot hold on... (2x)  
I cannot hold on, child
