I've traveled far, the land and the sea  
Beautiful places I happened to be  
One little town I'll never forget  
Is Lourdes, the village of St. Bernadette  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia  
  
There, like a dream, this wonderful night  
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light  
A feeling divine swept over me there  
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia  
  
Now I am home, I'm happy to be  
Telling of places I've traveled to see  
One little town I'll never forget  
Is Lourdes, the village of St. Bernadette  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-i-ia  
  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a  
Ave, ave, ave Ma-ri-a
