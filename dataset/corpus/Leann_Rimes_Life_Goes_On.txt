You sucked me in and played my mind  
Just like a toy  
You would crank and wind  
Baby, I would give you to what you want  
You left me lying in a pool of doubt  
If you're still thinking your the daddy mack  
Ya shouldn't known better  
But ya didn't  
And I can't go back  
  
Oh life goes on  
And it's only gonna make me strong  
It's a fact  
Once you get on board  
Say good-bye  
'Cause you can't go back  
Oh it's a fight  
And I really want to get it right  
Where I'm at  
It's my life before me  
Got this feeling  
That I can't go back  
  
Wish I knew then what I know now  
You held all the cards  
And sold me out  
Baby, shame on you if you fool me once  
Shame on me if you fool me twice  
You've been a pretty hard case to crack  
Should've of known better  
But I didn't  
And I can't go back  
  
Oh life goes on  
And it's only gonna make me strong  
It's a fact  
Once you get on board  
Say good-bye  
'Cause you can't go back  
Oh it's a fight  
And I really want to get it right  
Where I'm at  
It's my life before me  
Got this feeling  
That I can't go back  
  
Na na na na life goes on  
Na na na na made me strong  
  
Oh oh yea  
  
Got a feeling that I can't go back  
  
Life, goes, on  
  
On yea,  
Life  
Goes  
On and on and on  
  
Shame on you if you fool me once  
Shame on me if you fool me twice  
You've been a pretty hard case to crack  
I should of known better  
But I didn't  
And I can't go back  
  
Oh life goes on  
And it's only gonna make me strong  
It's a fact  
Once you get on board  
Say good-bye  
'Cause you can't go back  
Oh it's a fight  
And I really want to get it right  
Where I'm at  
It's my life before me  
Got this feeling  
That I can't go back  
  
Na na na na life goes on  
Na na na na made me strong  
  
Oh oh yea
