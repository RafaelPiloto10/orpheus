I been trying a long, long time  
To write a love letter, perfect lines  
What I want to say is hard to find  
No cliches or tired rhymes  
But words turn on me hard as I try  
Your look of love, I can't describe  
I'll use the language of love  
The language of love  
You'll understand what I say  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  
Bad, bad heartaches when I'm alone  
Fighting with feelings I've never known  
Scared and lonely, half gone mad  
'Coz I need what I just can't have  
I write a love letter like a kiss in the night  
Wanna tell it to you just right  
I'll use the language of love  
The language of love  
You'll understand what I say  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  
I need love so very bad  
You are the best I've ever had  
I need to say, I need to show  
In the way only lovers know  
I'll use the language of love  
The language of love  
You'll understand what I say  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  
Use the language of love  
Language of love  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way
