Hanging out on Second Avenue  
Eating chicken vindaloo  
I just want to be with you  
I just want to have something to do  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, well alright!  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Wait! Now!  
Wait! Now!  
  
Hanging out all by myself  
I don't want to be with anybody else  
I just want to be with you  
I just want to have something to do  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, well alright!  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Wait! Now!  
Wait! Now!  
Wait! Now!  
Wait! Now!  
  
Hanging out all by myself  
I don't want to be with anybody else  
I just want to be with you  
I just want to have something to do  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, well alright!  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight
