You did it 'cause you wanted  
Alibi, alibi  
And you took it  
Cause you need it  
Alibi, alibi  
  
But if I've done something wrong there's no "ifs and buts"  
'Cause I love you just as much as I hate your guts  
Alibi, alibi, alibi...  
  
[Chorus:]  
And you don't need anybody  
Alibi, alibi  
But you are the only one that knows this  
Alibi, alibi  
You deserve it 'cause you're special  
Alibi, alibi  
Maybe Jesus wants you for a sunbeam  
Alibi, alibi  
  
But if I've left something out  
I apologize  
But if you look in my eyes  
Then I'm sure you'll see...  
Alibis, alibis, alibis...  
  
Sometimes I'm so forgiving  
Everything seems bad to me  
But I can't go on living  
With this alibi, alibi, alibi...  
  
"Insane," what a mundane  
Alibi, alibi  
And you only wanted to be famous  
Alibi, alibi  
Sorry, but your mommy doesn't love you  
Alibi, alibi  
Stop me if you've heard this...  
Alibi, alibi  
  
But if I've done something right then don't be surprised  
There are soldiers who will kill but refuse to die  
  
But if I've done something wrong there's no "ifs and buts"  
'Cause I love you just as much as I hate your guts  
Alibi, alibi, alibi, alibi...  
  
You were weak...  
You couldn't help it  
Alibi, alibi  
But you never had a pony  
Alibi, alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you're such a people person  
Alibi, alibi  
And I will be true to you forever  
Alibi, alibi  
But you're stupid and you're lazy  
Alibi, alibi  
Maybe we can make the future better  
Alibi, alibi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I'm so forgiving  
Everything seems bad to me  
But I can't go on living  
With this alibi, alibi, alibi...  
  
You were happy when you were poor  
And more honest and that's your...  
Alibi, alibi  
Sister is a whore, brother isn't sure  
Alibi, alibi  
You don't fit the body that you're trapped in  
Alibi, alibi  
Papa's got a brand new...  
Alibi, alibi  
  
But if I've done something wrong there's no "ifs and buts"  
'Cause I love you just as much as I hate your guts  
But if I've left something out  
I apologize  
But if you look in my eyes  
Then I'm sure you'll see...  
Alibis, alibis, alibis...
