I won't say anything  
I'm hiding in the pink  
If I move would I break the spell  
Or am I boring you  
  
I can't feel anything  
I think whatever you say  
You took me riding on the big wheel  
So I guess I'm happy now  
  
And I'll stay with you  
And I'll lay with you  
And I'll always be there  
Nothing will go wrong  
Till something better comes along  
  
So now you swallowed me  
Come and finish off the rest of me  
A good house a cactus life  
Spent perfect days and sleepless nights whatever  
  
And I'll stay with you  
And I'll lay with you  
And I'll always be there  
Nothing will go wrong  
Till something better comes along  
  
And I 've lost my fingerprints  
And I 've lost my sixth sense  
But you just don't feel a thing  
When the needles going in  
  
And I'll stay with you  
And I'll lay with you  
And I'll always be there  
Oh go nowhere  
And I'll stay with you  
Till something better comes along....  
  
So now you swallowed me  
Come and finish off the rest of me
