Promises made  
Promises broken  
Measures of our demise  
Secrets of souls that  
Rarely get spoken  
Pleasure's a thin disguise.  
  
Dozens of ways  
Dozens of reasons  
Shielding our hearts from pain  
Riddles of romance  
That distance may yet explain.  
  
Certain of nothing  
So fearful of love  
Nobody seems to show you enough  
Over and over  
The scenes are replayed  
And once again  
Those promises made.  
  
Feeling forsaken  
Broken in two  
How did this ever happen to you?  
Taken for granted  
Bruised and betrayed  
Lonely survivors  
These promises made.  
  
Dozens of ways  
Dozens of reasons  
Shielding our hearts from pain  
Riddles of romance  
That distance may yet explain.  
  
Certain of nothing  
You're so damn fearful of love  
Nobody seems to show you enough  
Over and over  
The scenes are replayed  
And once again  
Those promises made.
