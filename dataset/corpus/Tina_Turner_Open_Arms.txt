Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
Come to me when you're down  
I'll give you friendly advice  
I'll be your avenue, your trusting ear  
Release your deepest secrets  
I'll be sincere  
  
It's an age old situation  
There's nothing to fear  
Whatever life throws at you  
Your friend is here  
Right by your side  
  
When love leaves you cold  
Lies have been told  
I will be there with my open arms  
Hurting inside  
Please don't hide the pain  
I will be there with my open arms  
  
I know what you're saying  
I been there myself  
Promises withstand  
They left me for someone else  
Then the tables turn  
A lesson I had to learn  
I can't put my fingers 'cause  
Girls, my fingers have been burned  
  
It's an age old situation  
The message is clear  
Whatever life throws at you  
Your friend is here  
Right by your side
