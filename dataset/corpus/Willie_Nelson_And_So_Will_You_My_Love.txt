The music's stopped, the crowd is thinnin' now.  
One phase of night has reached an ending now.  
And nothin', nothin' lasts forever,  
Except forever, and you, my love.  
  
And so will you, my love:  
My love.  
  
The street is dark here while I walk alone,  
An' since you've gone, I always walk alone.  
'Cause nothin', nothin' lasts forever,  
Except forever, and you, my love.  
  
And so will you, my love:  
My love.  
  
And so will you, my love:  
Your memories always near.  
Wherever I am found,  
Your memories still around.  
  
The dawn an' I arrive at home at last.  
Night turns it's lonely face toward the past.  
'Cause nothin', nothin' lasts forever,  
Except forever, and you, my love.  
  
And so will you, my love:  
My love.
