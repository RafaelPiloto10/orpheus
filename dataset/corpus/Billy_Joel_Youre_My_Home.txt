When you look into my eyes  
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul  
It always comes as a surprise  
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow  
  
Well I never had a place  
That I could call my very own  
But that's all right my love  
'Cause you're my home.  
  
When you touch my weary head  
And you tell me everything will be all right  
You say use my body for your bed  
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night  
  
Well I'll never be a stranger  
And I'll never be alone  
Wherever we're together  
That's my home.  
  
Home could be the Pennsylvania turnpike  
Indiana's early morning dew  
High up in the hills of California  
Home is just another word for you  
  
Well I never had a place that I could call my very own  
But that's all right my love 'cause you're my home  
  
If I travel all my life  
And I never get stop and settle down  
Long as I have you by my side  
There's a roof above and good walls all around  
You're my castle, you're my cabin  
And my instant pleasure dome  
I need you in my house  
'Cause you're my home,  
You're my home.
