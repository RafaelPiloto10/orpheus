When I first saw you baby  
You took my breath away,  
I knew your name was Trouble  
But, my heart got in the way  
I couldn't stop myself from reaching out,  
I could not turn away  
  
I don't even know your name  
An' I can't leave you alone,  
I'm running round in circles  
Like a dog without a bone  
I know the game you're playing  
But, baby I just can't let go  
  
So give me all your love tonight,  
Give me all your love tonight  
I'll do anything you want  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
I'll work hard everyday  
To love and treat you right.  
I'll rock you in the morning  
And roll you in the night.  
Any way you want  
I'm gonna prove my love for you.  
  
So give me all your love tonight,  
Give me all your love tonight  
I'll do anything you want,  
Just give me all of your loving tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
So give me all your love tonight,  
Give me all your love tonight  
I'll do anything you want,  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
So give me all your love tonight,  
Give me all your love tonight  
I'll do anything you want,  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
I am blinded by your smile  
And I'm crazy about your walk  
I shiver and I shake  
When I hear you baby talk  
I'm a fool for your loving babe,  
Give me all your loving tonight  
  
So give me all your love tonight,  
Give me all your love tonight  
I'll do anything you want,  
Just give me all of your loving tonight  
  
Anything you want from me  
  
So give me all your love tonight,  
Give me all your love tonight  
I'll do anything you want,  
Just give me all of your loving tonight, tonight, tonight
