[Chorus]  
I'm a one man woman  
I want a one woman man  
I've got two arms to hold him  
To love him all I can  
Now it's a free world we live in  
It's this I understand  
  
But I'm a one man woman  
I want a one woman man  
I don't need nobody  
  
Handing me those lines  
Saying I can keep my freedom  
In these modern times  
  
I want a ring on my finger  
For all the world to see  
And when I get home from working  
He'll be waiting here for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want nobody  
Pulling me around  
Loving me then leaving  
For someone else downtown  
If he ain't true and steady  
Then he ain't in my plans  
Cause I'm a one man woman  
I want a one woman man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause I'm a one man woman  
I want a one woman man
