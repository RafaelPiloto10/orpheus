Gonna save you fucker,.not gonna lose you  
Feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go,  
Too important to me  
  
Too important to us, we'd be lost without you  
Baby, let yourself fall, I'm right below you now  
  
And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear  
And fuck if you only hear what you want to hear  
Fuck me if I care, but I'm not leaving here  
  
You helped me when I was down, I'll help when you're down  
Why are you hitting yourself, c'mon hit me instead  
  
Let's pick up your will, it's grown fat and lazy  
I'm sympathetic as well, don't go on me now  
  
And I'm not living this life without you, I'm selfist and clear  
And you're not leaving here without me, I don't want to be without  
My best friend, wake up to see you could have it all  
  
Cause there is but you, and something within you  
It's taken control, let's beat it, get up let's go  
  
Oh you're in your own world, let's see the whole world  
Let's pick up your soul  
  
And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear  
And fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head  
Please help, me, to help you, help yourself  
  
Help me help yourself, please want me to, please let me to  
  
Help you
