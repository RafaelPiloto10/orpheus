On the stairs she sits and waits  
She's crying out but nobody even cares  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Holding in the hurt and pain  
Looking for love to come pull her from this place  
(Pull her from this place)  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence  
  
Sometimes we're loudest when  
The doors are shut and no one can see our face  
(No one can see our face)  
But it seems we're quiet when  
Someone needs a touch of heaven's grace, oh yeah  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence  
  
We are all God's children  
We need to count off all we've been given, oh yeah  
We are all God's children  
We need to tell off all we've been given, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay  
I'm not gonna walk away  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence, yeah, in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence
