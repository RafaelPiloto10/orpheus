Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  
  
When you dance with me we dance forever  
All night long to your favourite  
  
Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio  
  
When you dance with me we dance forever  
All night long to the latest song  
Live a lie, dance together  
All night long to your favourite  
  
Hit music  
Hit music  
  
I've been working hard all day  
To pay the bills I have to pay  
Don't have the strength to work all night  
Or fight until it's almost light  
  
Music on the radio  
The dance music at the disco  
  
Live a lie dance together  
All night long to your favourite song  
Live and die, it's all that we know  
I need a friend at the journey's end  
  
Hit music, in stereo  
  
It's all I've brought, but it's about forgetting  
Choose a song when the night's too long  
We all need love and we want protection  
I need a friend at the journey's end  
In Kensington, or Spanish Harlem  
All night long to your desperate  
  
Hit music on the radio  
Music at the disco  
Hit music on the radio  
Hit music on the radio
