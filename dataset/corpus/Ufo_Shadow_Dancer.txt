I am back in the circus  
Oh hustling days  
I look at the world  
In a rose coloured haze  
Cramp tight bodies  
Jive and girate  
Bump and grind to the rhythm of fate  
And we spun in the sunlight  
Of our long summers day  
We kissed the heavens now  
It's still a beautiful day  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world  
  
Married a model  
From old Hong Kong  
Came to England  
Just a singing my song  
This love in a letter  
Sure didn't last  
Stamped her passport  
Never saw her arse  
  
And we spun in the sunlight  
Of our long summers day  
We kissed the heavens now  
It's still a beautiful day  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world  
Solo  
Unlucky in life,  
Unlucky in love  
No special blessing from above  
Fools and horses  
Come to my door  
I am the stranger  
Who sleeps on the floor  
  
We spun in the sunlight  
Of our long summers day  
We kissed the heavens now  
It's still a beautiful day  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world  
  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
My hammer headed friends  
And the puppet girls call  
Back on my wall  
Shadow dancer  
The dance is coming back,  
Back in my world
