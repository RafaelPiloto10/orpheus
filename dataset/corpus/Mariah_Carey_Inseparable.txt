Call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
I be waitin' to hear your ring tone  
Call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
Baby call my phone  
I be waitin' to hear your ring tone  
  
Lost without my other  
Half thought can I live with out you  
I don't want another  
That's why I'm messed up about you  
  
Can't even dream with out seeing you  
Why should I even try to breathe  
And everything is off, without you  
Guess it's all my fault, ladies sing the blues  
  
No one could deny it  
We were flying like United  
Thought we'd never be divided  
Cause the love we had inside us was  
  
[Chorus]  
Inseparable  
If you open this song  
And you're searching for the moment when two hearts went wrong  
Inseparable  
And jealous was your work  
Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up  
Cause you'd thought that ya'll was  
Inseparable  
Thou we stay together  
Always and forever  
But now I see that no one is  
Inseparable  
Except for us  
One of us just got to pick the phone up  
Cause I know we're still  
Inseparable  
  
Got photos of us on my refrigerator  
Videos on my phone, why can't I just erase them  
The first text I ever got from you still saved in my inbox  
And I read it like time after time  
  
Boy I'm lost, can't you look, won't you please find me  
I'm down to my last tick, come rescue me  
See it's broken my heart, to the point where I don't need, to have a reason
now  
Weak now cause I just ain't the same with out you  
Boy I know we're  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's been sixteen days since I held you tight  
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night  
Boy I just wish you show up and make everything alright  
So what you waiting for?  
Cause both us have thought of we're  
  
[Chorus]
