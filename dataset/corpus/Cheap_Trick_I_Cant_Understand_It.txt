Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Back against the wall  
But you know the weekend's on it's way  
Waiting for the fall  
But you know the weekend's on it's way  
  
I got my eyes on you  
I see some trouble comin' into view  
Don't you know that I'm doin' alright on my own  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh  
I can't understand it  
What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Walking down the hall please stop in anytime of day  
Let's do more than talk  
About the weekend games we play  
  
I set my sights on you  
Let's make tonight a deep interview  
Don't you know that I'm doin' alright on my own  
  
I ain't out to destroy you, oh  
I'm comin' out to enjoy you, oh  
It's just a case of paranoia in my brain  
  
I've got my eyes on you  
I've got my gun loaded just for two  
If you knew my feelings  
I'm tellin' the truth  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh  
I can't understand it  
What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh  
I can't understand it  
What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I can't understand it  
What's a matter with you oh oh  
I can't understand it  
What's a poor man to do, oh oh oh oh oh
