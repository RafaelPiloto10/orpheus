When the TV won't work and your toys fall apart  
And you have a sad feeling deep in your heart  
You want to go out but it's rainin' out there I want you to know I care  
I care I do there's no one like you  
  
When they take you some place and you sit in a chair I want you to know I care  
When you tell a big lie and your parents're mean  
When being grownup is a faraway dream  
When you're fillin' your teeth and cuttin' your hair I want you to know I care  
  
I care I do there's no one like you  
I mention your name when I'm sayin' my prayers I want you to know I care  
When you have a bad cough and you can't go out  
When you sit for a week with that thing in your mouth  
  
When you sleep in the dark and there's something out there I want you to know
I care  
I care I do there's no one like you and sometimes I act like a grouchy old
bear  
I want you to know I care I love you too much
