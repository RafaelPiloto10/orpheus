Fast approaching monsters marching in a row  
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory won't hold  
Run, darling, run  
I'll stall them if I can  
You'll escape, and I'll be left rotting on the vine  
  
Run, darling, run  
I'll stall if I can  
You'll escape, and I'll be left rotting on the vine  
Avert the children's eyes  
Forgets left untold  
Don't look back to see  
The blood river in the road  
  
Get sweet revenge with my blood river in the road
