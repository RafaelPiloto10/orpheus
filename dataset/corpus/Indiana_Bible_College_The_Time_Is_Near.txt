Verse 1  
The time is near  
When Christ shall appear  
To take us home  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
The time is drawing near  
  
Chorus  
Keep in the narrow way  
You've go to watch and pray  
In His presence you must stay  
He's coming soon  
Soon one day  
He's coming soon one day  
  
Verse 2  
No one knows the day or the hour  
When the Son of man shall come  
But I know that when He appears  
We shall, we shall be caught up to  
Meet Him in the air  
  
Bridge  
We're gonna be caught up (repeat)  
To meet Him in the air  
  
(Alto)  
You better get ready, He's coming back again  
(Tenor)  
Better get ready, ready, back again  
(Soprano)  
My Lord's coming, coming back again  
The time is drawing near
