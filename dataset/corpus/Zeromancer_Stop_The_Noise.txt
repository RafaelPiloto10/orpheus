Stop the noise!  
Stop the noise, man!  
  
Burns like hell  
Melt in your mouth  
Twist and turn you  
Into something else  
  
Pinch yourself  
Taste so sweet  
Twist and turn you  
Into something cheap  
  
And all you want to do now  
Yeah Yeah  
And all you want to do now  
  
Stop the noise!  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only in America  
Stop the noise!  
What you see can not be yours  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only in America  
  
Breathing hurts  
Swallowing words  
It can't  
It can't get much worse  
  
Bleed you dry  
Against your will  
Think you're running  
But you're standing still  
  
It's all you want to do now  
Yeah Yeah  
It's all you want to do now  
  
Stop the noise!  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only in America  
Stop the noise!  
What you see can not be yours  
You gotta stop the noise, man!  
Only if you  
Make it go away
