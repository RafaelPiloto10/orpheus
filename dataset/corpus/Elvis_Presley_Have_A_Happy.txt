Now once it was told to me  
We're born with a magic key  
It opens the door to miracles of spring  
  
It takes you to wishing wells  
To ice cream and carousels  
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing  
  
Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy  
Have a happy, warm smiling face  
I start believin', in believin'  
Let your address, be sunshine place  
  
There's love and there's joy I'm told  
Much more than your heart can hold  
It's there like the ring you would grab  
On a merry-go-round  
  
The world isn't half as gray  
With friends on a rainy day  
But people keep away, when you wear a frown  
  
Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy  
Have a happy, warm smiling face  
I start believin', in believin'  
Let your address, be sunshine place
