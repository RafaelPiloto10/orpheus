Writhing and screaming the pain just won't go away  
He'll show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands it's useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
Tortured and flaming you give birth to hell  
Living a nightmare  
It's a pity you'll pray for your death  
But he's in no hurry  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
No where to run, your fate is in his hands  
Your time had come, you'll live to his command  
I'm warning you, the worst is yet to come  
The killer who, remains a mystery  
  
I that believe in the stories of old, would never  
Fight it  
Demons and curses that play on your soul  
Like something ignited  
  
You never imagined such a fate could follow you  
(You never thought it was true)  
And when it's your time I wonder how you'll do  
Your kind of troubles running deeper than the sea  
You broke the rules  
You've been a fool  
The little doll is you yeah  
  
No where to run, your fate is in his hands  
Your time had come, you'll live to his command  
I'm warning you, the worst is yet to come  
The killer who, remains a mystery  
  
Writhing and screaming the pain just won't go away  
He'll show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands it's useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
No where to run, your fate is in his hands  
Your time had come, you'll live to his command  
I'm warning you, the worst is yet to come  
The killer who, remains a mystery
