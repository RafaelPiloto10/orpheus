If you read in the paper that I went away  
Would it make any difference to you?  
If I packed my things and left town today  
Would it make any difference to you?  
  
Do you, do you even know?  
Do you even know that I'm still alive?  
  
Oh, I wonder  
I wonder if I ever, oh, cross  
If I ever cross your sweet mind  
  
If I got in, if I got into trouble  
Would I send for you?  
Would you come, would you come  
Or would you stay away?  
  
If we never love again  
Like we used to do  
Would it make, oh  
Would it make any difference to you?
