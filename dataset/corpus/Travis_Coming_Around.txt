Never see you coming around  
They know they got their heads screwed on  
I'm standing in the middle of town  
I know I might never come home  
Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me  
The sound of all these passers-by mixed in with the bus and motor-car  
I must be sure these are the signs  
Cause I've been here a million times before  
  
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around  
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down  
Bringing you round  
  
Tell me if I'm bringing you down  
Cause I was fine till you came along  
You tell me that the tears of a clown cloud  
That I'm confusing while abusing my mind  
So far away I wanna be  
That's not as close to you and me  
The things they call our destiny  
Now why do you have to pick on me at all?  
My walls are coming down  
  
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around  
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down  
Coming around
