Stinky soul get a little lost in my own  
Hey General, need a little love in that hole of yours  
One ways, now, and Saturdays and our kittens all wrapped in cement  
From cradle to gundrops  
Got me running girl fast as I can  
And is it right Butterfly they like you better framed and dried  
  
Daddy dear if I can kill one man why not two  
Well, nurses smile when you got iron veins  
You can't stain their pretty shoes and pom poms and cherry blondes  
And their kittens still wrapped in cement  
From God's saviors to gundrops  
Got me running girl as fast as I can  
And is it right Butterfly they like you better framed and dried  
  
Got a pretty pretty garden pretty garden yes  
Got me a pretty pretty garden a pretty garden yes  
Got me a pretty pretty garden a pretty garden
