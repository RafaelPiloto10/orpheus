Can't eat, can't sleep, can't seem to find time anymore  
Somewhere she weeps, her hair gently brushes the floor  
I know my way, I know that I'll find her somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
Angela carries me back to the time  
When I knew that her love was still mine  
Angela's holding the child in her womb  
And I pray that she will be calling soon  
  
Cold moon, dark sky, I'm watching my mind disappear  
She sits alone, not knowing that I am so near  
Why can't she hear my voice as I call out her name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a silly situation, it's just infatuation, no need to be sorry  
  
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't seem to find time anymore  
Somewhere she weeps, her hair gently brushes the floor  
I know my way, I know that I'll find her somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a silly situation, it's just infatuation, no need to be sorry
