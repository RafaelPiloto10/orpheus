I will live my life as a lobsterman's wife  
On an island in the blue bay  
He will take care of me, he will smell like the sea  
And close to my heart he'll always stay  
  
I will bear three girls all with strawberry curls  
Little Ella and Nelly and Faye  
While I'm combing their hair, I will catch his warm stare  
On our island in the blue bay  
  
Far away, far away, I want to go far away  
To a new life on a new shore line  
Where the water is blue and the people are new  
To another island, in another life  
  
There's a boy next to me and he never will be  
Anything but a boy at the bar  
And I think he's the tops, he's where everything stops  
How I love to love him from afar  
  
When he walks right past me  
Then I finally see on this bar stool I can't stay  
So I'm taking my frown to a far distant town  
On an island in the blue bay  
  
Far away, far away, I want to go far away  
To a new life on a new shore line  
Where the water is blue and the people are new  
To another island, in another life  
  
If I wanna go far away, away, away  
I wanna go far away, away, away  
I wanna go far away, away  
  
Where the water is blue and the people are new  
To another life, to another life  
To another shore line, in another life
