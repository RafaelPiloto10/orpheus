In a smoky room  
Could have been a devil's tomb  
90 miles east of LA  
  
Feeling desperate and cold  
Barely 19 years old  
Searching for the light in the pouring rain  
  
I visualize the cold reality  
If I don't try, the answer dies inside of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Blind faith takes me to the mountains  
Blind faith lead me to the sea  
Blind faith takes me to a higher ground  
Come on, come on, come on, and help me find my way  
  
In a small town school  
Caught between the liars and fools  
She spent her days thinking about her life  
  
She was full of dreams and doubts  
searching for that one way out  
Didn't want to spend the rest of her days being a small town wife  
  
She could visualize the life she wants to lead  
But deep inside, she didn't have the heart it takes to leave  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just got to get myself out of here  
We visualize the life we want to lead  
But deep inside got to find a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]
