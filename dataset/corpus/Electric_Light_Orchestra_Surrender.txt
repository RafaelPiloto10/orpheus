Baby, can you hear me call?  
Is it alright, now your back?s against the wall?  
Baby, is it still the same?  
Do you wonder? Is it on and back again?  
  
[Chorus]  
Surrender, baby, surrender  
Surrender, baby, surrender  
  
I know it, what we said that day  
Are you under? Did it matter anyway?  
You told me, what you said is true  
Does it all mean waiting back alone and blue?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Baby, can you hear me call?  
Is it alright, now your back?s against the wall?  
Baby, is it still the same?  
Do you wonder? Is it on and back again?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Surrender
