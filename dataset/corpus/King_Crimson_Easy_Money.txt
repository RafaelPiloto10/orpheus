Your admirers on the street  
Gotta hoot and stamp their feet  
In the heat from your physique  
As you twinkle by mocassin sneakers  
  
And I thought my heart would break  
When you doubled up the stake  
With your fingers all a shake  
You could never tell a winner from a snake  
But you always make money  
  
Easy Money  
With your figure and your face  
Strutting out at every race  
Throw a glass around the place  
Show the colour of your crimson suspenders  
  
We would take the money home  
Sit around the family throne  
My old dog could chew his bone  
For two weeks we could appease the Almighty  
  
Easy Money  
Got to truck with the la-di-da  
Keep my bread in an old fruit jar  
Drive you out in a motor-car  
Getting fat on your lucky star just making  
  
Easy Money
