Oh, Mars-1 Juxtapose  
Swine flu Sally's  
Neon nose grows  
Like a lifelike Pinocchio  
  
Everybody now is just trying to avoid it  
Newsman Tom is trying to exploit it  
I know a cure to stop the fear and a little rock'n'roll  
  
Primitive minds during primitive times  
But Dr. Lady Richard who won a Nobel Prize  
With a putridish smile  
  
What to do about third world nutrition  
Can we dismantle our stupid vision  
And get on with the show?  
  
Dare, dare if you dare  
Dare to be something  
Dare to be real  
Dare, dare to be more  
Hope for the better  
Dare to believe  
  
It's hard to make amends  
When you're sitting there on the fence  
Let the proof be in the pudding, sugar  
Everybody wants to start a new religion  
Please relax don't need a soul collision  
There's a dusty rose where the promise of love used to be  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Dare, dare if you dare  
Dare to be something  
Dare to be real  
Dare, dare to be more  
Hope for the better  
Dare to believe  
  
Dare if you dare  
If you dare  
If you dare  
If you dare  
  
My brother died and brought us together  
I hope it lasts and lasts forever  
What a hero he turned out to be  
I wish he could just believe  
  
Dare, dare if you dare  
Dare to be something  
Dare to be real  
Dare, dare to be more  
Hope for the better  
Dare to believe  
  
Dare if you dare  
If you dare  
If you dare  
If you dare
