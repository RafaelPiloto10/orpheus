You know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
She's out on her own, forever  
She's programmed to work hard, she's never profane  
She won't go insane, not ever  
No v.d., no cancer, on TV's the answer  
No father, no mother,, she's just like the other  
And you know and I know, my clone sleeps alone  
  
Your clone loves my clone, but yours cannot see  
That's no way to be, in heaven  
No sorrow, no heartache, just clone harmony  
So obviously, it's heaven  
  
No naughty clone ladies allowed in the eighties  
No bed names, no sex games, just clone names and clone games  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
  
Before we existed the cloning began  
The cloning of man and woman  
When we're gone they'll live on, cloned endlessly  
It's mandatory in heaven  
  
But they won't remember or ever be tender  
No loving, no caring, no program for pairing  
No v.d., no cancer, on Tv's the answer  
No father, no mother, she's just like the other  
  
No naughty clone ladies allowed in the eighties  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
My clone sleeps alone!  
My clone sleeps alone!
