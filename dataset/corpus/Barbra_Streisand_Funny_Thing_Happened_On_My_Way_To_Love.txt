You don't have to shout,  
From now on, I'm out of the kitchen.  
What's more, I can't stand your cigarette brand,  
And I'm switchen'.  
I'm unhappy with things the way that they've occured.  
It is time to face facts and not mince a word.  
Certain parties with bird-brains are getting the bird.  
Au revior, fare-thee-well and goodbye. And I'll tell you why.  
  
A funny thing happened on my way to love.  
I lost the young fella I've been dreaming of.  
He changed while I waited and hoped for his call,  
To someone who's no fun at all.  
Well, I've stopped forgetting, what else can I do?  
And much thanks for letting me practise on you.  
It's farewell my lovely, excuse, please, my dust.  
Unravel and travel I must.  
No tears, no hurt surprise,  
It's with a pleasant glow I realise.  
If I have that much love so deep, true and strong.  
All ready to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong.  
Then think of the treasures, the joy and delight,  
I'll give to my own Mr. Right.  
My own Mr. Right.  
So asta la vista, ta-ta, toodle-oo,  
The world will keep turning but not around you.  
There's someone else waiting that's more than a friend.  
Best wishes and dishes I'll send.  
And so, so-long, I'm on my way.  
Thanks for the buggy-ride and may I say -  
If I have that much love so deep true and strong.  
Already to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong.  
Then think of the treasures, the joy and delight,  
I'll give, as long as I live, at night,  
To my own Mr. Right.
