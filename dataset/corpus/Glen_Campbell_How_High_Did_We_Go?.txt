I have to admit  
That no-one could love me like you did  
And there were more laughs  
Than tears any day  
Like children at play  
But somewhere and somehow  
We lost each other  
  
How high did we go-o  
When we loved each o-other  
How high did we go-o  
When we said we care-hare-are-hared  
For the first time I'm scare-ared  
  
I have no regrets  
Lookin' back  
I hold nothi-ing against you  
'Cause I learned to love  
And that's more than most ever know-ow-ow  
And I just can't belie-ieve  
That we've lost each other  
  
How high did we go-o  
When we loved each o-other  
How high did we go-o  
When we said we care-hare-are-hare-ared  
For the first time I'm scare-ared  
  
How high did we go-o-ho-ho  
When we loved each o-other  
How high did we go-o  
When we said we care-hare-are-hared
