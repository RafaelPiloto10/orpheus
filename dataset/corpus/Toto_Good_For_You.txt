If you're dreamin', son don't you rise  
I never get lost, so deep into us  
I won't give up until you give in, but I know you must realize  
  
[Chorus:]  
I could be good for you, you could be good for me too, yeah  
I could be good for you, you could be good for me too  
  
Everyone knows, but they don't know why  
How much will a smile, you satisfy  
Stars gonna shine, the way that you feel  
So there is no reason, I wonder why  
  
[Chorus x3]
