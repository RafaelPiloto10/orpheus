Backwoods killer from a river town  
A mixed up kid that let his hair hang down  
High school rebel, he's always been bad  
And his poor old man's still wond'ring 'bout the lad  
But he's gone, gone away to find his fortune.  
  
There's a long-haired lady lookin' for a home  
With her young son, he'd left them both alone  
And his black-haired lover's got a broken heart  
'Cause her lonely boy just won't play the part  
'Cause he's gone, gone away to find his fortune.  
  
And it's been a long, long way  
From that little town to L.A.  
And I can't turn around  
Ladies, I'm gone, gone away to find my fortune.  
  
A restless nature fed my crazy dreams  
So I packed my bags in a big limousine  
laughed at the people who were laughin' at me  
Laughed and said I'm gonna be what I be  
And I'm gone, gone away to find my fortune.
