There're many things in life I can endure  
One such thing is poverty  
But loneliness, loneliness  
Is one thing I can't endure  
  
There're many things in the world I can endure  
One such thing is humility  
But loneliness, loneliness  
(Loneliness, loneliness)  
Is something I can't endure  
  
How could I stand loneliness, loneliness?  
How are you suppose to cope with loneliness, loneliness?  
How would one live with loneliness, loneliness, lo, oh, loneliness?  
(Oh, loneliness)  
  
There are many things in time and space I can endure  
In fact, I can endure most anything  
But loneliness, loneliness  
(Loneliness, loneliness)  
Is something I can't endure  
  
How could I stand loneliness, loneliness?  
How are you suppose to cope with loneliness, loneliness?  
How would one live with loneliness, loneliness, lo, oh, loneliness?  
Lo, oh, loneliness

Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely  
Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely  
Loneliness, so lonely, loneliness, so lonely  
Loneliness, so lonely
