Belle  
  
There's something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined  
But now he's dear, and so unsure  
I wonder why I didn't see it there before  
  
Mme. De la grande bouche  
  
Come along dearie.  
Let's get you off those wet things.  
  
Beast  
  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw  
No it can't be, I'll just ignore  
But then she's never looked at me that way before  
  
Beast  
  
Belle, I have something to show you.  
But first, you have to close your eyes.  
It's a surprise!  
  
Belle  
  
May I open them?  
  
Beast  
  
Alright, alright. Now!  
  
Belle  
  
I can't believe it!  
I've never seen so many books in my whole life!  
  
Beast  
  
You like it?  
  
Belle  
  
It's wonderful!  
  
Beast  
  
It's yours!  
  
Belle  
  
New and a bit alarming  
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?  
True that he's no Prince Charming  
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see  
  
(spoken)  
Oh, this is one of my favorites!  
It's "King Arthur."  
Have you ever read it?  
  
Beast  
  
No.  
  
Belle  
  
You don't know what you're missing.  
I'd love to read this again.  
Wait... You can read this first.  
  
Beast  
  
No, that's alright  
  
Belle  
  
No, really, you read it  
  
Beast  
  
Oh, no, you...  
  
Belle  
  
No, you  
  
Beast  
  
No! I can't...  
  
Belle  
  
You never learned to read?  
  
Beast  
  
Only a little, and long ago  
  
Belle  
  
Well, it just so happens that this is the perfect book to read aloud. Come
here, sit by me  
  
Lumiere  
  
Well, who'd have thought?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Well, bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth  
  
Well, who'd have known?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Well, who indeed?  
  
Lumiere  
  
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
It's so peculiar. Wait and see  
  
Lumiere and cogsworth  
  
We'll wait and see  
  
All three  
  
A few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Cogsworth  
  
Perhaps there's something there  
That wasn't there before  
  
Chip  
  
What?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Chip  
  
What's there, Mama?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Ssh. I'll tell you when you're older.  
Come along now. Let's give them some privacy...  
  
Chip  
  
Mama?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Yes, Chip  
  
Chip  
  
Will I ever get to be a boy again?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
I hope so  
  
Chip  
  
When will I know?  
  
Mrs. Potts  
  
Soon. If it's to be. It will be very soon now. Come along, son.  
  
Belle  
  
Knowing now, that this was indeed the legendary sword called "Excalibur,"
Arthur tried to pull it from the stone. He tried  
Once to no avail. He tried a second time, but still, he could not pull it out.
Then, for the third time, Arthur drew forth the  
Sword...  
  
Beast  
  
So that must mean he's the king!  
  
Belle  
  
Wait and see  
  
Beast  
  
I never knew books could do that  
  
Belle  
  
Do what?  
  
Beast  
  
Take me away from this place, make me forget for a little while  
  
Belle  
  
Forget?  
  
Beast  
  
Who I... What I am...  
  
Belle  
  
We have something in common, you know  
  
Beast  
  
What is that?  
  
Belle  
  
In the town where I come from, the people think I'm odd  
  
Beast  
  
You?  
  
Belle  
  
So, I know how it feels to be... Different. And I know how lonely that can be  
  
Belle  
  
For the third time, Arthur drew forth the sword, and there arose from the
people a great shout. Arthur is king.  
  
Beast  
  
I told you so...
