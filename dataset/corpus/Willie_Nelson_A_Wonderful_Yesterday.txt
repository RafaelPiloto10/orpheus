Today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday  
One on which I know that I can look back and smile  
And with you here with me the hours have flown away  
And today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday  
Today we have made a thousand and one memories  
That we can recall when today is a sweet used to be  
And with you in my arms the future seems so far away  
And today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday
