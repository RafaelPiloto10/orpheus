How did you know that I'm all alone, today  
Oh I feel so scared and I wanna go away  
I bleed so deep underneath  
My soul is screaming  
  
I'm not gonna hide  
I'm not gonna run away  
I'll uncover the scars and show you every mistake  
Your love is mending my blisters and the bruising shame  
Here with you  
I am safe  
  
Drown in the tears wont make it go away  
Its robbing my soul so im taking this mask off my face, yea  
To discover love and uncover all it means to live and breathe  
  
I'm not gonna hide  
I'm not gonna run away  
I'll uncover the scars and show you every mistake  
You're love is mending my blisters and the bruising shame  
Here with you  
  
I am safe  
I am safe  
I am safe  
I am safe  
  
When you uncover I discover  
I am not afraid  
But when were hiding  
We end up fighting  
To be, safe  
Yea  
  
I'm not gonna hide  
I'm not gonna run away  
Ill uncover the scares and show you every mistake  
Your love is mending my blisters and my bruising shame  
Here with you  
I am safe  
I am safe  
I am safe  
I am safe  
I am Safe
