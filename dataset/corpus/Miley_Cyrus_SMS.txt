[Verse:]  
All the way in the back, with a tree on my lap  
All the boys like to ask me, what you doing with that  
If you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that  
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack  
One day he wants me, one day he wants me not  
I don't do chances, cause time isn't what I got  
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at  
I can't be sitting round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my
cv at  
Where Mike Will at  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff, bangerz bangerz  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff  
I can strut in my stuff, bangerz  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff  
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff  
Fucking bangerz  
I can strut in my stuff bangerz bangerz  
  
[Verse 2: Britney Spears]  
I'm flying high upon the bird, acrophobia  
My slick carder, I ain't down my purse where the dollars at  
I let them know the rings two on the first  
They can call the hearse cause if there's anybody violation I go off with that  
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with the big dog  
All I need is milli's when I got Billy on my speed dial  
You know I'm that meow, quick to scratch your eyes out  
Strutting on the corner, make them nervous, call it too much  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Play boss the play  
Doctor get that big ross  
Sit that on my hand  
Make that video big talk  
Play boss the play  
Strike that boss with the purple  
Got up in my brain  
Had me a little bit dismal  
  
[Outro:]  
I, I bangerz, I, I fucking bangerz I, I bangerz fucking bangerz
