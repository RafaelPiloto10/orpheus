I was here when time began  
I was in them all  
A wicked one magician's hand  
I'm what john had saw  
I'm a thing that lives and breathers  
  
With slaves to worship me  
There are many that are born of me  
Anytime there are many me's  
Crowned messiah, I crucified him  
  
And still ya don't believe  
I am kings - I am queens  
Unholy terrors me  
I'm the feces of the species  
  
Still you're all in awe  
I'm something a prophet saw  
Hister with a rise all fall  
Obsessed with lennon  
  
Manifested marx  
I'm incest in the hearts of dark  
I'm riding on some atomic bomb -  
To blind you all into king-dom-come--  
I am - I am - I am - I am
