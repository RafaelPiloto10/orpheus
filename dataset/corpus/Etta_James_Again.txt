Again  
This couldn't happen again  
This is that once in a lifetime  
This is the thrill divine  
  
What's more  
This never happened before  
Though I have prayed for a lifetime  
That such as you would suddenly, suddenly be mine  
  
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now  
And never, never, never so near  
Mine to have when the now  
And the here disappear  
  
What matters, what matters, dear, for when  
This doesn't happen again  
We'll have this moment forever  
But never, never again  
  
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now  
And never, never, never so near  
Mine to have when the now  
And the here disappear and oh  
  
What matters, what matters, what matters, dear, for when  
This doesn't happen again  
We'll have this moment forever  
But never, never again, again  
Never, never again, again
