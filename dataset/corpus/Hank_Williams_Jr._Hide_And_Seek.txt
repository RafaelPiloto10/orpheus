I think uncle sam killed Maralyn Monroe  
I think there's a lot of things  
Our leaders don't want us to know like  
Why is it so easy to buy crack out on the street  
It's our national shame playing these games  
Playing hide and seek  
  
Now what if you an I was a hundred thousandover  
On our bank accounts?  
And the s and L scandal,tax payers can bail 'em out  
And the Anita Hill Hearings, what exactly did that prove  
Except that a lot of senators think they're holier than you  
  
Let's cover it up Let' hide it No one can ever tell  
Let's cover it up let's hide it before it starts to smell  
Don't rock the boat,don't make any waves  
Just write a brand new speech  
Well here we are two hunderd years old  
And we're still playin' hide andseek  
  
Now the Rodney King case, if that ain't the livin' proof  
Six guys nearly beat 'im to death, and they all flew th coop  
And I don't like those odds of six goin' on one  
We're all playin' hide and seek, and noones havin' fun  
  
Our president didn't go to Viet Nam, he went  
To harvard to write a speech  
Now come on who's kiddin' who  
It's American hide and seek
