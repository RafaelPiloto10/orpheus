Don't have to humble yourself to me,  
I ain't your judge or your king  
Baby, you know I ain't no Queen of Sheba  
We may not even have our dignity,  
This could be just a powerful thing  
Baby we can choose you know we ain't no amoeba  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Don't come from me and you,  
It comes from up above  
I ain't no porcupine,  
Take off your kid gloves  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
  
I ain't some icon carved out of soap  
Sent here to clean up your reputation  
Baby, you know you ain't no Prince Charming  
We can live in fear or act out of hope  
For some kind of peaceful situation  
Baby, how come the cry of love is so alarming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ugly ducklings don't turn into swans  
And glide off down the lake  
Whether your sunglasses are off or on  
You only see the world you make  
  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Don't come from me and you,  
It comes from up above  
I ain't no porcupine,  
Take off your kid gloves  
  
Are you ready for it  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Don't come from me and you,  
It comes from up above  
I ain't no porcupine,  
Take off your kid gloves  
  
Are you ready for it  
Are you ready for love, baby  
Oh yeah babe  
Are you ready for love
