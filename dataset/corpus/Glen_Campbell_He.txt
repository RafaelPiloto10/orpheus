He can turn the ties and calm the angry sea  
He alone besides who writes a symphony  
He lights every star that makes a darkness bright  
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night  
He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer  
Saint or sinner call and always find him there  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive  
(He can grab a wish or make a dream come true)  
He can paint the clouds and turn the gray to blue)  
He alone knows where to find a rainbow's end  
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend  
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold  
He knows every lie that you and I have told  
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say I forgive
