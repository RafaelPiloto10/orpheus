I went to church on Sunday  
My love, she passed me by  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye  
  
My love's fair and proper  
Her waist is neat and small  
She is quite good-looking  
And that' s the best of all  
And that' s the best of all  
And that' s the best of all  
And she is quite good-looking  
And that' s the best of all  
  
Oh, Hannah, loving Hannah  
Come give to me your hand  
You said that if you're married  
That i will be the one  
That i will be the one  
That i will be the one  
You said that if you're married  
That i will be the one  
  
I will go down by the river  
When everyone's asleep  
I'll think of loving Hannah  
And then sit down and grieve  
And then sit down and grieve  
And then sit down and grieve  
I'll think of loving Hannah  
And then sit down and grieve  
  
I went to church on Sunday  
My love she passed me by  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
By the roving of her eye  
I knew her mind was changing  
By the roving of her eye
