I don't need you to mend my broken heart  
Not afraid you can throw your sticks and stones  
But this love is tearing me apart  
I've got a wounded heart  
  
And it won't stop beating  
Tried to keep it a casual affair  
Nonetheless we get careless ''cause we care  
Why does love make me fall apart  
  
It only hurts my heart  
And it won't stop beating  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop beating  
  
No matter what I do  
A wounded heart  
That keeps repeating  
I'm missing you  
  
Missing you  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop leading  
Me right back to you  
  
A wounded heart  
Do you need me like I need you  
You know I'm tryin'  
To get some piece of mind  
  
But I can't seem to put  
The past behind  
I don't want you  
Living in my dreams  
  
No matter how it seems  
I don't want you  
I gotta wounded heart  
And it won't stop beating  
  
No matter what I do  
A wounded heart  
That keeps repeating  
I'm missing you  
  
Missing you  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop leading  
Me right back to you  
  
A wounded heart  
You need me like I need you  
  
Oh you know I'm missing you, ooh  
I gotta wounded heart  
And it won't stop beating  
No matter what I do  
  
A wounded heart  
That keeps repeating  
I'm missing you  
I'm missing you, missing you  
  
Got a wounded heart  
And it won't stop leading  
Me right back to you  
A wounded heart  
  
Keeps repeating  
I'm missing you
