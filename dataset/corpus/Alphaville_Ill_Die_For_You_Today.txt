Come in close to me and bring me joy  
Lift me higher, much higher and higher than light allows  
I wanted to be everything, everything for you  
I wanted you, I needed you, I thought that you did too  
You built me beauty and took it all away  
And I can't face another day...  
I'll die for you today...  
  
Tempt me, sweet tempest - and shower me with stars  
I want to be as beautiful as you  
Take me to the summit and show me  
Show me all that I could ever have  
You brought me everything, I ever thought I wanted  
And now you take it all away  
You gave me love and then you killed me blindly  
I think I'll die for you today, I can't persue another way...  
I'll die for you today...  
  
Like a garden growin' in flames  
A forest filled with fear of the wind  
Like the moon so beautiful from afar  
But shattered on the surface, full of scars  
A sea with no more fish, planets without air  
Whales with no more song  
I know I'm gonna die with them today...  
I'll die for you today...
