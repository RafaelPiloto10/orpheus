I am hooked on you  
I am ready to go  
I am ready to dance  
Are you?  
I wanna see it  
  
Lights turn always like 90 degrees  
Your standing on the wall but baby not me  
Taking center stage come on the floor  
Rolling till I break doing this and more

Taking center stage come on the floor  
Rolling till I break doing this and more  
  
Do it to the floor, boy shake  
Do it till the windows break  
The whole room vibrates  
And it's like an earthquake

Just lace them shoes tight  
And bring it down to the floor (that's right)  
Under these lights (we working it hard)

On you, on you  
  
I say it again like I said it before  
I'm in the middle took it to the floor  
Shadows on the wall, steam is on my back  
Sweat dripping hard, feel it drip, drip, drop

Loving in the club no not right now  
Sweating until it hurt while the music's loud
