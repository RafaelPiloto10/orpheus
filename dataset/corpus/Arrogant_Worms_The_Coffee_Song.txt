Young Derrick would love to take my order  
He works at the coffee place just up the street  
He's happy and annoying with a smirk the size of Texas  
He's my coffee enemy  
Would you like a mochacino?  
Or perhaps a cappucino?  
Or maybe a frappucino?  
Said Derrick wearing the chinos  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
So strong the spoon stands up just a cup of coffee  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee, Derrick  
You should try out biscotti  
Or a low-cal cabbage cookie  
This muffin's only 3.50  
And what's super great is that it's fat free  
Don't wanna smell like an espresso  
With your coffee scented soap  
Maybe you should have some chai tea  
Or maybe join me in some tai chi  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
In a non-biodegradable cup just a cup of coffee  
All I really want is a cup of coffee  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee  
Oh Derrick why won't you listen to me  
I don't want a magazine or a CD  
I don't want a latte or a frappe  
Just give me a coffee that doesn't taste crappe  
All I really want is a cup of coffee (3X)  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee  
All I really want (3X)  
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee, Derrick
