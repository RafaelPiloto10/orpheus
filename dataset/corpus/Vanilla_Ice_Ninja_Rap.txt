YO! It's the green machine  
Gonna rock the town without being seen  
Have you ever seen a turtle Get Down?  
Slammin and Jammin to the new swing sound  
Yeah, everybody let's move  
Vanilla is here with the New Jack Groove  
Gonna rock, And roll this place  
With the power of the ninja turtle bass  
Iceman, ya know I'm not playin  
Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin  
  
[Chorus]  
Ninja, Ninja, RAP! Ninja, Ninja, RAP! GO GO GO GO!  
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!  
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!  
GO GO GO GO!  
  
Lyrics, fill in the gap  
Drop that bass and get the NINJA RAP  
Feel it, if you know what I mean  
Give it up, for those heroes in green  
Just flowin, smooth with the power  
Kickin' it up, Hour after hour  
Cause in this life there's only one winner  
You better aim straight so you can hit the center  
In it to win it, With a team of four  
Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore it's the  
  
Chorus  
  
Villains you better run and hide  
Because one day you might not slide  
So choose, your weapon don't slip  
Vanilla's in control with the flex of the mic grip  
Rockin' the crowd the way it should be rocked  
With the Miami drop that you like a lot  
You know it's hittin, Like a ninja turtle  
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level  
The power of the ninja is strong  
Fightin the crooks 'til they're all gone  
  
[Chorus: x2]
