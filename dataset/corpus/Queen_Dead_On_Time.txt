Fool always jumpin' never happy where you land  
Fool got my business make your living where you can  
Hurry down the highway  
Hurry down the road  
Hurry past the people starin'  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry  
  
Leave on time leave on time  
Never got your ticket but you leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
Gonna get your ticket but you leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
Put it in your pocket but you never can tell  
  
Leave on time leave on time  
Shake that rattle gotta leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
Fight your battle but you leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
Never got a minute no you never got a minute  
No you never never got oh no matter  
  
Fool got no business hangin' round and tellin' lies  
Fool you got no reasons but you got no compromise  
Stampin' on the ceilin' hammering on the walls  
Gotta get out gotta get out gotta get  
Oh you know I'm goin' crazy  
  
Leave on time leave on time  
Gotta get ahead but you leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
Gotta head on ahead but you leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
You're runnin' in the red but you never can tell  
  
Honey honey where's my money where's my money  
Want to get away want to get away  
Leave ya leave ya leave ya  
  
Leave on time leave on time  
Gotta get rich gonna leave on time  
Leave on time leave on time  
But you can't take it with you when you leave on time  
  
Leave on time leave on time  
Got to keep yourself alive gotta leave on time  
Gotta leave on time leave on time  
Dead on time  
You're dead
