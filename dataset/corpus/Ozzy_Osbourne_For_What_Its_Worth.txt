There's something happening here  
What it is ain't exactly clear  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware  
  
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Battle lines being drawn  
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong  
People speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
  
Yeah, stop children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
What a field-day for the heat  
Ten thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say, hooray for our side  
  
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when you're always afraid  
Step out of line, the man come and take you away  
  
Stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
You better stop!  
Stop  
You better stop!  
Stop  
You better stop!
