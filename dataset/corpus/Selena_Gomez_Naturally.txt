How you choose to express yourself  
It's all your own and I can tell  
It comes naturally, it comes naturally  
  
You follow what you feel inside  
It's intuitive you don't have to try  
It comes naturally, mmm yeah, it comes naturally  
  
And it takes my breath away  
What you do so naturally  
  
You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are  
And to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Bay bay bay baby  
  
You have a way of moving me  
Your force of nature, your energy  
It comes naturally (you know it does)  
It comes naturally  
  
And it takes my breath away  
What you do, so naturally  
  
You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are  
And to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Bay bay bay baby  
  
When we collide, sparks fly  
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away  
  
(You are) You are the thunder and I am the lightning  
And I love the way you know who you are  
And to me it's exciting  
When you know it's meant to be  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
When you're with me, baby  
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally  
Bay bay baby
