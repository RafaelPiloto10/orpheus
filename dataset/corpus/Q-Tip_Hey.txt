The name is Q-Tip, enterin through the middle  
from the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles  
Comin from the maximum gain, the octane  
that's on the radio it made me feel so low  
It seems we gotta, brighten, the damp prison  
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision  
Bustin from no mo' trey-eights, now papi weight  
This joint is like a Ruger, watch it roar like a cougar  
And we gotta, move on the dancefloor  
and work it out all night that's what you came here for  
Just chem', I fills it to the rim, your shine is lookin dim  
Daddy shine the light on him, ahem it's me  
Leader of the Starfleet Force  
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course, we took the loss?  
Damn right, sure as Tina made Ike  
We gonna put it in your noggin all night, and all day  
The Trilateral commission we dissin  
Tellin citizens be straight, but like snakes they hissin  
I'll be damned if I let his song fall to the side  
Goin piggybackin shit, let's ride, c'mon  
  
I put it down, now what you gonna do (8X)  
Hey, now, what you gonna do, with yourself, hah? (4X)  
When you hear this, recognize you hear love  
MC nigga illin over be -boy dubs  
Riding through the shit like Tron  
Doesn't matter if you onboard, do you want to get on?  
Cause if you do, watch all the moves that we make  
Gotta do the things right, ain't no time for mistake  
It's the hip-hop cat that can't, fuck with Jake  
Just because he wear a badge doesn't, mean he straight so  
what you want to swallow it down or let's take it  
Disregard those who fake it, yo it doesn't matter  
about the realm, hip-hop is to the helm  
It's divine to hit the mind like slippery elms  
So put it down man, put it on down  
Put it down man, put it on down  
Put it down woman, put it on down  
Put it down man, put it on down  
Put it down man, whatchu gonna do  
Put it down woman, whatchu gonna do  
A-put it down man, whatchu gonna do  
Put it down woman, whatchu gonna do
