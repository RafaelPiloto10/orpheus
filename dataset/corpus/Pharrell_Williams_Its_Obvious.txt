Y-yea . . .  
The flow so amazin' nigga!  
Uh, it's yo boy . . young  
Uh huh, I brought Rell wit me  
Timbo on the track  
J-Breezy! Take it easy I got ya homie  
Let's do the damn thing Rell  
  
  
When girls stop and stare it's obvious it's the "Roc"  
Your vision's impaired it's obvious it's the watch  
Park nine for being pasumptious  
It could be that ash it cuts in my ear or some shit  
Oh stop your dumb shit, Hov is hot  
It ain't just hoes and guns shit, I switch top  
Big sneakers can't see wit their op-tics  
They optical allusions don't confuse dudes wit him  
Uh, it's obvious stayin' used to win  
Used to being in that Jeep deuce deuce like him  
G-4 land a teeted barrel (whoo)  
Fitted sombrero to the side, nigga my stride is so ghetto  
Projects strut, hop out the plane hop in my truck  
Just in time, hop off my thugs  
It's obvious you got hate in you thug  
You want the crown you got to take it in blood  
Nigga what! (c'mon)  
  
Wit every step, wit every move  
Scared of me, in the mood  
All I see, is her and me  
Gettin' down, I said gettin' down!  
I love her frown, I love her smile  
Most of all, I love that she's wild  
Watchin' her, watchin' me  
Escapin' to her, she's talkin' to me!  
  
  
Girl, I can tell by the look in your eyes  
And the way that you back it up  
I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious!  
Plus, I'm a freak and I know it's your style  
Cause we get bubble while makin' love  
I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious!  
  
It's in your walk, it's in your vibe  
In your claws, some in your eyes  
Chasin' you, you chasin' me  
We belong, like Adam and Eve  
You're the Queen, I'm the King  
Shall no one, intervene  
Kinky things, thuggish things  
Crazy things, anything!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
  
I can, I can tell  
I can, I can tell that you like it rough  
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough  
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough (I can't deny it baby!)  
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough (so don't complicate it!)  
  
[Bridge: Rell]  
Don't complicate it (noo no)  
Be my lady (love or hate it)  
Love or hate it (nooo)  
You belong to me (babe)  
Don't complicate it (said don't complicate it)  
Be my lady (be my lady)  
Don't contemplate it (nooo nooo)  
You belong to me  
  
[Chorus] (2x)
