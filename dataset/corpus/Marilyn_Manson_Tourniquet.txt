She's made of hair and bone and little teeth  
And things that cannot speak  
She comes on like a crippled plaything  
Her spine is just a string  
  
I wrapped our love in all this foil  
Silver tight like spider legs  
I never wanted it to ever spoil  
But flies will always lay their eggs  
  
Take your hatred out on me  
Make your victim my head  
You never ever believed in me  
I am your tourniquet  
  
Prosthetic synthesis and butterfly  
Sealed up with virgin stitch  
If it hurts baby please tell me  
Preserve the innocence  
I never wanted it to end like this  
But flies will lay their eggs  
  
Take your hatred out on me  
Make your victim my head  
You never ever believed in me  
I am your tourniquet  
  
What I wanted, what I needed  
What I got for me  
What I wanted, what I needed  
What I got for me  
  
Take your hatred out on me  
Make your victim my head  
You never ever believed in me  
I am your tourniquet  
  
Take your, take your  
Get up out of me  
I'm not proud with me  
I never ever believed in me
