Six lanes tail lights  
Red ants marchin' into the night  
They disappear to the left and right again  
Another supper  
From a sack  
A ninety nine cent heart attack  
I got a poundin' head and an achin' back  
And the camels buried in a big straw stack  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close, to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed  
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Where the green grass grows  
  
Well I'm from  
A map dot  
A stop sign on a blacktop  
I caught the first bus, I could hop from there  
But all o' this glitter is gettin' dark  
There's concrete glowin' in the city park  
I don't know who my neighbors are  
And there's bars on the corner and bars on my heart  
  
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close, to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed  
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Where the green grass grows  
  
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close, to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed  
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Whoa where the green grass grows
