Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Build on rock, or build on sand  
They're never gonna lend a hand  
So nothing grows or nothing stands  
I can't take anymore, I can't take anymore  
'Cause there's not a lot of space for me  
But I've still got my dignity  
I've got my price, don't say I'm free  
I can't take anymore, I can't take anymore  
But I'm hungry, I could eat anything  
But I'm hungry, ooh, let's dance, ooh, let's swing  
And all that I hear are the words that she sings  
Now they've taken it all, now they've taken it all  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
I'd rather take this cure for life  
Than make myself a sacrifice  
When living is to pay the price  
I can't take anymore, I can't take anymore  
It takes a while to understand  
When your eyes are full of sand  
When only time is in your hands  
I can't take anymore, I can't take anymore  
But I'm hungry, I could eat anything  
But I'm hungry ooh, let's dance, ooh, let's swing  
And all that I hear are the words that she sings  
Now they've taken it all, now they've taken it all  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Oh, but I'm hungry, I could eat anything  
And I'm hungry ooh, let's dance, ooh, let's swing  
And all that I hear are the words that she sings  
Now they've taken it all, now they've taken it all  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Leave me with the pride  
With the pride that I worked for today  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for  
Now they've taken the reason away  
Just leave me with the pride that I worked for today  
Leave me with the pride  
Leave me with the pride
