All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
From creation, the mask of God  
Inspiration is all we've got  
Hidden knowledge, can't get enough,  
Taking chances, making love  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, shedding skin  
Age of reason lies within  
Explanation, the club of Rome  
Meditation, and staying home  
Moving forward, the chosen few  
Teach your children what is new  
Band the table, beat the drum  
New messiah, overcome  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide
