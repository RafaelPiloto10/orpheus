There's something strange happening in the neighborhood.  
The strangest things you've ever seen.  
They're all dressed up in their costumes and looking good.  
  
Trick-or-treat it's Halloween! (Halloween?)  
  
Halloween comes October thirty-one.  
It's a creepy crawly night. (What Night?)  
They're tricks and treats and fun for everyone.  
  
Trick-or-treat it's Halloween (Halloween?)  
  
I just love Halloween!  
  
SCREAM!
