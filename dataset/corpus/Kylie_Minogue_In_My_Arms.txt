How do you describe a feeling?  
I've only ever dreamt of this  
  
Oh  
Dj's spinning up my favorite song,  
Hurry up and get a groove on  
Light fantastic and it won't be long,  
Don't let the moment slip away  
  
'Cause you and I could find a pleasure,  
No one else has ever known  
Feels like it is now or never, don't want to be alone  
  
How does it feel in my arms?  
How does it feel in my arms?  
Do you want it?  
Do you need it?  
Can you feel it?  
Tell me  
How does it feel in my arms?  
  
Got a feeling this is something strong  
All I wanna do is move on  
No more wondering where I belong  
So never go away  
  
'Cause you and I are guilty pleasure,  
No one else has ever known  
Feels like it is now or never, don't want to be alone  
  
How does it feel in my arms? (How does it feel in my arms?)  
How does it feel in my arms?  
Do you want it?  
Do you need it?  
Can you feel it?  
Tell me  
How does it feel in my arms?  
  
I'm listening  
How does it feel in my arms? (How does it feel in my arms?)  
How does it feel in my arms? Yeah, yeah  
Do you want it?  
Do you need it?  
Can you feel it?  
Tell me  
How does it feel in my arms?
