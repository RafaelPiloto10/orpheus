You are so unpredictable  
When I am not  
You are so irresistible  
That I can't stop  
You say my name  
And I start walking on heaven  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What extraterrestrial planet are you from  
You're much more than life  
You're from galaxy paradise  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What will they say when they find that you're gone  
Say you'll stay in life  
Queen from galaxy paradise  
  
You are so unforgettable  
And I will not  
Our love's far more than sensual  
And twice as hot  
You touch my hand  
And I know that we'll love forever  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What extraterrestrial planet are you from  
You're much more than life  
You're from galaxy paradise  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What will they say when they find that you're gone  
Say you'll stay in life  
Queen from galaxy paradise
