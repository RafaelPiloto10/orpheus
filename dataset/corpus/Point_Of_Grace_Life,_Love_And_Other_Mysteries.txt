You are Lord of life, love and other mysteries  
I find in You all I ever need to know  
  
Some say that life is a string of romances  
To some it's a series of choices and chances  
While some only live for the curious dances  
Of whatever music's at hand  
  
And some look for love in the eyes of a stranger  
And some love the thrill of the edges of danger  
But I have found joy in a world filled with anger  
'Cause I finally understand  
  
Chorus:  
You are Lord of life, love and other mysteries  
You know my future, You know my history  
I find in You all I ever need to know  
About life and love and other mysteries  
  
I cannot reason with men in defiance  
Or try to explain all the mysteries of science  
'Cause I'm just a child in the face of these giants  
But I never face them alone  
  
Cause when it seems that my heart is surrounded  
When all of our questions of life have been sounded  
I rest in the hope where my faith has been grounded  
I do not fear the unknown, 'cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Your wisdom confounds the wisest of wise  
Your mercy is truth in a world full of lies  
Your grace saves us all from a certain demise  
  
CHORUS (2x)  
  
You are lord of life, you're lord of love  
(and other mysteries)  
You are lord of life, you're lord of love  
(other mysteries)
