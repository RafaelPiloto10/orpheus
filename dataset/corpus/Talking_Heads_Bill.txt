Bill was a man  
Who grew too big  
It didn't matter what he did  
The girls would always run away  
When everybody laughs at you  
It can be humiliating  
  
Billy likes a  
Cute little girl  
They are lovers  
We can tell  
Kisses on the mouth  
Holding hands 'n' all  
Look into their eyes...  
  
Sneaking off together  
Running to the woods  
Swimming in the river  
Cooking up some food  
Making up religions  
Dropping out of school  
Laughing through the summertime  
Never meant to hurt nobody  
  
Angel of God  
Take me along  
Happy days  
Quiet life  
We are not alone...  
  
He bought a gun  
And she fixed her dress  
"I'm not afraid of Jesus Christ  
Who cares about the price we pay"  
It's our little secret  
And we're never, never, never going  
  
Angel of God  
Take me along  
Happy days  
Quiet life  
We are not alone...
