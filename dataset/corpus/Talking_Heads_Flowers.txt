Here we stand  
Like an adam and an eve  
Waterfalls  
The garden of eden  
Two fools in love  
So beautiful and strong  
The birds in the trees  
Are smiling upon them  
From the age of the dinosaurs  
Cars have run on gasoline  
Where, where have they gone?  
Now, it's nothing but flowers  
  
There was a factory  
Now there are mountains and rivers  
You got it, you got it  
  
We caught a rattlesnake  
Now we got something for dinner  
We got it, we got it  
  
There was a shopping mall  
Now it's all covered with flowers  
You've got it, you've got it  
  
If this is paradise  
I wish I had a lawnmower  
You've got it, you've got it  
  
Years ago  
I was an angry young man  
I'd pretend  
That I was a billboard  
Standing tall  
By the side of the road  
I fell in love  
With a beautiful highway  
This used to be real estate  
Now it's only fields and trees  
Where, where is the town  
Now, it's nothing but flowers  
The highways and cars  
Were sacrificed for agriculture  
I thought that we'd start over  
But I guess I was wrong  
  
Once there were parking lots  
Now it's a peaceful oasis  
You got it, you got it  
  
This was a pizza hut  
Now it's all covered with daisies  
You got it, you got it  
  
I miss the honky tonks  
Dairy queens, and 7-elevens  
You got it, you got it  
  
And as things fell apart  
Nobody paid much attention  
You got it, you got it  
  
I dream of cherry pies,  
Candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies  
You got it, you got it  
  
We used to microwave  
Now we just eat nuts and berries  
You got it, you got it  
  
This was a discount store  
Now it's turned into a cornfield  
You got it, you got it  
  
Don't leave me stranded here  
I can't get used to this lifestyle
