Well hello baby  
Come sit down, make your self comfortable  
Tell me something, how long have we known each other?  
About ten months huh?  
  
Say what's that on your finger? An engagement ring?  
So you and john are getting engaged huh?  
You know he's a mighty lucky guy  
Should be proud to have a woman like you  
Listen, I've got something to tell you  
  
Don't think I'm getting fresh or anything like that  
But this things been bugging me for a long time you know  
And its getting heavier each and every day  
And I've just gotta get it off my chest  
See I've never seen anyone like you  
I've never known anyone like you  
  
Let me take me back to my childhood a while  
See we had a medium size family you know we weren't rich  
But my mother tried to bring us us the best she could  
Didn't commit no crime nor nothing  
  
But I had to reach man hood to commit this crime  
According to the code of love, if there is such a code  
See love is a thing well, you know?  
It's a bit like quicksand  
  
The more you wriggle the deeper you sink  
And when it hit's you you've just got to fall  
That's why I do believe that I am Guilty  
Guilty of loving you
