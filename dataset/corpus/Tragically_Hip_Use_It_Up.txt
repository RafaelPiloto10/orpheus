Use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later  
If there's music out there laying in wait  
To pounce and drain every ounce if you  
Wait or hesitate  
And music that'll help you be tough  
And come together on more than  
Springsteen  
Though most days it's been enough  
Then there's music that can take you away  
Away  
Away  
Away  
  
So use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later  
Use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later  
  
If there's music out there staying awake  
To cry and drain every eye until  
Hatred's eliminated  
And music that can help you feel great  
And come together in 'the fictive dream'  
With a kind of Randy Newman take  
There's music that can take you away  
Away  
Away  
Away  
Where we can jump to our feet, agape  
Cause nothing is cruel  
And even if it is or was  
Indefeasibly cruel  
We don't care because  
Yer a fool  
I'm a fool  
Yer a fool  
And I'm a fool  
For music that can take you away  
For music that can take you away  
For music that can take you away  
  
So use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later
