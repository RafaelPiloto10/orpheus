Time can't fix it fast enough,  
So we won't notice what it was that went wrong  
I saw something there much too familiar  
A butterfly with a broken wing  
She's fallen under, she's past the end,  
Communication is down again  
The scars have healed but they're back again  
We've got to believe this man must bend  
Because if you could you'd try and destroy her  
And there we would be with nothing at all  
Is it safe to be a man  
When your tired and lonely  
Only the confident know where to stand  
Is it safe to be man  
When the world is loaded with thousands  
That can't figure out just what they did  
Time can't fix it fast enough,  
So we won't measure just how far below you kept pushing her  
You'll have to pay back all of the years that you stole  
She's walking backwards,  
She's spun around her ears are ringing loud,  
How does it feel, does it make you mad?  
She's on her knees  
Please understand how obvious it is  
That this man must bend
