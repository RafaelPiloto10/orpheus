The Kicking ass says it's time to close  
We're leaning on each other try'na beat the cold  
Carry you're shoes and I give you my coat  
Walking these streets like their paved gold  
There anyone excuse's not to go  
Neither one of us want to take that taxi home  
  
Singing our hearts out standing on chairs  
Spending our time like we are millionaires  
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there  
Spending our time like we are millionaires  
Millionaires  
Ooohoh ooohoh  
Lost my heart and I hope to die  
Seeing that sunlight hit your eyes  
Been up all nigh but you still look amazing to me  
Yeah,  
Half the time of the night you only dream about  
If a god came down he could take me now  
Cause in my mind, yeah we will always be  
  
Singing our hearts out standing on chairs  
Spending our time like we are millionaires  
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there  
Spending our time like we are millionaires  
Millionaires  
Ooohoh ooohoh  
  
Check out us at six in the morning  
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune  
I swear you may think you're rich  
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this  
Look at us since six in the morning  
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune  
I swear you may think you're rich  
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this  
Bridge.  
And the band was on, playing our song  
We messed up the lyrics as we sang along  
But we didn't care,  
Cause it felt like we where the only ones there  
My feet where sore, my bones where raw  
They're turning off the lights, when we where shouting more  
Shouting more,  
  
Singing our hearts out standing on chairs  
Spending our time like we are millionaires  
Laughing our heads of, the two of us there  
Spending our time like we are millionaires  
Millionaires  
Ooohoh ooohoh  
  
Look at us since six in the morning  
If time was money, yeah we'd be worth a fortune  
I swear you may think you're rich  
You could have a million euro but you cant buy this  
  
Walking these streets like their paved gold  
There anyone excuse's not to go  
Neither one of us want to take that taxi home
