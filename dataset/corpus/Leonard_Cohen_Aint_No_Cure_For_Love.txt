I loved you for a long, long time  
I know this love is real  
It don't matter how it all went wrong  
That don't change the way I feel  
And I can't believe that time's  
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
I'm aching for you baby  
I can't pretend I'm not  
I need to see you naked  
In your body and your thought  
I've got you like a habit  
And I'll never get enough  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
There ain't no cure for love  
There ain't no cure for love  
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky  
The holy books are open wide  
The doctors working day and night  
But they'll never ever find that cure for love  
There ain't no drink no drug  
(Ah tell them, angels)  
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love  
  
I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus  
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up  
I see your hand, I see your hair  
Your bracelets and your brush  
And I call to you, I call to you  
But I don't call soft enough  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go  
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul  
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much  
It's written in the scriptures  
It's written there in blood  
I even heard the angels declare it from above  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
There ain't no cure for love  
There ain't no cure for love  
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky  
The holy books are open wide  
The doctors working day and night  
But they'll never ever find that cure,  
That cure for love
