I look around me  
I'm not the only  
Hungry for the love  
My heart needs to find  
But I've learned now  
You have to want to  
Find yourself inside  
To carry on  
  
Chorus  
Cause it hurts to love sometimes  
Oh it hurts to love someone  
Yes it hurts to lose sometimes  
Oh it hurts to lose someone  
  
So many hearts are broken  
So unnecessary  
And I'm afraid to fail  
Again and again  
I keep on searchingand I keep on fighting baby  
To learn to love myself like a child  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm gonna scram my pain out loud  
I'm gonna run  
I'm gonna free myself and fly  
Just like a baby birds first flight  
I will fall  
But I'll pick myself up and head to the sky  
  
Chorus  
  
It's all inside of you  
It's all inside of me  
It's all inside of everything you will see
