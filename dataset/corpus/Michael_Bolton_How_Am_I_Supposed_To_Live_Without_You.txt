I could hardly believe it  
When I heard the news today  
I had to come and get it straight from you  
They said you were leavin  
Someones swept your heart away  
From the look upon your face, I see it's true  
So tell me all about it, tell me bout the  
Plans you're makin  
Then tell me one thing more before I go  
  
Chorus  
Tell me how am I suppose to live without you  
Now that I've been lovin you so long  
How am I supposed to live without you  
How am I supposed to carry on  
When all that I've been livin for is gone  
  
I didn't come here for cryin'  
Didn't come here to break down  
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end  
And how can I blame you  
When I build my world around  
The hope that one day wed be so much  
More than friends  
And I don't wanna know the price I'm  
Gonna pay for dreaming  
When even now it's more than I can take  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
And I don't wanna face the price I'm  
Gonna pay for dreaming  
Now that your dream has come true  
  
Chorus
