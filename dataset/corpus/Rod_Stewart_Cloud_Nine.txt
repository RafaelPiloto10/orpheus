Darling, part of my life, it wasn't very pretty  
See, I was born and raised in the slums of the city  
It was a one room shack and slept 10 other children  
Beside me, we hardly had enough food or room to sleep  
  
It was hard times, I needed some thing  
To ease my troubled mind  
  
Listen, my father didn't know the meaning of work  
He disrespected mama and treated us like dirt  
I left home seeking a job that I never did find  
Depressed and down hearted, I took to cloud nine  
  
I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine  
Listen one more time, I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine  
  
Folks down there tell me  
They say, "Give your self a chance  
Son, don't let life pass you by  
But the world of reality is a rat race"  
  
Where only the strongly survive  
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie  
It ain't even safe no more to walk the streets  
At night, I'm doin' fine on cloud nine  
  
Let me tell you about cloud nine, cloud nine  
You can be what you want to be  
(Cloud nine)  
You ain't got no responsibilities  
And every man, every man is free  
(Cloud nine)  
  
You're a million miles from reality, reality  
I wanna say upper, higher, upper, up, up and away  
I wanna say I love the life I live  
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine  
  
I, I, I, I, I, I'm riding high on cloud nine  
  
Your as free as a bird in flight  
(Cloud nine)  
There's no difference between day and night  
(Cloud nine)  
It's a world of love and harmony  
(Cloud nine)  
You're a million miles from reality, reality wanna say  
  
Upper, higher, upper, up, up and away  
Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be  
(Cloud nine)  
You ain't got no responsibilities  
(Cloud nine)  
Every man and his mind is free  
  
You're a million miles from reality  
You can be what you wanna be  
I'm feelin' fine on cloud nine
