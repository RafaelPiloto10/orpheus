Love show me the way when I am lost and hope begins  
To fade  
Love timeless and true whenever  
I need strength  
I look to you  
Tonight my faith is strong enough to see me through  
Tonight you've got to trust in love the way I do  
We gotta hold on tight-tonight  
Hold on - nothing's gonna stop us if we just  
Believe in love  
Hold on - there's nothing under heaven we can't overcome-  
Hold on  
Now I see the way the tide'll turn and  
The part I'll play  
(it's) all part of a plan - you don't have to know  
Or understand tonight I'll see it all unfold before my eyes  
Tonight - with fortune on my side and love to  
Guide me  
The future is looking bright - tonight  
Hold on - nothings gonna stop us if we just  
Believe in love  
Hold on - there's nothing under heaven we can't  
Overcome so hold on  
And tho' the road ahead maybe unknown we'll  
Make it if we hold on
