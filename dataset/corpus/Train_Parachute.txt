I wanna take you with me  
To life with no more yesterdays  
We can start again awake and so excited  
And change the way we always push  
The way we pull  
  
I open up and be your parachute baby  
And I'll never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And we'll only hit the ground  
Running  
  
And when the world gets sharp and tries to cut you down to size  
And makes you feel like giving in  
Oh, I will stay, I will rain, I will wash the words and pain away  
And I will chase away the way we push  
The way we pull  
You're beautiful  
  
I'll open up and be your parachute  
  
And I'll never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And we'll only hit the ground  
Running  
  
And if it feels like we might drop  
It will stop  
So don't look down  
It wouldn't be the same without you  
This life is too good to give up on  
  
I'll open up and be your parachute  
And I'll never let you down  
So open up and be my human angel  
And we'll only hit the ground  
And we're gonna hit the ground  
Running
