I send flowers everyday  
But you just turn them away  
And my letters go unanswered  
So it seems  
  
Was I just too blind to see  
That you'd given up on me  
And it's over now  
Your broken heart won't mend  
  
Just one more dance  
Why don't we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I, were so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
Well I know I've been a fool  
And I know that I've been cruel  
When you give your love completely  
Heart and soul  
  
'Let it slipped right through my hands  
Can't you ever understand  
I've never felt this kind of love before  
  
Just one more dance  
Why don't we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I, are so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
My love has no pride  
I'm dying inside  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm down on my knees  
For your love  
  
Just one more dance  
Why don't we try  
Holding each other  
While the world stands still  
  
You and I, are so much in love  
And I would give anything  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more dance  
  
Why don't we try  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more time  
  
Why don't we try  
For the chance at romance  
Just one more time
