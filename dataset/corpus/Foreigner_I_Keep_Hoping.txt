As I gather my thoughts  
With the pieces of my heart  
How long is forever  
I'm not afraid and I won't be torn apart  
We've had our time together  
I'll start again at any cost  
I've learned a lot from losing you  
But I've got nothing if I'm lost  
And I keep hoping  
And I still believe in love  
If I wait long enough  
I know I'll be strong enough  
I keep hoping  
I believe in faith and trust  
I'm gonna find a way  
There are better days still ahead of us  
I keep hoping  
  
Now this candle burns low  
It won't last through the night  
But I've found peace  
And I know it's all right  
I try to understand  
What's been missing in my life  
Between the darkness and the daylight  
  
No I'm not expecting miracles  
I've got my doubts like any other one  
I've learned a lot from losing you  
But I've got nothing if I'm lost  
  
And I keep hoping  
And I still believe in love  
If I wait long enough  
I know I'll be strong enough  
I keep hoping  
I believe in faith and trust  
I'm gonna find a way  
There are better days still ahead of us  
I keep hoping, I keep hoping  
I keep hoping and praying baby  
And I still believe in love
