I'm in a bar full of bikers  
And a handful of junkies  
It's a fifty fifty chance that they're  
Plannin' to jump me  
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive oh  
  
Well my favorite little waitress has  
Ahold of my eyes  
But here's a shotgun  
Loaded hidden under the bar  
Her finger's on the trigger  
If anybody gets out of line  
  
There's other places that are better to go  
But I'm addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
I'm ready to go  
She's gonna like my pistol clean  
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go  
And I can't get enough of  
The things that she does, alright  
  
Well, she walks like a model  
And she talks like a trucker  
Doesn't want a lollipop  
But she sure loves a sucker  
They' re closin' in around her  
I'm cutting to the front of the line  
Oh, she grabbed a bottle of tequila  
And a lime for her lips  
Laid her body on the bar  
And put the salt on her hips  
Was lying when I told her  
That I'm the only gonna lick her tonight  
  
There's other places that are better to go  
But I'm addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
I'm ready to go  
She's gonna lick my pistol clean  
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go  
  
She's gonna be my sex machine  
And I can never get her under control  
She's gonna climb all over me  
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo  
And I can't get enough of  
The things that she does, alright  
  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
I'm ready to go  
She's gonna like my pistol clean  
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go  
  
She's gonna be my sex machine  
And I can never get her under control  
She's gonna climb all over me  
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo  
  
And I can't get enough of  
The things that she does, alright
