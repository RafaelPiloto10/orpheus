I am an arms dealer  
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words  
And I don't really care which side wins  
As long as the room keeps singing  
That's just the business I'm in  
  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress  
  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
  
I wrote the gospel on giving up (You look pretty sinking)  
But the real bombshells have already sunk (Prima donnas of the gutter)  
At night we're painting your trash gold while you sleep  
Crashing not like hips or cars  
No, more like parties  
  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
Bandwagon's full, please catch another  
  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
  
All the boys who the dance floor didn't love  
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough  
Sing until your lungs give out  
  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Now you)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Wear out the groove)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Sing out loud)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Oh, oh)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
