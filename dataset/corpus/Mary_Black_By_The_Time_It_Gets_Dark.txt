Baby every cloud has a silver lining  
Baby every dog really has his day  
And it matters to me to see you smiling  
Why don't you blow all your cares away  
Yesterday is gone and will be forgotten  
And today is where every new day starts  
Got to be free as the leaves in the autumn  
You may be sad but it will never last.  
Chorus  
Mabye by the evening we'll be laughing  
Just wait and see all the changes there'll be  
By the time it gets dark
