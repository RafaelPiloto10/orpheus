[Chorus]  
I've got, got the victory  
I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus  
Yes I do  
He is a mighty conqueror  
In him I will trust all my battles he'll fight  
I've got, got the victory  
I've got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus  
For me he died but he rose on the third day  
That's why I have true victory every day  
  
Truly I've been through the storm and rain  
I know everything about heartache and pain  
But God carried me through it all  
Without his protection I would surely fall  
I've been broke, without a dime to my name  
But all my bills got paid  
Because I called on Jesus' name  
You can't tell me that God isn't real  
'Cause I've got the victory  
And that's why I'm still here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not worried about material things I don't have  
I'm just blessed 'cause I know that my savior's there  
Because I know that my blessing is on the way  
I can't see it right now but I stand by faith  
I've fought many, many battles in his name  
I've held up the blood-stained banner  
And proclaimed that Jesus is the truth and the light  
Believe me when I say he will make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I got the victory, yeah  
I got the victory, yeah, yeah, yeah  
And if you got the victory, sing along with me  
Yeah, I've got the victory, yeah  
I got the victory, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Sing it with me, I've got the victory  
  
[Chorus]
