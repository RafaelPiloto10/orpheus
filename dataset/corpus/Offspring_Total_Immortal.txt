Hope unkown. Sometimes just waking is surreal.  
I walk right through the nameless ones.  
I know that hope's unknown.  
Sometimes the water feels so real.  
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning.  
This day never seems  
This pain, never.  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go.  
  
I hear them calling.  
I feel them gnawing out holes through flawless souls.  
  
So alone. Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless
ones.  
I fear that I alone fear those ceased to feel they're alone inside of this
place.  
I am the misplaced.  
This day never seems  
This pain, never.  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go.  
  
Now everything, looks familiar...  
Then every face would melt away until..  
Now everyone, do you know, I know your deception.
