You were lookin' at your mother  
So you went and told your father  
Daddy don't say nothin' he's got plenty in his past  
Changed your way of thinkin'  
So you started drinkin'  
And you got arrested for drivin' blind  
  
Take the rap, take the rap  
It's gonna break your back, it's a fact, take the rap  
  
It was lined up on the mirror  
And you just started shavin'  
Didn't know what you were smokin'  
Cigarette came from a friend  
Judge said you're delinquent  
You don't want to think it  
So you put your head down, started servin' time  
  
Take the rap, take the rap  
It's gonna break your back, take the rap  
  
Tried to talkbut I got nothin' to prove--why you want to?  
Tried to run they took away my shoes--why you want to?  
Why you want me to take the rap?  
  
Take the rap, take the rap  
It's gonna break your back, take the rap  
  
Well your damned if iron bars'll  
Keep you rottin' in a prison  
Hell is lookin' better 'cause you'll  
Never get to heaven  
See your chance and take it  
Sure you're gonna make it  
You're prepared to take it 'cause you're never gonna...  
  
Take the rap, take the rap  
It's gonna break your back, it's a fact, take the rap
