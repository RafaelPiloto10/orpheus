One hand reaches out  
And pulls a lost soul from harm  
While a thousand more go unspoken for  
And they say,  
"What good have you done by saving just this one"  
"It's like whispering a prayer  
In the fury of a storm"  
  
And I hear them saying,  
"You'll never change things.  
And no matter what you do  
It's still the same thing"  
But it's not the world that I am changing  
I do this so, this world will know  
That it will not change me  
  
This heart still believes  
That love and mercy still exist  
While all the hatreds rage  
And so many say  
"That love is all but pointless,  
in madness such as this."  
"It's like trying to stop a fire  
with the moisture of a kiss."  
  
And I hear them saying,  
"You'll never change things.  
And no matter what you do  
It's still the same thing"  
But it's not the world that I am changing  
I do this so, this world will know  
That it will not change me  
  
As long long as one heart still holds on  
Then hope is never really gone  
  
And I hear them saying,  
"You'll never change things.  
And no matter what you do  
It's still the same thing"  
But it's not the world that I am changing  
I do this so, this world we know  
That it will not change me  
  
What I do is so, this world will know  
That it will not change me
