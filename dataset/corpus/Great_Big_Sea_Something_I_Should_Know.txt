Am I leaving you tomorrow,  
I can't see  
Is this how it's going to be?  
In the morning must I go,  
So let's take a little time,  
See what's on your mind  
Is there something I should know?  
  
I thought we went through all this yesterday  
You said you were OK,  
You just had to take it slow  
I'm tired of these little games you play,  
Are you here to stay  
Is there something I should know?  
  
[Chorus]  
Is there something I should know?  
  
I think everything we've seen,  
It was just a dream  
How did we get so low?  
To leave it all behind would be obscene  
Where's your self-esteem?  
Is there something I should know?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can keep on talking,  
You know I've got all night  
But don't keep telling me,  
That everything's all right  
It's not all right.  
  
I'm leaving you tomorrow,  
Can't you see  
This is how it's got to be,  
In the morning I must go  
So let's take a little time,  
See what's on your mind  
Is there something I should know?  
  
[Chorus]
