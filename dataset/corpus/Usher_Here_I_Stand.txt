[Verse 1]  
I'm hoping that this ain't too hard to believe  
Cause baby, you're the only one for me  
I know it gets hard when I'm moving in and outta' state  
But I promise my heart for you I would save  
  
Just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how far I go  
And no matter how long it takes  
No one or nothing can change  
Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby)  
  
[Verse 2]  
You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen (My queen)  
And finally now I know just what that means (Oh yeah, yeah)  
You're the blessing that I never thought I would get  
And to the Lord I humbly bow my head  
  
Just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Hook]  
Ever since you came (Since you came along)  
It seems life (couldn't get it right)  
I found I sunk so low, that there was no way I could be found  
(Never thought love would find me)  
And when we make love (every time you give, give to me your love)  
You make feel a way I never felt,  
With no one else, and I can't help myself  
I'm telling you, that  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how far I go (yeah)  
See no matter how long it takes (yeah)  
No one or nothing, nothing baby, ever change the way I feel, I'm your man,
Listen?  
See, forever yours, yours, all yours, Here I stand (yeah)  
No matter how far I go  
And no matter how long it takes (yeah)  
No one or nothing can change  
Forever yours, I'll remain  
Here I Stand...

Can you help me?  
Anybody out there help me  
Please can you help me?  
  
Excuse me mister, I fell on hard times, I need some help  
But don't need a dime, don't turn a way, I'll wash your clothes  
If you let me stay, find your remote,  
Day after day, people walk by, I can't catch their eyes  
I Pull out my sign  
  
[Chorus]  
It says,  
Will work for love  
I will [Repeat x3]  
I'll work for love, overtime  
Baby, it says will work for love  
I will [Repeat x3]  
I'll work for love, for all my life

Anybody out there help me (does anybody out there)  
Please can you help me?  
  
Excuse me you two, got love to spare?  
Search my whole heart, it ain't none in there  
What meets a star, I'm on my last  
Don't have no love, that's OK god bless  
  
Day after day people walk by, I can't catch their eyes  
I Pull out my sign,  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I remember the day I lost my heart (hey yeah)  
Took it for granted I went too far  
Fall down, crying and beg to feel that love again  
I Hold on this sign till the very end  
Do anything  
  
I will [Repeat x3]  
I'll work for love, overtime  
Baby, it says will work for love  
I will [Repeat x3]  
I'll work for love, help me  
I will work for love
