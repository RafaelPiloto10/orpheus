You want things your way  
And I want them mine  
And now we don't know  
Just where to draw the line  
How can love survive  
If we keep choosing sides  
And who picks up the pieces  
Every time two fools collide  
  
You lay the blame on me  
And I, the blame on you  
But why do we keep finding fault  
In everything we do  
And how long can we keep right and wrongs  
So cut and dry  
And who picks up the pieces  
Every time two fools collide  
  
We can save our love  
We still have the time  
Oh, I know there must be a way  
But we still haven't tried  
To keep our hearts from breaking  
Every time two fools collide  
To keep our hearts from breaking  
Every time two fools collide
