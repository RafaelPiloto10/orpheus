Another day and another full seizure  
Another pill, you spiral down deeper  
Another cut by a surgical butcher  
It's just a way of prolonging the torture  
  
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing  
I won't say that I'm sorry  
  
I can't bring you back but I can't leave you helpless  
I'll make the pain rest in peace  
  
I'll turn off the light and  
Swallow your last breath  
So close your eyes, fall asleep  
I'll never hurt you  
I'll never hurt you  
  
The sun shines on this deadly new morning  
The church bells ring an early warning  
Your eyes shine as I turn on the motor  
The tears fall as the mercy gets closer  
  
I won't say I don't know what I'm doing  
I won't say that I'm sorry  
  
I can't bring you back but I can't leave you helpless  
I'll make the pain rest in peace  
I'll turn off the light and  
Swallow your last breath  
So close your eyes, fall asleep  
I'll never hurt you  
  
I can't bring you back but I can't leave you helpless  
I'll make the pain rest in peace  
I'll turn off the light and  
Swallow your last breath  
So close your eyes, fall asleep  
I'll never hurt you
