I met a babe in a backseat drive-in  
Back in the saddle she'd sit  
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin'  
  
She loved to chomp at the bit  
Daddy do it, ooh, just do it  
Daddy do it, please let me see  
Do it, please just do it daddy  
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy  
  
She always walks with her eyes down on her bootlace  
She lives to give it away  
She don't believe in the right time or the wrong place  
She's always liable to say  
  
(Cheese cake) Looser than her sister  
(Cheese cake) Mmm, her sugar gets me high  
She knows I can't resist her (cheese cake)  
Got my fingers in her pie (cheese cake)  
  
(Cheese cake) Sneakin' out the back door  
(Cheese cake) Rollin' down the lawn  
Everybody's kissed her (cheese cake)  
At the crack of dawn (cheese cake)
