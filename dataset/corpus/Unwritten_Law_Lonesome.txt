Well I'm here, but I don't want to stay  
Cause you're not around and I'm feeling lonely  
Same old episode for me, heading for catastrophe.  
And I can see that it's  
  
Association with the past  
So think about it  
It's like a tie that did not last  
Don't move so fast  
Don't run, cause you might find out,  
Find out I'm the one  
And I still feel lonesome  
  
Nothing's changed, it just gets rearranged  
When you come around  
So now what's your story  
You were never there for me  
So I'm going out to see  
Cause I can't see that it's  
  
Association with the past  
So think about it  
It's like a tie that did not last  
Don't move so fast  
Don't run, cause you might find out,  
Find out I'm the one  
(Yeah) And I still feel lonesome  
  
Go go go  
Yeah  
  
Now you're here  
But I don't want to stay  
Cause you weren't around  
And now you say you're sorry  
And nothing's changed  
It's just been rearranged  
So stay down, just stay down.  
  
Association with the past  
So think about it  
It's like a tie that did not last  
Don't move so fast  
Don't run, cause you might find out,  
Find out I'm the one  
And I still feel lonesome  
  
Well I'm still lonesome  
Yeah  
I'm still lonesome.
