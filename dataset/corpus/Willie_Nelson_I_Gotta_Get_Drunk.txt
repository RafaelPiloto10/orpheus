Well I gotta get drunk  
And I sure do dread it  
Cause I know just what I'm gonna do  
I'll start to spend my money  
Call everybody honey  
And wind up singing the blues  
I'll spend my whole paycheck  
On some old wreck  
And brother I can name you a few  
But I gotta get drunk  
And I sure do dread it  
Cause I know just what I'm gonna do  
  
I gotta get drunk I just can't stay sober  
There's a lot of good people in town  
Who'd like to hear me holler  
See me spend my dollars  
And I wouldn't think of lettin' 'em down  
There's a lot of doctors that tell me  
That I'd better start slowin' it down  
But there's more old drunkers  
Than there are old doctors  
So I guess we'd better have another round  
Well now I gotta get drunk  
  
Well I gotta get drunk
