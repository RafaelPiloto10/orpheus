I've gotten good at missin' her  
I practice all the time  
While I drive the Pan Am highway through  
With that cactus friend of mine  
It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by  
I can't forget her memory deep inside  
  
I dropped a bundle down in Panama  
But the loss didn't do me no good  
Spendin' cash and talkin' trash  
Don't do it like it should  
I realized I just couldn't buy her smile  
I'll keep tryin' on that Pan Am mile by mile  
  
If she'd meet me in San Salvador  
I'd buy her a drink or two  
We'd talk about our used to be  
And ride on to Peru  
The time to get it right is here and now  
If she won't I'll move on anyhow
