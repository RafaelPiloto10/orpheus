I think I have become one of the hollow men  
As I shine on the outside more these days  
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside  
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place  
I think I have become one of the hollow men  
  
I think I have become one of the lonely  
Now that everybody talks to me  
I feel I have become one of the empty  
  
Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye  
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out  
Hollow men have got you long before you realise  
  
The poison paralyses  
  
I think I have become one of a pair of men  
It's a feeling I've been having for some time  
I look down upon myself and watch my movements  
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised  
  
Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men  
Find us anywhere you look  
Come and meet our friends  
Stand us in our silly clothes  
Put our batteries in  
Line us up like fairground ducks  
Watch us grin and grin  
See the lies behind our eyes  
See the will to win  
We'll buy you and we'll sell you  
But perhaps we'll save your skin  
  
Sit quietly and listen to the breeze  
The hollow and the lonely listen too  
Sniff the air for something we can use  
  
We're tin-hard and we rattle when we're shaken
