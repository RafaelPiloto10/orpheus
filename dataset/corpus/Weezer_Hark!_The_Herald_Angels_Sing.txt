Hark! The herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled  
  
Joyful all ye nations rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With the angelic host proclaim  
Christ is born in Bethlehem  
  
Hark! The herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
  
Mild He lays His glory by  
Born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
  
Hail the Heaven born Prince of Peace  
Hail the Son of Righteousness  
Light and life to all He brings  
Risen with healing in His wings  
  
Hark! The herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King
