There's been so many girls that I've known  
I've made so many cry, and still I wonder why  
Here comes a little girl, I see her walking down the street  
She's all by herself, I try to knock her off her feet  
  
'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break  
This heart of stone, oh no, no, this heart of stone  
  
What's different about her I don't really know  
No matter how I try, I just can't make her cry  
  
'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break  
This heart of stone, oh no, no, this heart of stone  
  
Don't keep on looking that same old way  
If you try acting sad, you'll only make me glad  
Better listen little girl, if you going walking down the street  
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet  
  
'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break  
This heart of stone, oh no, no, you'll never break this heart of stone darling  
  
No no this heart of stone  
You'll never break it darling  
You won't break this heart of stone oh no no no  
You better go, you better go home  
'Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone  
You better, you better drive on home
