Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker  
  
What you give, you get back  
As long as I can think I've been  
Running to be free  
There's not a place that could have been too far  
Had nothing but a bag of dreams  
And this old guitar  
A couple of songs to play for you an me  
There's so much love inside of me  
That wants to be released  
I can't help it so I give it all away  
What you give you get it back  
So take my love just because it's all I have  
Take my heart take my soul  
I just never want it back  
As long as I've been living  
I've had music in my veins  
I can't go on without it anymore  
My suitcase is a wanderer  
That takes me I believe  
For a walk right across your heart  
There's so much love inside of you  
That wants to be released  
And all you gotta do is let it go  
What you give you get back  
So take my love just because it's all I have  
Take my heart take my soul  
I just never want it back  
Cause the love you give, is the love you'll get  
There's so much love inside of me  
That wants to be released  
I can't help it so I gave it all away  
What you give you get back  
So take my love just because it's all I have  
What you give you get back  
So take my love just because it's all I have  
Take my heart take my soul  
I just never want it back  
Cause your love, your love is all I have  
All I have  
Love is all we have  
All I have
