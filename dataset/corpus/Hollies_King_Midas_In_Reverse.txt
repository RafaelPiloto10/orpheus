If you could only see me.  
And know exactly were I am.  
You wouldn't want to be me,  
Oh I can assure you of that.  
  
I'm not the guy to run with,  
Cause I'll pull you off the line.  
I'll break you and destroy you  
Give time.  
  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's king Midas in Reverse.  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's King Midas in Reverse.  
  
It's plain to see it's hopeless,  
Goin' on the way we are.  
So even though I loose you,  
You'll be better off by far.  
  
He's not the man to hold your trust,  
Everything he touches turns to dust in his hands.  
Nothing he can do is right, he'd even like to sleep at night, but he can't.  
  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
  
I wish someone would find me,  
And help me gain control.  
Before I loose my reason,  
And my soul  
  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's King Midas in reverse.  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's king Midas in Reverse.  
  
He's King Midas with a curse  
(all he touches turns to dust)  
He's Kind Midas in Reverse.  
(all he touches turns to dust)  
He's King Midas with a curse,  
(all he touches turns to dust)  
He's King Midas in Reverse
