Every day it seems my smile's a little harder  
And every day, I seem to laugh a little less  
Living this way, it seems my sky's a little darker  
You went away and left me lonely in success  
  
(can't you see I'm falling apart) (repeat)  
  
Can't you see what's happenin' to me  
  
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is  
Understand, you may just save me from despair  
Watch this man, you'll see he can't stop what he has started  
Take this hand, you'll see right now there's no-one there  
  
(can't you see I'm falling apart)  
You laugh at me as I fall  
(can't you see I'm falling apart)  
Just tell me, tell me, give me one good reason  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But instead I watch you die  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
Tell me why an I so blue.
