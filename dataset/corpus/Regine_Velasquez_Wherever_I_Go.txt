I never get tired of loving you  
I've thinking of you each night  
You're always on my mind each passing day  
You're in this heart of mine  
You, I've been loving you for so long  
You've been the life behind my song  
You're the reason why I keep going on and on  
  
(Wherever I go) Go  
You're in my soul  
(Wherever I go) Go  
I keep your picture in my mind  
When I close my eyes  
I always see your smile  
Wherever I go  
  
I don't mind the distance  
Because you are always in my heart  
Darling I'd see that when I close my eyes  
There you are  
  
You, I've been loving you for so long  
You've been the life behind my song  
You're the reason why I keep going on and on  
  
(Wherever I go) Go  
You're in my soul  
(Wherever I go)  
I keep your picture in my mind  
When I close my eyes  
I always see your smile  
Wherever I go  
  
Wherever I go  
(Wherever I go)  
You're in my soul  
(Wherever I go)  
I keep your picture in my mind  
When I close my eyes  
I always see your smile  
Wherever I go  
  
(Wherever I go)  
(You're in my soul)  
Wherever I go  
(I keep your picture) in my mind  
When I close my eyes  
I always see your smile  
Wherever I go
