Oh it's Christmas  
Oh ah  
I'm so glad that you came my way  
From a million stars  
Here you are  
I swear your love is mine  
Somehow I knew that you were made for me  
I can't believe that my wish came true  
I'll never let ya go baby  
  
[Chorus]  
People are celebrating all throughout the world  
And that's what we gonna do tonight  
'Cause we got so much so much love to share  
Oh it's Christmas  
And we'll share a love just like we did last year  
Oh, it's Christmas  
And you know I'm gonna be right here  
And still my heart belongs to you and only you  
Merry Christmas darlin'  
Let us share the joy of love tonight  
Girl, when tonight's may come and go  
We're still dancing slow  
Can't you hear my song?  
The song I sing for you  
Yes, I sing for you  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
I'm gonna be right there for you  
You should know by now it's true  
I'm not gonna leave  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
And I wish you such a nice Christmas  
And a merry Christmas to all  
Merry Christmas to the world
