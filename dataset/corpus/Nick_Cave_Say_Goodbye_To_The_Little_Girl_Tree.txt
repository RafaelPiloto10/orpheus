O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To the little girl tree.  
This wall I built around you  
Is made out of stone-lies.  
O little girl the truth would be  
An axe in thee.  
O father look to your daughter  
Brick of grief and stricken morter.  
With this ring  
This silver hoop of wire  
I bind your maiden mainstream  
Just to keep you as a child.  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To my little girl tree.  
How fast your candy bones  
Reached out for me.  
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones  
Crying out for me.  
O you know that I must say goodbye.  
O goodbye.  
Even though you will betray me  
The very minute that I leave.  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree.  
I rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots  
Into her laden boughs  
And amongst her roping limbs  
Like a swollen neck vein branching  
Into smaller lesser veins  
That must all just sing and say goodbye  
And let her blossom veils fly.  
Her velvet gown.  
Down down down.  
Down down down.  
Down down down and goodbye.  
For you know that I must say goodbye.  
To a rhythm softly tortured  
Of a motion back and forth.  
That's a rhythm sweetly tortured  
O that's the rhythm of the orchard.  
And you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree.  
O goodbye.  
Yes goodbye.  
For you know that I must die.  
Down down down.  
Down down down.  
Down down down and goodbye.  
For you know that I must die.  
Yes you know that I must die.  
O-o you know that I must die.
