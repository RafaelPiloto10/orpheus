Come down  
  
Hey kid, I'm talkin' to you  
What am I supposed to do  
You know that you're something special  
That's something you already knew  
Hey kid, got something to say  
But you won't listen anyway  
I am only tryin' to help you  
But you get further every day  
  
We think your head is getting  
Bigger and bigger and bigger  
  
Hey kid, some good advice  
To bring your britches down to size  
Some modesty would suit you better  
So why don't you give it a try  
  
Hey kid ego  
With your head above the clouds  
Hey kid ego  
Come down  
  
Hey kid, you're Mr. IT  
Inch by inch a little bit  
Stepping on the little people  
Like you don't even give a shit  
Hey kid, you have it all  
Standing proud on top of the world  
Don't you know the bigger they come  
The harder they must all fall  
  
We think your head is getting  
Bigger and bigger and bigger  
We think you should be taught  
Some manners, manners, manners  
  
Hey kid, some good advice  
To bring your britches down to size  
Some modesty would suit you better  
So why don't you give it a try
