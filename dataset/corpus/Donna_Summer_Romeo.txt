My baby wears his heart on his sleeve  
He wears a look on his face that says please please please  
Love it  
Everything he flaunts love it  
Everything he vaunts I just  
Can't hesitate when he wants what he wants  
  
Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
  
Last night he calls me on the telephone  
You know at two in the morning I just want to sleep on  
But he's got a way with words and  
He's got a way with charm  
And at three in the morning he's back into my arms  
  
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's my Romeo... oh, oh... oh, oh, oh  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's my are-O-M-E-O, Romeo  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's my Romeo oh, oh... oh, oh, oh  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's mine  
  
My my Romeo, my my Romeo, my my Romeo, my my Romeo  
  
He looks so good the girls stop and stare  
But I soon wanna look with his double dark hair  
I'm not gonna let him go  
I'm not taking any chance  
It's a one in million mad mad romance  
  
Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's my Romeo oh, oh... oh, oh, oh  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's my are-O-M-E-O, Romeo  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's my Romeo oh, oh... oh, oh, oh  
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy  
He's mine, Romeo  
My my Romeo, my my Romeo  
He's my Romeo  
My my Romeo  
He's my Romeo  
My my Romeo, he's my Romeo  
My Romeo...
