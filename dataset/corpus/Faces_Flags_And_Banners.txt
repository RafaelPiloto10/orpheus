Last night, I was woken by my cry  
Had a dream just as plain as you and I  
Saw the morning sun on a woodland in the spring  
Still hear the echo crashing through the trees  
Oh, when I saw you down, I fell upon my knees  
  
You and I we were wearing Southern grey  
I called to you, but I used another name  
I beat the ground, and I cried out in your pain  
Through a scarlet door I watched you slipping away  
And your brother's helpless prayers were all in vain  
  
Last night, I was woken by my cry
