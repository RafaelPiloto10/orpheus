Infatuation, she's a fatal attraction  
Hang around, screw up my mind  
I hope I've seen her for the very last time  
  
(Dangers of drinking), but I don't want to die  
Got to leave this cycle behind  
I hope I've seen her for the very last time  
  
And I can't wait 'til tomorrow  
I can't wait another day  
I can't wait 'til tomorrow  
Tomorrow she goes away - ay, hay  
  
Over my shoulder, I keep looking back  
I feel a presence following me  
So I know I'll never be free  
  
And I can't wait 'til tomorrow  
I can't wait another day  
I can't wait 'til tomorrow  
Tomorrow she goes away - ay, hay  
  
Over my shoulder, I keep looking back
