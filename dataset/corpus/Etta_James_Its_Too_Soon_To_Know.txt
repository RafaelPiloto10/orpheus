Does he love me?  
It's too soon to know  
Can I believe him  
When he tells me so?  
  
And is he fooling?  
Is this all a game?  
Am I the fire or  
Just another flame?  
  
A one sided love  
Would break my heart  
He may be just acting  
And playing a part  
  
If he don't love me  
Let him tell me so  
And I, I can't hold him  
If he wants to go  
  
And though, though  
I'll cry when he's gone  
And I won't die and I'll live on  
If it's so, it's too soon  
Way too soon to know  
  
Does he love me?  
Can I believe him?  
  
And though, I'll cry  
Though, I'll cry when he's gone  
And I won't die and I'll live on  
If it's so, it's too soon  
Way too soon to know
