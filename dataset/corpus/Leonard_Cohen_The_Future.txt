Give me back my broken night  
My mirrored room, my secret life  
It's lonely here,  
There's no one left to torture  
Give me absolute control  
Over every living soul  
And lie beside me, baby,  
That's an order!  
  
Give me crack and anal sex  
Take the only tree that's left  
And stuff it up the hole  
In your culture  
Give me back the berlin wall  
Give me stalin and st paul  
I've seen the future, brother  
It is murder.  
  
Things are going to slide, slide in all directions  
Won't be nothing  
Nothing you can measure anymore  
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world  
Has crossed the threshold  
And it has overturned  
The order of the soul  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
  
You don't know me from the wind  
You never will, you never did  
I'm the little jew  
Who wrote the bible  
I've seen the nations rise and fall  
I've heard their stories, heard them all  
But love's the only engine of survival  
Your servant here, he has been told  
To say it clear, to say it cold:  
It's over, it ain't going  
Any further  
And now the wheels of heaven stop  
You feel the devil's riding crop  
Get ready for the future:  
It is murder.  
  
Things are going to slide  
  
There'll be the breaking of the ancient  
Western code  
Your private life will suddenly explode  
There'll be phantoms  
There'll be fires on the road  
And the white man dancing  
You'll see a woman  
Hanging upside down  
Her features covered by her fallen gown  
And all the lousy little poets  
Coming round  
Tryin' to sound like charlie manson  
And the white man dancin'  
  
Give me back the berlin wall  
Give me stalin and st paul  
Give me christ  
Or give me hiroshima  
Destroy another fetus now  
We don't like children anyhow  
I've seen the future, baby  
It is murder.  
  
Things are going to slide  
  
When they said repent repent
