Passion and love and sex and money  
Violence, religion, injustice and death  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Girls, boys, art, pleasure  
Girls, boys, art, pleasure  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Food, cars, travel

Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Armani, Armani, A-A-Armani, cinque  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh

Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Now you've gone, I'm all alone  
My heart is broken and I don't wanna go home  
You know it's all over, you're out of luck  
You feel so low you wanna self-destruct  
I needed you and you loved me too  
But now I don't know what I'm gonna do  
But life moves on, I'm talking history  
And now I've got to find someone who'll dance with me  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
You, you were my lover  
You were my hope, you were my dreams, my life  
My passion, my love, my sex and my money  
My violence, religion, injustice and death  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh  
Paninaro, paninaro, oh oh oh
