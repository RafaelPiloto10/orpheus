Make of our hands, one hand  
Make of our hearts, one heart  
Make of our vows, one last vow  
Only death will part us now  
Make of our lives, one life  
Day after day, one life  
Now it begins, now we start  
One hand, one heart  
Even death won't part us now  
  
There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together with time to spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
Some day, somewhere  
  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us  
A time and place for us  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, some day  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us  
A time and a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, some day  
Somewhere  
  
I feel pretty, oh so pretty  
I feel pretty, oh so pretty
