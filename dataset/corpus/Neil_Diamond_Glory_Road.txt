Wearin' my high boots,  
Got all my world lies here in a sack  
Looking for something,  
Knowing that it ain't here where I'm at  
Ain't looking back  
I'm comin',  
Ride by thumbin',  
Get by bummin'  
I'm on my way  
  
Friend, have you seen glory road  
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,  
And I know glory road's waiting for me  
  
Caught me a pick-up  
Down from Seattle through to L.A.  
Seems like those folks  
Go chasin' a new star every day  
Ain't gonna stay  
In Nevada, through Wyomin',  
Colorado I'm on my way  
  
Friend, have you seen glory road  
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,  
And I know glory road's waiting for me  
  
Met so many others  
Wanted to know which way to go  
Louisiana, New York City  
They wanted the answer  
They'd ask of me.  
Friend, have you seen glory road?  
Say, friend, I got a heavy load  
And I know glory road's waiting for me  
Rest my load,  
Now I know glory road won't set me free
