Nuclear arms in the Middle East  
Israel is attacking the Iraqis  
The Syrians are mad at the Lebanese  
And Baghdad does whatever she please  
Looks like another threat to world peace  
For the envoy  
  
Things got hot in El Salvador  
C-I-A got caught and couldn't do no more  
He's got diplomatic immunity  
He's got a lethal weapon that nobody sees  
Looks like another threat to world peace  
For the envoy  
Send the envoy  
Send the envoy  
  
Whenever there's a crisis  
The President sends his envoy in  
Guns in Damascus  
Oh, Jerusalem  
  
Nuclear arms in the Middle East  
Israel is attacking the Iraqis  
The Syrians are mad at the Lebanese  
And Baghdad do whatever she please  
Looks like another threat to world peace  
For the envoy  
Send the envoy  
Send for me
