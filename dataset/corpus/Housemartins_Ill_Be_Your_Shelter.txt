In times when you're troubled  
Seems more than you can affoard  
And you feel, you feel you need a friend  
Someone to share the load  
  
And when your skies grow cloudy  
I want you to know got a friend that's true  
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm  
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do  
  
When your dreams are scattered  
Just like the wind blown sand  
And you feel, you feel you need a friend  
I'll be there, reach out your hand  
  
And when the tempest is raging  
I want you to know got a friend that's true  
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm  
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do  
  
I'll see you through your bad times  
I'll see you through your fears  
I'll see you through your hang ups  
Honey I'll dry all your tears  
  
And when the tempest is raging  
I want you to know got a friend that's true  
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm  
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do  
  
I will see you through, I will see you through  
I will see you through, I will see you through  
  
When my load got heavy, did you see me through  
When my load got to hard to bear, did you see me through  
What would you do, what would you do  
What would you do, what would you do  
  
If you're living on the dole and there's no sugar in your bowl  
All you need to do is give a little knock  
Don't despair he'll be there with his loving and his care  
Marx will work for us right around the clock  
  
He's alright, he's alright  
He's alright, he's alright
