It's the third thatched roof on the right  
Right beside crystal blue water  
First wave of the day  
Almost got away but my sail board caught her.  
  
Funny, when you called I was thinking how good it'd be to see you again.  
The key's in the conch shell, come on in.  
  
Been here bout a month  
Not doing much of nothing at all  
  
Dodging man o wars  
Man it's hard to get bored when you're having a ball  
  
Make yourself at home, there's a good chance I'll be gone reeling on in  
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in.  
  
Don't bring nothing but that sunshine smile  
Come on baby stay a while, stay a while.  
  
My favorite bar's in view  
Work there a day or two just to cover my tab  
Other than that, it ain't cost me a dime for the time I've had  
The only thing I need is some company from where have you been?  
  
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in.  
Make yourself at home, there's a good chance I'll be gone reeling on in  
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in.
