I'm trapped here as my senses bleed  
I can't recall which things I need  
You show up late and stumble in  
Unsure if you are still Corrine (??)  
  
My captive gaze inside your eyes  
Reveal a thing you've tried to hide  
Attempting to record this view  
Reflections drive me out of you  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
But long before this scene concludes  
The end I'm seeking still eludes  
My every effort to apply  
My will to moments passing by  
  
But everytime we say goodbye  
The pain I can't identify  
Reveals to me the hidden door  
That leads to several moments more  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Time for the meatstick,  
Bury the meatstick,  
Take out the meatstick time  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
Whoa, shocks my brain  
  
Holy shit, that's making all kinds of rules  
I'm not even going to go there  
Hey just for a second, I'll just go for a second.  
Oh, meatstick? Ah.. I don't know.. On a string?  
Time for the meatstick?  
Bury meatstick  
Bury meatstick time?  
Oh meatstick!!  
Hey, that song could be the next cha cha  
  
Oooh
