Blue Guitar  
Blue guitar,  
Fortune of my ways  
Making of my days.  
New chord,  
Counting up the ways  
Happiness is lazy.  
  
If you don't know the song,  
If you can't put the words to the tune,  
Tell the rhyme from the reason,  
What should it matter  
To the fool or the dreamer?  
  
New hope,  
Travellers in a storm,  
Finding love is warm.  
New day,  
The world has just begun,  
Our eyes have seen the sun.  
  
If you don't know the way,  
If you can't see the wood for the trees,  
Taste the wine from the water,  
Well, what should it matter,  
To the fool or the dreamer?
