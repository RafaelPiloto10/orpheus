She's my best friend, certainly not your average girl  
Yeah, she's my best friend  
She understands me when I'm feeling  
Dow-dow-dow-dow-dow-down  
You know, it sure hurts to be that way  
Dow-dow-dow-dow-dow-down  
You know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella  
Here's to Mullberry-Jane  
She made jam when she came  
Somebody cut off her feet  
Now jelly rolls in the street  
  
If you want to see me  
Well, honey you know that I 'm not around  
But if you want to hear me  
Why don't you just turn around  
I'm by the window where the light is  
  
She' my best friend  
Certainly not just like your average dog or car  
She's my best friend  
She understands me when I'm feeling dow-dow-dow-dow-dow-down  
You know, it sure hurts to be that way  
Dow-dow-dow-dow-dow-down  
You know, it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella  
Let's hear one for Newspaper Joe  
He caught his hand in the door  
Dropped his teeth on the floor  
They say, hey, now jokers  
That's the way the news goes  
  
If you want to see, yeah, see me  
Well, baby, you know that I 'm not around  
But if you want to feel, yeah, feel me  
Why don't you just turn around  
I'm by the window where the light is fake  
She's my best friend, she's my best friend  
Tell me baby now  
She's my best friend, oh, she's my, she's my best friend  
She's my best friend ...
