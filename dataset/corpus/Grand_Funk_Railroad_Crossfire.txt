You win or lose a penny.  
What does it matter any.  
We all are gamblers just by livin'.  
  
You hold a hopeless token.  
Even though your heart is broken.  
'cause you've nothin' left for the love you're givin'.  
  
(chorus)  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire ... of love.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire ... of love.  
  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
  
You played your hand at poker.  
But do you understand this joker.  
Who shot down all your hopes and dreams.  
  
Why do they always hurt you.  
You think they won't but you know they're sure to.  
Can't trust a soul no more it seems.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
  
You caught your love red handed.  
Been stuck up like a bandit.  
Crossfire.  
  
Low down dirty underhanded.  
Just ain't right can't understand it.  
Crossfire.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.
