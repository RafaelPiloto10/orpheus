Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me?  
Little alter boy, for I have gone astray  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
  
Little alter boy, I wonder could you ask your lord  
Ask him, alter boy, to take my sins away  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
  
Lift up your voice and send a prayer above  
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love  
Now I know my life has been all wrong  
Lift up your voice and help a sinner be strong  
  
Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me?  
Could you tell our lord I'm gonna change my ways today?  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
Little alter boy please let me hear you pray
