[Chorus]  
I know you got a man, man, man  
But tell me what your man, man, man  
Got to do with me, me, me  
Uh oh uh oh oh  
Got to do with me, me, me  
Uh oh uh oh oh  
I know you got a girl, girl, girl  
But tell me what your girl, girl, girl  
Got to do with me, me, me  
Uh oh uh oh oh  
Got to do with me, me, me  
Uh oh uh oh oh  
  
Listen,  
I know you got a man, but your man ain't Luda  
So please don't let him fool ya  
Cos the nigga don't really know how to do ya  
Who's your daddy rolling all up in the caddy  
Sun roof top with the diamond in the back  
Coming to get some of the bomb in the sack  
Like a bomb in Iraq I'ma come and attack  
Every inch of your body after the after party  
And then on to the hotel lobby riding me like a Ducatti  
Faster than a Bugatti  
I'm like whoa Kimosabe  
Good golly shorty a freak or she been practicing Pilates  
I'm probably just stripping tongue sk-skipping like a track broke  
But if she think I'm fronting just wait til she see my back stroke  
Haa, I be your side piece but what's our future plans  
Cause I be on ya like damn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, ok, ok, so that's your mans and 'em  
I ain't tellin' you to cancel him  
Do do your thing, look shorty I gotta respect your answer 'em  
Them there's your boyfriend, I just wanna be your toy friend  
Your other, other man  
Not not your lo-lo-lover man, undercover man  
How many rubber man's would it take for you  
Lil' mama to be apart of my plan  
What do you need in advance,  
I can see both of us showing in France  
I can look back at your thong in my hand  
Louis Vuitton no more Donna Karen  
Couple of stacks so what is you saying  
Like Denzel Washington "My Man"  
I don't wanna hear no mo' more bout him  
What it gotta do with me you grown ass woman  
I'm a grown ass man so we both know a lot about the birds and the bee's  
Hold on shorty lets conversate, conjugate, constipate  
Get stuck on each other, you coming up outta your lingerie, hey  
I know you got a man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nada, nada, not a damn thing  
He wouldn't know what to do if he tried it  
And I ain't hating, you need some room to breathe and  
I can be your ventilation  
You need a lil' lovin' just a lil' stimulation  
A hug a lil' kissing and then a lil' penetration  
Give it to you like you never had it before  
And you ain't never gon' think about his ass again  
Lips, hips, eyes, thighs here I'm gon' have to give that ass a ten  
And they can get a five even though one of them kinda fine  
But ain't none of them got nothing on you, you  
So let's go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine  
Later on tell me what we gon' do d,o  
We gon' bump and we gon' grind so good it should be a crime  
And next time tell your friends to come too, too.  
  
[Chorus]
