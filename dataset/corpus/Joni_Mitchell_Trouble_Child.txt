Up in a sterilized room  
Where they let you be lazy  
Knowing your attitude's all wrong  
And you got to change  
And that's not easy  
Dragon shining with all values known  
Dazzling you-keeping you from your own  
Where is the lion in you to defy him  
When you're this weak  
And this spacey...  
  
So what are you going to do about it  
You can't live life and you can't leave it  
Advice and religion-you can't take it  
You can't seem to believe it  
The peacock is afraid to parade  
You're under the thumb of the maid  
You really can't give love in this condition  
Still you know how you need it  
  
They open and close you  
Then they talk like they know you  
They don't know you  
They're friends and they're foes too  
Trouble child  
Breaking like the waves at Malibu  
  
So why does it come as such a shock  
To know you really have no one  
Only a river of changing faces  
Looking for an ocean  
They trickle through your leaky plans  
Another dream over the dam  
And you're lying in some room  
Feeling like your right to be human  
Is going over too  
Well some are going to knock you  
And some'll try to clock you  
You know it's really hard  
To talk sense to you  
Trouble child  
Breaking like the waves at Malibu
