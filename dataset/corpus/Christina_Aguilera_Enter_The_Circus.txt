Ladies and gentlemen  
Boys and girls  
Step right up, step right up  
Come closer, you won't believe your eyes  
Behind this curtain  
Witness something you've never seen before  
Heard before, dreamt before  
The most amazing show on earth  
  
La la la la la la la  
It's the most amazing show on earth  
La la la la la la la  
  
Do you want to be widely entertained  
People to know your name?  
Do you crave fame?  
Well, they say things aren't always what they seem to be  
Even your greatest fantasies  
You won't believe your eyes  
Won't even recognize  
The wonderment that lies  
Behind the shimmer and the lights  
  
Is it true what they say?  
Is it all just fun and games?  
Or is there more behind the makeup  
And the faces full of paint?  
  
I ask you, do you want to come and play?  
Ha ha ha ha  
Get the world to come and play  
Ha ha ha ha  
  
So sit back, relax, fasten your seat belts  
It's going to be a bumpy ride to the other side
