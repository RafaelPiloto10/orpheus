You've had your troubles Israel  
I've seen them all  
But you put the writing on the wall  
Israel Israel yeah  
  
You know I've seen you fall so many times  
I've cried for you and that's a crime  
Israel Israel Israel  
  
Where there's sand  
Where there's beautiful sand yeah  
You know you got a kind of feeling  
That's just grand  
Take me into your arms  
Let me be with you  
Israel Israel Israel  
  
I like the smiles up on your people's faces  
They make you feel warm embraces  
And I want that kind of smile  
that kind of smile  
Israel you make the whole world think about you  
And if they don't they'll find a reason  
to shout about Israel Israel  
  
You're the only one Israel Israel  
Tell me all about it!  
Tell me all about it  
Tell me all about it  
Oh take me into your arms  
And make me feel your goodness  
Be with me Israel  
Hey hey hey hey  
Oh oh oh  
Take me into your arms  
Let me hold hold you to myself  
Oh I want to Israel  
  
Israel Oh take me back into into your arms  
Israel Israel Israel Israel  
Israel
