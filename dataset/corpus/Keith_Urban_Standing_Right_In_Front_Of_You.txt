Out on the street corner  
Just like every morning I sit here  
And I watch you walk my way  
And even though I don't know you  
As you get closer I swear I feel  
My heart start racing, aching  
Maybe it's in my mind  
And maybe I'm only dreaming  
And I swear you catch my eye  
As you walk on by  
Oh why you gotta leave me so blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby why can't you see  
That I'm the only one for you  
You could search the world over  
But you'll never find another so true  
'Cause if you're looking for love  
I'm standing right in front of you  
  
(I'm standing right in front of you)  
  
I bet your heart, like mine  
Has been broken by someone  
We never should have given it to (oh no)  
So we put up a wall to keep from falling so hard  
It's so sad  
'Cause there's such good love inside  
And I've been hoping that I might find  
Someone who feels the same way  
Someone to share my life  
On this beautiful ride together  
We could see it all through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Standing right in front of you)  
  
So this morning I'm just going to walk up, and say hello to you  
'Cause if given a choice between love and being alone  
I know which one  
I know which one I choose  
And give me a chance  
I'd be a better man for you (I believe I would)  
And open your heart girl  
Let me make your dreams come true  
  
You can search the world over  
But I can take it to the moon  
'Cause if you're looking for love  
I'm standing right in front of you (yes I am)  
Standing right in front of you  
(Standing right in front of you)  
Open your eyes, (I'm standing right in front of you)  
Just give me a chance baby  
(I'm standing right in front of you)
