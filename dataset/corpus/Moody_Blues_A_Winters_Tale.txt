The nights are colder now  
Maybe I should close the door  
And anyway the snow has covered all your footsteps  
And I can follow you no more  
The fire still burns at night  
The memories are warm and clear  
But everybody knows  
It's hard to be alone this time of year  
It was only a winter's tale  
Just another winter's tale  
And why should the world take notice  
Of one more love that's failed?  
A love that can never be  
Though it meant a lot to you and me  
On a world wide scale  
We're just another winter's tale  
While I stand alone  
A bell is ringing far away  
I wonder if you're here  
I wonder if you're listening  
I wonder where you are today  
Good luck, I wish you well  
For all that wishes may be worth  
I hope that love and strength  
Are with you for the length  
Of your time on earth  
It was only a winter's tale  
Just another winter's tale  
And why should the world take notice  
Of one more love that's failed?  
It's a love that can never be  
Though it meant a lot to you and me  
On a world wide scale  
We're just another winter's tale  
It was only a winter's tale  
Just another winter's tale  
And why should the world take notice  
Of one more love that's failed?  
It's a love that can never be  
Though it meant a lot to you and me  
On a world wide scale  
We're just another winter's tale  
We're just another winter's tale
