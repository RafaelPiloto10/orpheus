Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight,  
We're happy tonight,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
And gone away is the bluebird,  
But here to stay, stay, stay is the new bird  
He sings a love song,  
As we go along,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman,  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
We'll say: No man,  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town.  
  
Later on, we'll conspire,  
As we dream by the fire babe  
We'll face unafraid,  
All the plans that we've made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
Later on, we'll conspire,  
As we dream by the fire babe  
We'll face unafraid,  
All the plans that we made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
We'll face unafraid,  
All the plans that we made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
To face unafraid,  
All the plans that we made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.
