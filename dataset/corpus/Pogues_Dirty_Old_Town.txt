I met my love by the gas works wall  
Dreamed a dream by the old canal  
Kissed a girl by the factory wall  
Dirty old town, Dirty old town  
  
Clouds a drifting across the moon  
Cats a prowling on their beat  
Spring's a girl in the street at night  
Dirty old town, Dirty old town  
  
I Heard a siren from the docks  
Saw a train set the night on fire  
I Smelled the spring on the smoky wind  
Dirty old town, Dirty old town  
  
I'm gonna make me a good sharp axe  
Shining steel tempered in the fire  
Will chop you down like an old dead tree  
Dirty old town, Dirty old town  
  
Dirty old town, Dirty old town
