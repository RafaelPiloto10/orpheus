This is a man's world  
This is a man's world  
But it would be nothing  
Nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
You see man made the cars  
To take us over the road  
Man made the train  
To carry the heavy load  
  
Man made the electric lights  
To take us out of the dark  
Man made the boat for the water  
Like Noah made the ark  
  
This is a man's man's man's world  
But it would be nothing  
Nothing without a woman or a girl  
  
Man thinks of little baby girls  
And the baby boys  
Man make them happy  
'Cause man makes them toys  
  
And after man make everything  
Everything he can  
You know that man makes money  
To buy from other man  
  
This is a man's world  
But it would be nothing, nothing  
Not one little thing  
Without a woman or a girl  
  
He's lost in the wilderness  
He's lost in the bitterness  
He's lost, lost and
