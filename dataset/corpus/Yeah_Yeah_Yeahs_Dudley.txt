Hot cold season gonna sink in my sweat  
No one isn't ever gonna make it there yet  
If you can't even cope with it  
Then you'll pass me by  
You'll take it over  
And make it mine  
  
Fast slow living is a holding me back  
Wishing that my baby never told me that  
I can't even cope to make it last  
Then you'll pass me by  
You'll take it over  
And make it mine  
  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
Then you want it a want it a want it again  
  
My dear, you've been used  
I'm breaking the news  
Love nearly beat us  
I'm thinking like you  
I'm thinking of you  
Love follows near us  
Can love really steer us?  
Oh can it be true?  
Oh can it be true?  
  
Lost all reason after playing your game  
Better quit staring cause your looking the same  
I can't even cope to make a change  
Then you'll pass me by  
You'll take it over  
And make it mine  
  
Use me up,  
Use me up,  
Taper off and I'm had
