You breathe... I breathe you in  
I like a lot where you been  
I make...you break the rules  
You got e-rot-tickle cool  
Give a little bit get a little bit take it for a ride yeah  
When you push love so far away  
It eats you up inside  
There's a girl living under my skin  
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin  
And I think she's the reason  
That it's open brokenhearted season  
There's a girl  
There's a girl  
I know you know you are  
You are the ooh in la la  
Blow a little kiss know a little bliss get a little high...yeah yeah  
And I can't get you outta me 'cause you're too deep inside  
There's a girl living under my skin  
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin  
And I think she's the reason  
That's it's open broken hearted season  
Do it do it do it...  
You could spend your whole lifetime  
(Under my skin)  
You could be never more mine  
(Under my skin)  
There's a girl...there's a girl  
There's a girl...there's a girl  
Get a little bit give a little bit get a little high...yeah yeah  
When you push love so far away  
It eats you up inside  
There's a girl living under my skin  
There's this girl and she's wearing me thin  
And I think she's the reason  
That it's open broken hearted season  
There's a girl there's a girl...ya ya ya ya  
There's a girl there's a girl...ya ya ya ya  
And I think she's the reason  
That it's open broken hearted season  
There's a girl there's a girl...ya ya ya ya  
There's a girl there's a girl...ya ya ya ya  
There's a girl there's a girl...ya ya ya ya  
There's a girl there's a girl...ya ya ya  
There's a girl there's a girl
