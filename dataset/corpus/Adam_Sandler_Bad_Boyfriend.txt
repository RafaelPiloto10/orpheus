Why don't you pick up after your done?  
I'm not your slave  
I'm not your mother  
I'm not your maid  
I mean I've got a life too  
So fuck you!  
  
Why can't you be nicer to my friend?  
They're gonna be here soon  
Last time they were here  
You just sat in the bedroom  
Friday you went out with your fat friend Lou  
Fuck you!  
  
Why don't you ever ask about my Chinese cooking class?  
I only took it 'cause you like moo shu  
Fuck you!  
  
I'm sorry honey, about the way I've been acting lately  
Fuck you!  
  
Don't be like that, we'll visit your mom when I get some time off  
Fuck you!  
  
I had the beer at work, for God's sake  
Fuck you!  
  
By the way, would it be cool to go golfing tomorrow?  
Fuck you!  
  
I was just kidding, I want to hang out with you  
Why don't you ever take me to a play?  
Or a museum?  
There's an art gallery two blocks away  
And we've never been there  
We always do what you want to do  
Fuck you!  
  
You didn't notice  
I got new throw pillows for the sofa  
You didn't notice I had the kitched painted blue  
Why don't you notice all those guys looking at me?  
You take me for granted  
Do you know there's a guy at work that always asks me out to lunch?  
I always try to look my best and you should too  
Fuck you!  
  
Why won't I ever get out of this relationship?  
You're such a jerk  
The only thing you do right is  
Tell me that you love me  
Well, I guess I love you too  
But fuck you!  
Seriously
