Fuck off  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it therrreee  
  
I never went to college, I ain't got no skills  
I got hair to my shoulders and a bottle of pills  
I got bills stacked up like a turkey club  
I blew my last dime drinkin at the local pub  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins  
I live, each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I'll pay  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it therrrreeee  
  
Rock, rock y'all  
(Rock y'all)  
To the beat y'all  
(Ah, to the beat y'all)  
Check it out y'all  
(Check it out y'all)  
You can't stop y'all  
(You can't stop y'all)  
Rock, rock y'all  
(Rock y'all)  
To the beat y'all  
(Ah, to the beat y'all)  
Check it out y'all  
(Check it out y'all)  
You come alive y'all  
(Alive y'all)  
Come on  
  
I never felt at home, although I grew up loved  
I got a junkies mind in a ramblin man's blood  
Got a flood full of thoughts that's caught in a dam  
Somedays I'm gone, but that's where I am  
I'm fit to slip another rippin rhyme  
I'm so ahead of the game, I feel left behind  
Another dime to boost, I got boots of lead  
Hope I live to see this virus spread  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins I live  
Each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I pay  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it there  
  
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
