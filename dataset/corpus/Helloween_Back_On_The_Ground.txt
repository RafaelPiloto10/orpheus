We can race over the mountains  
Sail over the spheres  
We can ride under the oceans  
But we can't fight our fear  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
We believe to govern nature  
Find ways to lengthen our life  
And we go through digital stages  
Still the children cry  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
I will sing it loud  
Won't you put your feet back on the ground?  
We explore the existence of aliens  
Try to conquer the space  
We refine nuclear science  
Still to die in the haze  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
I will sing it loud  
Won't you put your feet back on the ground?  
Something's wrong with the world today  
Do you know what it is?  
The planet could be a better place  
If we spot the miss  
But I guess I would see a start  
Take without doubt  
Won't you put your feet back on the ground?  
(Won't you put your feet back on the ground?)
