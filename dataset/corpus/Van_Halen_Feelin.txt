Outta touch most the time  
Gotta lotta things on my mind  
Kickin' down, where to start  
It's the hardest thing  
Oh...  
Grow it long, shave it off  
Life is hard, never soft  
I need a change, I need it quick  
Before it makes me sick  
That's what's on my mind  
Pay attention, watch your back  
Pay your dues, stay on track  
Got no room to second-guess  
Puts me under stress  
Oh...  
If I were you, you were me  
I wonder who I'd want to be  
With just one wish you can't refuse  
I wouldn't know what to choose  
Feelin'...no, don't like what I've been  
Told I'm feelin'  
Feelin' what no one else will ever  
Know I'm feelin'  
Oh...  
Now black is white and white is  
Black  
Got politicians smokin' crack  
And John Paul's all bullet-proofed  
It puts me through the roof  
Yea...  
I were you and you were me  
I wonder who I'd rather be  
If I had one wish I'd take it  
Feelin'...oh, I don't like what I've been  
Told I'm feelin'  
And I'm seein'  
What no one else will ever know I'm  
Seein'  
Come on, feelin'  
Hey, I don't understand these things  
I'm feelin'  
No...  
Outta touch most all the time  
Too many things on my mind  
Shuttin' down, gotta stop this thing  
Feelin'...no, I don't like what I've been  
Told I'm feelin'  
I'm bleeding...like no one else will  
Ever know I'm bleeding  
Dealin'...I'm dealin' with these things  
I'm feelin'  
I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin', I'm  
Dreamin' things that show me what  
I'm seein'  
Seein'...I'm seein' things that I don't  
Know I'm feelin'  
I've been feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin'  
Things that I don't know  
I don't know, I don't know what I'm  
Seein'  
Hey, I don't understand
