Once I was young yesterday  
Perhaps danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps  
Once I was young but never was naive  
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve  
And now I know I was naive  
  
I didn't know what time it was then I met you  
Oh, what a lovely time it was how sublime it was too  
I didn't know what day it was you held my hand  
Warm like the month of May it was and I'll say it was grand  
  
Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone  
Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice  
Say I'm all your own  
  
I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize  
I wanted love and here it was, shining out of your eyes  
I'm wise and I know what time it is now
