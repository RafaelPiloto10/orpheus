I've been thinking it over  
So many times they say  
You got it made  
They never understand  
The answer lies within your soul  
'Cause no one know which side  
The coin will fall.  
  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning, turning...  
  
Save it for a rainy day  
For when the cold wind blows  
Just to see how they run  
I thought they'd know  
I tried my best, all I could do  
But somehow it was not enough for you.  
  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning, turning,  
Turning, turning...  
  
I remember the dead of night  
A lonely light that shines upon the window  
I see it all so clear  
The tenderness, the silent tears  
Out here in the pouring rain  
Through cold dark waiting days  
I see you standing there  
I see the big wheels turning  
Never ending, on and on they go.  
  
I think I'm going home  
I think I'm gonna have to start again  
It's rather sad  
Because I've looked around, can't seem to find  
Whatever's always rolling through my mind  
  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning  
Baby I know  
Big wheels turning, turning  
Turning, turning...  
  
I remember the dead of night  
A lonely light that shines upon the window  
I see it all so clear  
The tenderness, the silent tears  
Out here in the pouring rain  
Through cold dark waiting days  
I see you standing there  
I see the big wheels turning  
Never ending, on and on they go.
