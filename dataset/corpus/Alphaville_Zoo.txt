Look at me, you can watch me  
Listen to me, you can hear me  
Talk to me, you can yell at me  
Play with me, you infuriate me  
  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see , but you better not touch me  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see me through, but you better not touch me  
  
Does it make you feel better? to know that I'm here to stay.  
Does it make you feel better? to know my heart is locked away.  
Does it make you feel safer? knowing I won't get away.  
Does it make you feel safer? to have my soul in chains.  
  
Watching you, I can look at you  
Hearing you, I can listen to you  
Yelling at you, I can't talk to you  
Feeling you, I wish I could touch you  
  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see , but you better not touch me  
Look at me, just watch me  
Try to see me through, but you better not touch me  
  
Does it make you feel better? to know .  
Does it make you feel better? to know that I'm here to stay.  
Does it make you feel .better?  
Does it make you feel safer? knowing I won't get away.  
  
Does it make you feel safer? to have my soul in chains.
