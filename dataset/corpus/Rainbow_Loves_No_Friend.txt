Well I don't need much  
But I need a friend  
Or did you got time for me  
Ain't no trouble with you're always down  
To find a friend in misery  
But that's allright  
That's allright  
Ain't gonna fall for the line  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Don't need no sun to shine  
When love's no friend of mine  
I've been so down I've been on my knees  
Just don't seem to feel no pain  
Natural loser I've been on the run  
Got no shelter from the rain  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Ain't gonna fall for the line  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Don't need no sun to shine  
No cause love's no friend of mine  
Learn to live wether climb above my head  
Got no shame, got no pride  
If you need affection  
Don't knock on my door  
Got no feelings left inside  
But that's allright  
Yes, That's allright  
Ain't gonna fall for the line  
That's allright  
That's allright  
Don't need no sun to shine  
Cause love's no friend  
Cause love's no friend  
Ah no friend of mine  
Love's no friend of mine
