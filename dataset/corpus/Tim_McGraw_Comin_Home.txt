Say goodbye to Old Man Winter  
Say hello to sweet springtime  
'Cause I'm coming out of hiding  
I'm gonna get it right this time  
  
After so long being frozen  
It took a while to thaw me out  
I spent too long not knowing  
What love's supposed to be about  
  
Now I'm finding out  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a lot like coming home  
From a long time walking out in the snow  
Then I looked at you and knew I never knew nothing  
And it broke this heart of stone  
It's a lot like coming home  
  
Like a bird out on the harbor  
That's been battered by the sea  
I've been through some stormy weather  
But you shine a light for me  
Girl, you set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
Girl, I looked at you and knew I never knew nothing  
And it broke this heart of stone  
It's a lot like coming home  
Coming home  
Feels like I'm coming home, coming home, coming home  
Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home  
  
Oh baby, I'm coming home, coming home, coming home  
Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home  
  
I'm coming home  
  
(Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home  
Coming home, coming home)  
  
(Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home  
Coming home, coming home)  
  
(Coming home, coming home, coming home, coming home  
Coming home, coming home)
