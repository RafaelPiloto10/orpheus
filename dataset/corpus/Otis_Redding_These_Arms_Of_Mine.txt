These arms of mine, they are lonely,  
Lonely and feeling blue.  
  
These arms of mine, they are yearning,  
Yearning from wanting you.  
  
And if you would let them hold you,  
Oh how grateful I will be.  
  
These arms of mine, they are burning,  
Burning from wanting you.  
  
These arms of mine, they are wanting,  
Wanting to hold you.  
  
And if you would let them hold you,  
Oh how grateful I will be.  
  
Come on, come on baby  
Just be my little woman.  
Just be my lover.  
  
I need me somebody, somebody to treat me right.  
I need your arms, loving arms to hold me tight.  
  
I need your, I need your tender lips, to hold me,  
To hold me together when I'm around you.
