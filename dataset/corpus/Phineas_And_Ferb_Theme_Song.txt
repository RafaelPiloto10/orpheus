There's 104 days of summer vacation  
And school comes along just to end it  
So the annual problem for our generation  
Is finding a good way to spend it  
  
Like maybe...  
Building a rocket  
Or fighting a mummy  
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower  
  
Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey!)  
Or giving a monkey a shower  
  
Surfing tidal waves  
Creating nanobots  
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)  
  
Finding a dodo bird  
Painting a continent  
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)  
  
As you can see  
There's a whole lot of stuff to do  
Before school starts this fall (Come on Perry)  
  
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb  
Are gonna do it all  
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are  
Gonna do it all!  
(Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!!)
