There's a miracle waiting, there's a ticket worth taking  
There's a reason to believe your eyes  
An ounce of conviction is the only admission  
Yeah, it's risky, but it's worth the ride  
And all the dreams that you've held inside  
Yes, they're waiting to break out, you just have to try  
  
Make it shine, let your heart beat right in time  
Make it shine, lay your whole world on the line  
  
Find a clue and unfold it, shake the dust off and hold it  
If it tells you something let me know  
So much is forgotten, so much worth unlocking  
Won't you tell me how to break the code  
And never worry 'bout the things you read  
It's so easy to tear down, so hard to believe  
  
Too may dreamers are fading, shine on, shine on, shine  
  
Live, there's a life to live  
Give, there's a gift to give  
Yes, there's a reason to make it  
Shine on and make it true,  
Work, make it work for you  
Yes, there's a reason to make it shine  
  
Find a secret and learn it, find a key there and turn it  
Do whatever you do through the night  
A skill in your fingers like a memory lingers  
You gotta do it till it comes out right  
You never know till you take a chance  
If you're out on that wire you might as well dance
