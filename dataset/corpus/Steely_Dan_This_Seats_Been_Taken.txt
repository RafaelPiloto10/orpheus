What is the meaning  
Of the morning rain?  
I got a feeling  
It's no good  
I waited for my baby  
But she never made the train  
Now I'm hoping  
At the next stop she will be there  
She'll catch my eye  
And satisfy my every care  
This seat's been taken  
Don't ask me where she's coming from  
You're quite mistaken  
You know she's gonna be here  
I know she's gonna come  
She must have a reason  
I will understand  
I know she'll turn up  
By and by  
I'll see her standing  
With a suitcase in her hand  
And she'll tell me  
How she couldn't find a pay 'phone  
She'll start to cry  
I'll realize I'm not alone
