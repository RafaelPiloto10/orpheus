Was it something I did  
Was it something I said  
Was the vision you had  
Just a voice in your head  
Can you run through the flames  
Can you see through the haze  
Is this the end of your world  
Or just one of your days  
  
I've yet to taste it on my tongue  
I get so dangerous on my own  
  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
  
Would you call it untrue  
Would you call it a sin  
With the burden of proof  
Breathing under my skin  
Like a ghost from the past  
I'm the face in the crowd  
And the name that you scream  
When you're dreaming out loud  
  
I've yet to taste it on my tongue  
I get so dangerous on my own  
  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
  
I've yet to taste it on my tongue  
I get so dangerous on my own  
  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake
