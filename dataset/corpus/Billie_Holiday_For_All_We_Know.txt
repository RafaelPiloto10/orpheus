Sweetheart, the night is growing old  
Sweetheart, my love is still untold  
A kiss that is never tasted  
Forever and ever is wasted  
  
For all we know, we may never meet again  
Before you go, make this moment sweet again  
We won't say, goodnight until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know this may only be a dream  
We come and go like a ripple on a stream  
So love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come, for all we know
