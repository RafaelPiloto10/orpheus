Head over heels is fine  
Unless you're in stilettos  
Love knows no boundaries  
Unless your in one of love's ghettos  
  
Love climb every mountain high  
But some of us are stuck in a cell  
All you need is love, love, love  
And a bloody good tunnel as well  
  
You could get here by aeroplane or boat  
Not unreasonable demands  
But I could save myself the price of a ticket  
If I didn't let go of your hands  
  
Never mind killing me getting there  
But somebody has to make plans  
First embrace shoots you into space  
And doesn't give a damn where it lands  
  
Why not take a chance on love?  
Even at hundred to one  
If we promise that we'll never let love die  
Within a week one of us'll be gone  
  
Love sure makes the world go round  
And takes you for a hell of a ride  
But I don't wanna waste time searching for love  
When it's already stood at my side  
  
Love will make you blind to the truth  
Romantic novels all tell  
So I'll spend a little time romancing by myself  
But that turned me blind as well  
  
You can get here by crossing sea or desert  
I can barely make Blackpool Sands  
Railroad, caravan, save it for the mad man  
Lets see if love just stands  
  
Never mind killing me getting there  
But somebody has to make plans  
First embrace shoots you into space  
And doesn't give a damn where it lands  
  
Why not take a chance on love?  
Even at a hundred to one  
If we promise that we'll never let love die  
Then within a week one of us'll be gone  
  
Does the length of journey your heart makes  
Really provide any proof?  
All it really proves is love never moves  
When it's right there under your roof  
  
My heart is in the right place  
Then what's the point in making that trip  
Stay right here with your hand on my heart  
See how often you cause it to skip  
  
See how often you cause it to skip  
See how often you cause it to skip
