There's a place where lovers go to cry their troubles away  
And they call it lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay  
You can buy a dream or two to last you all through the years  
And the only price you pay is a heartful of tears  
  
Goin' down to lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay  
Goin' down to lonesome town to cry my troubles away  
In the town of broken hearts the streets are paved with regret  
Maybe down in lonesome town I can learn to forget
