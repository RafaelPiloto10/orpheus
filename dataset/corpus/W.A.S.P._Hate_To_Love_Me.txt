You know I deceived ya  
You see it's all in my eyes  
A marquee of madness  
DeSade I claim that you're mine  
The mad eyes of your lover  
In through my eyes you see  
No you'll never run  
  
I know your emotions  
Are slaves I've bound and I've tied  
You'll never be free  
Cause you Master's chained to your life  
The mad eyes of your lover  
In through your soul I see  
No you'll never run  
  
I got no face  
But I've a name  
I'll touch, and add you to my fame  
I'll set you free but understand  
Mom and daddy made me what I am  
The mad eyes of your lover  
In through your soul I see  
No you'll never run  
  
I know you hate to  
Love me, love me  
No matter what you do  
I know you hate to love me, love me  
Oh no you got nothing to lose no, no
