I am sitting in the Dark, I'm with my Love  
We are looking into each other's eyes  
I know if THEY take her away, there is no life  
Take her away and I die  
  
"Tell me this is not goodbye"  
Do you remember the Butterfly  
"It made me cry"  
I know but we dried it's wings so it could fly again  
  
I wonder if this is the end, for You and I  
I know we've got to say goodbye  
I know that I would change my life for You  
I would die for you  
  
"I will always remember the things we used to do  
All the memories I keep in here, just for me and You  
With your image in my eyes  
I take You with me when it's time to go"  
  
I swear I swear I'll find You  
I'll keep on searching, searching 'til the end of time  
"And if I can't survive without You by my side"  
Then wait for me, wait for me  
Wait on the other side I'll be there  
  
"I can barely see You anymore"  
You must remember the Butterfly, it did not die  
"I Love You" I Love you Too  
"I can't see You anymore"  
  
Goodbye my love
