I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
How I remember the first time we went to movie  
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
And I feel so good  
And I feel so right  
And I know that you must have a lovelight  
  
You've got lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere  
Maybe even when you're not there  
You've got lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
Everything about you is right  
Let it glow and let it be bright  
I don't want to lose your lovelight  
Shining like a star in the night
