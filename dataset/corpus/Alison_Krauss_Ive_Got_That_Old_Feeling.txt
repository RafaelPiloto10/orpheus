No matter what I say or do,  
I just can't seem to get inside your heart  
What have I done wrong?  
Lately you're so far away,  
You just don't seem to hold me like you used to  
Something's going on  
I've got that old feeling, you're leaving  
I'm so tired of goodbye  
I can't wait on your love forever  
While you change your mind  
Morning finds us face to face  
I feel you staring through me while I'm talking  
Familiar looks I recognize the same old looks that said goodbye the last time  
Something I'm used to  
I've got that old feeling, you're leaving  
I'm so tired of goodbye  
I can't wait on your love forever  
While you change your mind
