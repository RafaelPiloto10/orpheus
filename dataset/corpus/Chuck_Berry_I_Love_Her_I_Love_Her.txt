I love her, I love her  
I love her, I'm in love with her  
There's no other problem  
As big as the one living without her  
Ah! Mama, we'll make it  
With her I can take it, I love her  
  
I'm so happy when I'm about her  
And so lonely without her  
I love her, I love her  
I love her, oh, I love her  
  
His mother tried to tell him  
That kinda wedlock could bring strife  
So many are against it  
I offer you peace and joy and life  
Why risk all the problems  
That may come with her being your wife  
Ah! He looked up with tears in his eyes  
Saying, "Mother, don't you realize  
I love her, I love her  
I love her, I love her, I love her"  
  
Father advised her  
That so many wouldn't understand  
They'd more or less resent you  
If they even saw you holding his hand  
Why choose the problems that may face you now  
In this man?  
  
She looked up with tears in her eyes  
Said, "Father, do you realize  
That I love him, I love him  
I love him, I love him, I love him"  
That's why I love her  
I love her, I love her, I love her  
  
There's no other problem  
As big as the one living without her  
Mama, we'll make it  
With her I can take it, I love her  
I'm so happy when I'm about her  
I love her, I love her  
I love her, I love her, I love her
