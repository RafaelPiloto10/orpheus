I watch the world go by in silence  
Deep in the night in silence  
Time going by so slow  
I think about the morning  
And it warns my heart  
Because tonight I'm going back to the one I love  
And by tomorrow with the dawn I'll be there  
And he'll be beside me  
  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Bring me the love I'll need to guide me  
Shining deep inside of me  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Show me the way  
  
I look at the stars and I pray for morning  
Counting the hours till morning  
Thinking about his smile  
His sweet smile  
I'm standing on the promise of a brand new day  
I couldn't face another night staying all alone  
I know he needs me just as much as I need him  
So, baby, I'm coming home  
  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Bring me the love I'll need to guide me  
Shining deep inside of me  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Show me the way  
Ooh ohhhhh, yeah  
  
And when I hold him  
I won't let him let me go, no no no  
No more running far and wide  
I'm gonna stay right by his side  
He's my laughter, my lover, my life  
He's my sunlight  
  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Show me the way to a brighter day  
  
Oh, sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Bring me the love I'll need to guide me  
Shining deep inside of me  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Show me the way to a brighter day  
  
Oh, sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Bring me the love I'll need to guide me  
Shining deep inside of me  
Sunlight, oh, sunlight  
Show me the way...  
To a brighter day  
Ooohhhhh
