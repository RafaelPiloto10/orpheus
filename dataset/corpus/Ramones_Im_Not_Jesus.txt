Don't wear a crown of thorns  
Got no holes in my hand  
Don't accuse me of that crime  
Don't hang me up to dry  
  
It's not me It's not me It's not me  
  
Don't wanna die for your sins  
Got no special powers  
Sacrifice and sacrilege  
Hey man, I wanna live  
  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
  
Taste my blood  
it doesn't taste like wine  
Can't you see this cross isn't mine  
Judas must die for what he has done  
Satan's watching with his gun  
  
It's not me  
It's not me  
It's not me  
  
Father, son and Holy Ghost  
Say your prayers-it's your only hope  
Twelve apostles can't help you now  
I'll be back to stake my ground  
  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
  
Don't wear a crown of thorns  
Got no holes in my head  
Don't accuse me of that crime  
Don't hang me up to dry  
  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you  
I'm not Jesus  
I can't heal you
