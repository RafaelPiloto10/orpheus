I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
Tables of paper wood  
Windows of light  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A simple garden, with acres of sky  
A brown-haired dogmouse  
If one should drop by  
Yellow delanie would sleep well at night  
And everything emptying into white  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  
A black spider dancing on top of his eye  
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike  
And everything emptying into white
