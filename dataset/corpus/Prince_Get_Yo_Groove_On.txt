Get your groove on  
I got some money 'cause I just got paid  
It's time to get my groove on  
Been workin' hard, now it's time to play  
I gots to get my groove on  
Can't wait to see your face again  
You keep me happy, yeah, you're my best friend  
In the park around a half past 9  
Meet me, we'll have a real good time  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on, everybody get your groove on  
Come on, we gonna party all night long  
Get your groove on  
  
I got some honey and some peppermint tea  
That's all I need to get my drink on  
Don't want this night to end if you're with me  
We gonna party all night long  
Bring the player, I'll bring the CDs  
But don't you put nothing slow on  
That new D'Angelo, some N.P.G.  
And we'll make a bet to see who keep their clothes on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm usually workin' both night and day  
No time for fun  
But tonight I'm gonna get my groove on  
I'm sayin' 'til I see the sun  
Till I see the sun, ooh, I wanna play  
  
Come on  
  
Speak  
Hey girl, let's hang tonight  
Alrighty  
Around a half past 9  
  
I got some money 'cause I just got paid  
It's time to get my groove on  
Been workin' hard, now it's time to play  
I gots to get my groove on  
  
Come on, everybody get your groove on (Hey baby)  
Come on  
Get your groove on  
  
Get your groove on  
  
Hey, nice joint, huh  
It's alright  
You see anything you like in here, you know what I'm sayin'  
I think I see little somethin', somethin' over there  
But there's to much smoke in here, eh  
Wait, wait, wait  
What's your name, lil'  
Come here  
  
Get it on, get on  
Get your groove on  
Baby, get your groove on  
Oh yeah  
Get it on

Getcha, getcha, get your groove on  
Getcha, getcha  
Getcha, getcha, get your groove on  
Getcha, get your groove on  
Oh baby  
Get your groove on  
Oh baby, oh yeah  
Get your groove on  
Get your groove on  
  
Girl, you believe that brother that came over here  
I'm tellin' you, with a tooth missin' and everything  
Hey Rhonda, girl, how you doin'  
Hey, how you doin' Montalbo  
Is Juice in there  
Don't you mean,  
You know, Big Julius  
The sleazy one  
Yo, I know Big Juice is in there, girl  
  
Gettin' that groove on (Get your groove on)  
(Getcha, getcha, get your groove on)  
Oh, get it on  
  
Girl, I think we better leave  
Cause if we don't, I think I might have to have another one  
Then I might change my name to,  
What's my name  
Margarita  
  
Y'all help me find Juice, I'm tryin', I can't find him  
Are you still lookin' for him  
Yeah, he's just, you know  
He's up in here somewhere, I can't find him though  
(No no, definitely not seen him)  
Girl, let's go, I smell like an ashtray  
(It's time to go)  
We ain't goin' nowhere  
  
Sir, I'm sorry  
This club has a very strict dress code  
We do not accept bluejeans  
  
What you mean  
It don't take Stevie Wonder to see I got on the right clothes in here  
I need to get up in this club  
Hell, I could buy every one of ya  
Fuck yourself
