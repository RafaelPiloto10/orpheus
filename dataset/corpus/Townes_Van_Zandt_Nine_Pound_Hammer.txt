This nine pound hammer,  
Is a little too heavy,  
For my side, baby for my side.  
  
I'm a-goin' to the mountain,  
Gonna see my baby.  
But I ain't comin' back,  
No. I ain't comin' back.  
  
Roll on, buddy,  
Don't ya roll so slow.  
How, can I roll,  
When my wheels won't go.  
  
Well. it's a long way to Harlan,  
It's a long way to hazard,  
Just to get a little brew,  
Just to get a little brew.  
  
When I'm long gone,  
Don't you make my tombstone,  
Outta number nine coal,  
Outta number nine coal.
