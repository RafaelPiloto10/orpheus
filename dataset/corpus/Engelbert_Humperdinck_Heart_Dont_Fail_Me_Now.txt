Wish she could see the part of me  
That hides behind the love that used to be  
It got lost somehow, heart don't fail me now  
  
Took so long for you to mend  
And now I am face to face with love again  
Need you to show me how, heart don't fail me now  
  
No one ever told me there'd be someone like her  
To make it all seem worth another try  
This time love found me too afraid to take a chance  
But too afraid to let it pass me by  
  
I can't forget the hurt before, I'd be a fool for coming back for more  
Except this time I feel so sure  
We'll make it work somehow, heart don't fail me now
