Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel  
And the storm is brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
And that's why I'm lonely all the time  
  
So take back the treasured dreams I have for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach
