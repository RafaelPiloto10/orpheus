I fell in love with you  
The moment that we met  
And till the end of time  
I never will forget  
I lose it every time I'm close to you  
Under your spell you know there's nothing I can do  
  
[Chorus]  
Please stay my babe  
Who knows when we'll dance again  
No matter what to no regret  
I'll do all that I can just to get you  
To stay my babe  
Who knows when we'll dance again  
And I don't want to say goodbye  
But who knows where we'll be after tonight  
  
There's nothing stopping us  
You don't have to go  
The night is young for us  
There's more we need to know  
I lose it every time I'm close to you  
Under your spell you know there's nothing I can do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I lose it every time I'm close to you  
Under your spell you know there's nothing I can do  
  
[Chorus]
