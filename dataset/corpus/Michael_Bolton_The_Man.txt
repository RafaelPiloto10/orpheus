[Verse:]  
I paid my dudes  
I made some money, living the dream and it's life that I made  
I lost some friends, yeah life's been funny  
But I don't regret any car that I paid  
I thought I had it all  
(I was wrong)  
I thought I had everything I needed  
But I wasn't true cuz I didn't have you  
And now I have someone to believe in  
And strong enough to offer something new  
To the man that has everything  
(The man that has everything)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I face this world and move some mountains  
Gather my strengh from the lessons I've learned  
I lost my faith  
I think god you found it and all that you asked is my love in return  
  
I thought I had it all  
(I was wrong)  
I thought I had everything I needed  
But I wasn't true cuz I didn't have you  
And now I have someone to believe in  
And strong enough to offer something new  
To the man that has everything  
(The man that has everything)  
  
I thought I had everything I needed  
But I wasn't true cuz I didn't have you  
And now I have someone to believe in  
And strong enough to offer something new  
To the man that has everything  
(The man that has everything)
