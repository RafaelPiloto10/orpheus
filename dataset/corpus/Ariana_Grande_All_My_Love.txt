[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]  
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars  
And I try to believe we'll find a way  
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?  
(Major Lazer)  
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside  
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?  
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?  
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Only love will make us ache  
Only love is worth the chase  
All my love, I know we're waiting for this  
On the rocks upon the mountain tops  
  
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
All my love  
All my love  
All my love  
Up on the mountain top  
  
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]  
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say  
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game  
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain  
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Only love will make us ache  
Only love is worth the chase  
All my love, I know we're waiting for this  
On the rocks upon the mountain tops  
  
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
All my love  
All my love  
All my love  
Up on the mountain top  
  
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]  
You're always on my mind, oh, there'll come a day  
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze, oh, hey  
High up in the sun in the brightest sky  
Sun in the brightest sky  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Only love will make us ache  
Only love is worth the chase  
All my love, I know we're waiting for this  
On the rocks upon the mountain tops  
  
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
All my love  
All my love  
All my love  
Up on the mountain top
