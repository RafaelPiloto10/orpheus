Twilight time to dream awhile,  
In veils of deepening blue.  
As fantasy strides, over colourfull skies,  
Of form disappearing from view.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
A nightingale plays a dark mellow phrase,  
Of notes that are rich and so true.  
An aerial display by the firefly brigade,  
Dancing to tunes no one knew.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
Building castles in the air,  
Whistling to the wind.  
As nature bows down her head,  
See what tomorrow brings.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
Bats take to wing like puppets on string,  
Prancing through cool evening air.  
In a sightless glide, no reason to hide  
Away from the sun's blinding stare.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.
