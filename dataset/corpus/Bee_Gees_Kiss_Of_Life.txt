Never more aware of what you do.  
I got you leaving me and missing you  
And me believing that you've never done right  
When you've never done wrong.  
  
You been coming to me late at night.  
It's not the eye alone that gives you sight.  
I've never given anybody my soul,  
But I'm coming undone.  
  
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low,  
But I'm not ready to die.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
Just give me the kiss of life.  
  
Watch them hold you.  
Count their faces,  
A never-ending line.  
  
But they're only  
Imitations,  
Existing out of time.  
  
So now you're telling me it's just a ring.  
You say it's nothing but it's everything.  
I'm under pressure and I'm under  
Your gun and I'm fingers and thumbs.  
  
You got the questions and the answers I know.  
I'm being buried alive.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
Just give me the kiss of life.  
  
I can't stay here  
Lost without you.  
Strangers in the dark.  
  
Holy angel,  
Living for you  
To love and never cry.  
  
I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low,  
But I'm not ready to die.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
Just give me the kiss of life, oh.  
  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh.  
I'm here for the kiss of life, oh
