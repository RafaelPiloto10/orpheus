I could tell you a story from another day in time  
How a high falootin' woman tried to make me walk the line  
She was into changin' too damn hard to please  
And the last time I saw her she was down on her knees.  
  
Born under the sign of the Gemini twins  
There's two sides to me and they ain't even friends  
All sides are rising and there ain't no in between  
When I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen.  
  
Sometimes I'm out a prowlin' and carryin' on  
Too high to know when it's time to take it home  
When I'm like that it's hard to leave the women alone  
It ain't easy thinkin' right with a good looking wrong.  
  
For another sign of the Gemini twins  
This two sides to me and me ain't even friends  
All sides are rising in the rainbow in between  
When I'm good I'm good when I'm bad I'm the worst you ever seen.  
  
There's a good hearted woman waitin' when I come in  
She don't wasting time and asking me about where I've been  
She keeps it all together and to wish that you could see  
Know she goes about bring it out the best side of me.  
  
Born under the sign of the Gemini twins  
There's two sides to me and they ain't even friends  
All signs are rising, and there ain't no in between  
When I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen
