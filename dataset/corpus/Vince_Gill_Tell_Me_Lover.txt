Tell me lover, tell me what you're gonna do  
You gonna walk the walk or just talk the talk  
Honey, what's up with you  
  
Tell me lover, tell me how it's gonna be  
You gonna mess around or just turn me down  
Honey, won't you please tell me  
  
Your good intentions ain't too good no more  
You answer questions by slammin' that bedroom door  
Come on baby let's turn the lamp down low  
I'll solve your problems so honey please don't go  
  
If the silence could kiill, honey we'd both be dead  
It ain't hard to tell we're hangin' on by a thread  
Say somethin' darlin' say what's on your mind  
We'll find the answer, I got nothin' but time
