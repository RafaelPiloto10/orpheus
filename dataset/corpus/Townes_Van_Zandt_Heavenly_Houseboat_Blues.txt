I'm building a houseboat in heaven  
To sail those deep and holy seas  
I'm building a houseboat in heaven  
And it's welcome aboard you sweet peace  
  
The bow she is made of solid silver  
And the hall she is made of solid gold  
She ain't much long the line's a-floating  
But she's yours, babe, to have and to hold  
  
I rode my old guitar to heaven  
But heaven didn't feel too much like home  
So I'm headed out on to them lonesome oceans  
In my rubystudded houseboat to roam
