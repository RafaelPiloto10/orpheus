Woken up on mornings such as this  
Thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now  
Every night for a year I've slept alone  
Cold, damp room looks worse than me, no, no, no  
  
Got a fear of death that creeps on every night  
I know I won't die soon, but then again I might  
Water down the drain, I'm wasting away  
Doctors can't help the ghost of a man that's me, no, no, no  
  
Water down the drain goes to the sea  
The pattern of my life keeps a-haunting me  
Moisture from the ocean fills the sky  
Come on down to the ground as the time goes by  
  
Slow down there  
  
I never found out the reason why  
My parents had to lie  
About the place that I was born  
Or from my hometown I was torn  
At the tender age of four  
I was livin' by homemade law  
  
I never knew when it was to be laid,  
My desires are never displayed,  
I never knew what it was to be loved,  
I never knew what it was to be laid,  
I never knew what it was to win,  
I never knew what it was to be loved,  
No, no, no  
  
Get on up there  
  
I never knew what it was to be laid  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
