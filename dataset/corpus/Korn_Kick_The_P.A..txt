You simply defy, I cannot even look to the sky,  
we try it single filed, take on me, and it's my denial,  
I cannot ever find, something safe, not done on the fly,  
I cannot live this way, floor and me will kick the P.A  
  
You want to play with me  
I'm really gonna rock your world  
You want to comfort me  
I'm gonna rock your world  
  
You say everything is fine, I cannot compete with the skies,  
my sing has crossed the line, come in me,  
I fly through the sky, I can not ever find,  
you and me will make all the lines, oh, if they could see the plague,  
no one would want to be me  
  
You want to play with me  
I'm really gonna rock your world  
You want to comfort me  
I'm gonna rock your world  
  
So I fly  
Take me  
I cannot fly  
Most people hate me  
To fly away from this pain  
Please take away  
Please take away my P.A
