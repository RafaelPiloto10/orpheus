This is family business  
And this is for the family that can't be with us  
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us  
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet  
Like a photo of your granny's picture  
Now that you're gone it hit us  
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right  
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life  
Somebody please say grace so I can save face  
And have a reason to cover my face  
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it  
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it  
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?  
As kids we used to laugh  
Who knew that life would move this fast?  
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?  
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it  
And if you did, then that's family business  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
This is family business  
And this is for everybody standin' with us  
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture  
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?  
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"  
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it  
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite  
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider  
But when we get together be electric slidin'  
Grandma, get 'em shook up  
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up  
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name  
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane  
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude  
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food  
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins  
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins  
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins  
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all  
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg  
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed  
  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
Rain, rain, rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
  
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind  
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns  
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God  
And keep your face to the risin' sun  
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog  
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog  
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog  
You can still love your man and be manly dog  
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'  
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman  
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?  
The second she storms out then he storms in  
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion  
And drink some wine like Communion  
And act like everything fine and if it isn't  
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business  
  
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
They don't mean a thing  
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing, a thing  
  
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)  
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
All these things
