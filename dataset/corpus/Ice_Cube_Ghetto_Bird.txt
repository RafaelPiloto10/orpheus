Why oh why must you swoop through the hood  
like everybody from the hood is up to no good.  
You think all the girls around here are trickin'  
up there lookin' like Super chicken  
At night I see your light through my bedroom window  
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil  
I can't wait till I hear you say  
"I'm going down mayday mayday." I'm gonna clown  
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me  
y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi  
military force, but we don't want ya  
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher  
"So fly like an eagle."  
But don't follow us wherever we go  
The shit that I'm saying, make it's heard  
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird  
  
"Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird"  
"Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird"  
  
Now  
My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex  
And let me try the four next  
Now the four I was driving was hotter than july  
looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky  
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom  
"Calling all cars, I think we've got em."  
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood  
I think I drove through every single hood  
South Central, Compton and Watts  
Long Beach, bust a you, here come the cops  
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes  
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious  
You know that I'm running  
Shit, I hear it humming  
Fuck, I see it coming  
Is it a bird? Yup  
Is it a plane? No  
I hit me a right on El Segundo  
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala  
Let's see if they would folla  
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another  
met me a baby pitbull and his mother  
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window  
I wish it was my ten-four  
had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third  
'cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird  
  
"Just put his hat, ehrrr,  
he combed his hair and then put his hat back on.  
he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115  
miles an hour, with the police chasing him.  
they're not gonna be  
real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh  
They hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse."  
  
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't want to see him  
could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?  
See, I didn't want to gank you  
but don't make me bank you, thank you  
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess  
that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus  
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle  
Saying, "Fuck, where did he go?"  
I bust me a left from Rubellon. Park  
The 735 and I'm bailin'  
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man,  
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman  
Looked out the window by the black bed  
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed  
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face  
I close the blinds cause I didn't want to catch a case  
All that night, I heard the bird circle  
while I was eating fish and watching Urkel  
She said I could sleep on the couch  
By two A.M. I was digging her out  
Fuck the ghetto bird  
  
"Which way is he going now?"  
"Ok, now, now he's, he's actually southbound, on a service street  
and, uh, Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure  
out which service street he suddenly turned off on. Uh, the sheriffs  
are, are, well I know that, Sheriffs ground units got thrown off"  
  
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird
