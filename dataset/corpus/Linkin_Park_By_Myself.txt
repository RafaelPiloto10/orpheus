What do I do to ignore them behind me?  
Do I follow my instincts blindly?  
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams  
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?  
Do I sit here and try to stand it?  
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?  
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,  
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?  
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin  
I make the right moves but I'm lost within  
I put on my daily facade but then  
I just end up getting hurt again  
By myself (myself)  
  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't hold on.  
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.  
It's all too much to take in.  
I can't hold on.  
To end things watching everything spin.  
With thoughts of failure sinking in.  
  
If I turn my back I'm defenseless  
And to go blindly seems senseless  
If I hide my pride and let it all go on  
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone  
If I let them go I'll be outdone  
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun  
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer  
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer  
By myself (myself)  
  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How do you think  
I've lost so much  
I'm so afraid  
I'm out of touch  
How do you expect  
I will know what to do  
When all I know  
Is what you tell me to  
  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't hold on  
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)  
It's all too much to take in  
I can't hold on  
(To anything watching everything spin)  
Without some failure sinking
