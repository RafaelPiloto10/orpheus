[Verse 1]  
This is a black, black ski mask song,  
So put all of your anger on.  
In the truly gruesome do we trust,  
I will always land on you like a sucker punch.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you,  
You, would never sing along.  
Cast them out because this is our culture,  
These new flocks are nothing but vultures.  
  
[Chorus]  
Because they took our love and they filled it up,  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,  
Now I'm just numb!  
Don't' mind me, I'm just a son of a gun,  
Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,  
Now I'm just stuck!  
I don't feel a thing for you!  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm just a problem that doesn't want to be solved,  
So could you please hold your applause?  
Take this sideshow and all its freaks,  
And turn it into the silver screen-dream.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you,  
You, would never sing along.  
Cast them out because this is our culture,  
These new flocks are nothing but vultures.  
  
[Chorus]  
Because they took our love and they filled it up,  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,  
Now I'm just numb!  
Don't' mind me, I'm just a son of a gun,  
Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,  
Now I'm just stuck!  
I don't feel a thing for you!  
  
[Bridge]  
Ooooh, I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole.  
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)  
I sing like a photo that's been over exposed.  
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)  
  
[Outro]  
Because they took our love and they filled it up,  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,  
Now I'm just numb!  
Don't' mind me, I'm just a son of a gun,  
Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,  
Now I'm just stuck!  
I don't feel a thing for you!
