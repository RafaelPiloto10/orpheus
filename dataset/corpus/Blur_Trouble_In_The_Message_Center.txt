I am the message centre  
Local and direct  
Room to room  
An operator  
(No calls today, dear  
They'll just have to wait, dear)  
I call  
And I collect  
(So just strike him softly  
Away from the body)  
You're made up too shiny today  
There's so much trouble  
Your thoughts are just  
Pissing away  
It's so much trouble  
I am a manager  
And I am in control  
As the local delegator  
(No calls today, dear  
They'll just have to wait, dear)  
I offer no guarantee at all  
(So don't take it lightly  
You passed your sell-by date)  
You're made up too shiny today  
It's so much trouble  
Your thoughts are just  
Pissing away  
It's so much trouble  
A new typeface  
A new day  
It's so much trouble  
You can't remember ten minutes ago  
It's so much trouble  
Too much trouble
