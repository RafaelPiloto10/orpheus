We hold the secret to a dream  
We keep it wrapped in chains  
Locked inside a mystery.  
  
We climb a stairway to the stars  
Through doorways of the heart  
Step inside, the magic starts.  
  
Chorus:  
Gaze into my crystal ball,  
See what lies behind the wall  
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.  
  
You veil your eyes in fantasy  
Time to pull the curtain back  
Distant worlds, so much to see.  
  
Repeat Chorus.  
  
I want to know you, come on let me show you the way  
I really want to hold you, reach out to these hands of fate  
This is the moment we've been waiting for.
