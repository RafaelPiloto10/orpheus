I was cross-wired underground  
Nothing seemed to fit  
I was fried and memory bound  
Then it came to me  
  
Devil digger  
Unforgiver  
  
I was on a different plane  
He said come to me  
Laid his hands upon my brow  
That's the last of me  
  
Devil digger  
Unbeliever  
  
Don't be sorry  
It's no disgrace  
But never worry (unless)  
You have no faith  
  
See him coming  
He has no face  
You must stop running  
You must have faith  
  
Death's not final so were told  
Words are so profound  
Who the hell wants to get old  
But ask in the final hours  
  
Devil digger unbeliever  
Devil digger unforgiver  
  
See him coming  
He has no face  
You must stop running  
You must have faith  
  
I don't want to fade away  
I don't want to fade away  
I don't want to fade away  
I don't want to fade away
