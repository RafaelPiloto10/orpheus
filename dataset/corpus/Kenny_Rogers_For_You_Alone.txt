For you alone, I'd conquer world  
I'd do most anything for you alone  
For you alone, I'd give everything  
I'd say the sweetest thing for you alone.  
  
The things I can do I've been thinking of  
That I should have done alone  
Yet all these things I've been thinking of  
Are no good to do alone.  
  
For you alone, Ooh I'd write a song  
Using these words alone for you alone.  
The things ....
