O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
How steadfast are  
Your branches!  
Your boughs are green  
In summer's clime  
And through the snows  
Of wintertime.  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
How steadfast are  
Your branches!  
  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
What happiness befalls me  
When oft at  
Joyous Christmas-time  
Your form inspires  
My song and rhyme.  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
What happiness befalls me  
  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
Your boughs can  
Teach a lesson  
That constant faith  
And hope sublime  
Lend strength and  
Comfort through all time.  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
Your boughs can  
Teach a lesson
