Blue Savannah  
Blue Savannah song  
Oh blue Savannah song  
Somewhere 'cross the desert  
Sometime in the early hours  
In a restless world  
On the open highway  
  
My home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Blue Savannah song  
Oh blue Savannah song  
Racing 'cross the desert  
At a hundred miles an hour  
To the orange side  
Through the clouds and thunder  
  
My home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
I'm on my way back  
And your love will bring me home  
I'm traveling fast  
And your love will bring me home  
Will I discover  
That your love will bring me home?  
Will I discover  
That your love will bring me home?  
  
Somewhere 'cross the desert  
Sometime in the early hour  
To the orange side  
Through the clouds and thunder  
  
My home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Oh Savannah song  
To you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Oh Savannah song  
To you only  
To you only
