You win, I lose  
That's how it all begins  
Well I try so hard in these affairs of the heart  
But I know that I'll never win  
  
Well I talk to you sweet like honey  
Don't I treat you as nice as pie  
But I can't figure out when you scream and you shout  
Why I have to apologize  
  
You win, I lose  
That's how it always goes  
I came into this thing with my heart in a spin  
I went out with a broken nose  
  
You win, I lose  
That's how it's meant to be  
Well I tried all I can just to figure it out  
But love's just mystery  
  
Guess all you ladies would call me easy  
But I'm a fool for the femme fatale  
When she flashes those eyes I'm not a man I'm a mouse  
Tryin' to patch up a broken heart  
  
You win, I lose  
That's okay that's the way it goes  
Well I tried all I could but it did me no good  
'Cause all I've got is nothin' to show  
  
They say that men are always supposed to act  
Like they're not really tryin'  
But when I come on cool nobody seems to notice  
It's a mystery  
It's a mystery to me  
  
You see you win, I lose  
I guess that's how we're meant to be  
I tried as hard as I could but it did me no good  
You're more than a match for me  
And it don't make no sense to me  
Love is still a mystery  
It's just a mystery
