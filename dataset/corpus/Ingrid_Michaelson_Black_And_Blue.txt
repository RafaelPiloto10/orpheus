Oh I think I got you figured out  
Boy I think I know what you are all about  
Finally I can finally see  
You pull the darkness right down over me  
But now I see  
  
Everybody knows that I'm a mess  
Everybody knows you stole the heart from out my chest  
Everything you ever said was a lie  
You're hiding behind your sweet your sweet goodbyes  
  
I'm black and blue  
'cause I fell for you  
You said you never would let me go  
Oh how could I ever know  
  
I'm black and blue  
And in love with you  
You said, you never would let me fall  
You never would let me fall, but I'm falling  
You never would let me fall, you never would let me fall, but I'm falling  
  
Oh I know I'm never gonna stop  
I keep burning time away until I hit the top  
One day I'll wake up and take up to the open skies  
And I'll be the one with all  
I'm falling  
Black and blue  
It's what I need to do
