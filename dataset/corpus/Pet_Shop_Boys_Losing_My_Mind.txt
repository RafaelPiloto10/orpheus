The sun comes up, I think about you  
The coffee cup, I think about you  
I want you so, it's like I'm losing my mind  
  
The morning ends, I think about you  
I talk to friends and think about you  
And do they know it's like I'm losing my mind  
  
All afternoon doing every little chore  
The thought of you stays bright  
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor  
Not going left, not going right  
  
I dim the lights and think about you  
Spend sleepless nights to think about you  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
  
All afternoon doing every little chore  
The thought of you stays bright  
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor  
Not going left, not going right  
  
I dim the lights and think about you  
Spend sleepless nights to think about you  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
  
Or am I losing  
Losing my mind  
  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
  
Were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind  
Losing my mind  
Losing my mind
