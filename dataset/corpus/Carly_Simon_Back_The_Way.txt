Back the way it was before  
Before the door was opened  
Back the way it was before  
Before the ice was broken  
Back the way it used to be  
Everyone thought I was funny  
But nobody ever asked me  
If I wanted tiny little sandwiches  
Sent up to my room  
Back the way it was before  
I was always waiting  
Everyone thought I was okay  
But now I'm scintillating  
Back the way it used to be  
Some people thought I was pretty  
But not many passes were made at me  
Back the way it was before  
But now my prayers are answered  
And my star is on the rise  
Flashbulbs popping, traffic stopping  
Everyone's my best friend  
Back the way it used to be  
Money was always a tyrant  
I spent it all paying my rent  
Back the way it used to be  
But now my prayers are answered  
And my star is on the rise  
Flashbulbs popping, traffic stopping  
Everyone's my best friend  
Back the way it used to be  
Sing a song of long ago  
Back the way it used to be
