Sally goes 'round the roses  
Every night  
Trying to find a warm place  
To spend the night  
She becomes a target  
Soon as she rise  
Somebody wants to cut her  
Down to his size  
  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
The feeling's in my bones  
It won't leave me alone  
  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head  
  
Jimmy goes round the dumpsters every day  
Trying to find a way to  
Some kind of way  
He knows he's a target  
Everyone is  
Strangle that rock and roll star  
Make him eat jizz  
  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
The feeling's in my bones  
It won't leave me alone  
  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head
