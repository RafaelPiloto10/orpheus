Mother  
You're holding my heart, screaming  
Motherfucker  
That left me broken, bleeding  
Son of  
The man you loved and left for  
The son of a bitch  
Who tried to show me death's door  
  
Oh  
  
Everything's eliminated  
Everything is dedicated  
To the meaningless stuff i've hated  
Everything was overrated  
  
Love song for the dear departed  
Head stone for the broken hearted  
I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal  
Head trip for the mortal earth bound  
One sip of the blood that i've found  
Lying here  
I'm dying here  
  
Ascend  
Obituary's rain down  
It's our fate  
We're lying naked face down  
  
Oh  
  
All together decapitated  
Can you see me grab ?  
Living with the dead god dammit  
All together being dismantled  
  
Love song for the dear departed  
Head stone for the broken hearted  
I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal  
Head trip for the mortal earth bound  
One sip of the blood that i've found  
Lying here  
I'm dying here (dying here)  
  
Don't bring me daffodil's  
Bring a boquet of pills  
Straight through like radium  
Cracked through the cranium  
Protect me when you can  
Respect me when i am DYING  
  
A song for the dear departed  
Head stone for the broken hearted  
I was to kill, for flowers to steal  
Head trip for the mortal earth bound  
One sip of the blood that i've found  
Lying here  
I'm dying here
