Even though it's been so long  
My love for you keeps going strong  
I remember the things that we used to do  
A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through  
I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you  
  
Chorus:  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy  
Ever since you went away  
Every hour of every day  
  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy  
No matter what I say or do  
There's just no getting over you  
  
I can see the love shining in your eyes  
And there comes a such a sweet surprise  
If seeing's believing it's worth the wait  
So hold and tell me it's not too late  
We're so good together, we starting forever now  
  
Chorus  
  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you baby  
Love like ours will never end  
Just touch me and we're there again  
  
Just one night  
And we'll have that magic feeling like we used to do  
Hold on tight and whatever comes our way we gonna make it through  
It seems believing is worth the wait  
So hold and tell me it's not too late  
We're so good together, we starting forever now  
  
Chorus  
  
And I miss you, I missed you  
All the tender love you gave me  
A feeling gets this strong  
You know the real thing's come along  
And I miss you  
  
I miss you like crazy baby  
Only your sweet love can save me  
I miss you like crazy  
A love like ours will never end  
Just touch me and we're there again  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy  
No matter what I say or do
