I'm a battleship, frozen by my mothers anger  
Anchored in the North Pole Sea  
I'm a sphinx, stamped on the Hilton poster  
Hoping to see the desert  
  
I'm a woman without country or state  
Opening her head to the universe  
Hundred thousand people in me  
Everyday they're growing, everyday they're feeling  
  
He's an infant, blinded from his mothers sorrow  
Crawling in the bleeding sky  
He's a building, floating in spring air  
Hoping to open his windows  
  
He's a man, bound on earth soil  
Reaching his hands to the universe  
Hundred thousand people in him  
Everyday they're feeling, everyday they're growing  
  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing together  
Reaching each other  
  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing together  
Reaching each other
