When I've got something to say,  
Well, don't I always let you know?  
So that you and I can go my way together.  
And if I get carried away,  
Well, I could be sailing on a song  
And maybe we could carry on forever.  
But lately this old dog has been chasing his tail  
Round and round and round.  
And the circles in my mind,  
They have been winding slowly down.  
Everybody's breezing up but I'm seizing up,  
I'm freezing up and I'm fading away.  
I've got a hold on a night in June,  
I've got room for you and me.  
I've got moonlight up in the trees,  
I've got sixty-eight degrees.  
I've got nothing on my mind  
But I've got loving in my heart,  
And I've got something out in the garden  
I want to show you.  
Well, it really doesn't matter after all  
If we quit this round about  
And no one will really notice  
If we can just sit this next one out.  
  
You can strike up the band without me,  
You may have your doubts about me,  
But I'm just fading away.  
You can hardly even see me  
Because I'm fading away.  
Well, it's hard to find a label  
For this feeling in my bones.  
That this is all a make-believe  
But my cards are on the table  
And there ain't nothing up my sleeve.  
  
And here I thought I was a thinking man  
But I'm a shrinking man, I'm sinking man,  
I'm fading, fading away.  
Well, it's really not so bad  
To be fading away.  
Come on along with me  
And we'll go fading away.  
You can hardly even hear me  
Because I'm fading away.
