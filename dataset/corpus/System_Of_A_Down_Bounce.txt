Jump, bounce, down, up  
  
I went out on a date,  
With a girl, a bit late,  
She had so many friends,  
Gliding through many hands.  
I brought my pogo stick,  
Just to show her a trick,  
She had so many friends,  
Gliding through many hands.  
  
Jump pogo,  
Bounce pogo,  
Down, up  
Jump, bounce, up, down  
  
Unannounced twister games,  
All players with no names,  
They lined up double quick,  
But just one pogo stick,  
Everyone gets to play,  
Runaway, expose',  
It was so exotic,  
But just one pogo stick.  
  
Jump pogo,  
Bounce pogo,  
Down, up  
Jump, bounce, up, down  
  
Oh, I'd like to spread you out,  
Touching whoever's behind  
  
Jump pogo,  
Bounce pogo,  
Down, up  
Jump, bounce, up, down  
Bounce pogo,  
Down pogo, up pogo
