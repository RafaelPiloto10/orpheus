Feelin' like it's all over, feelin' like there's no love  
Feelin' like it's not easy, breathin' life in the dust  
On a countdown to zero take a ride on the nightmare machine  
  
There ain't gonna be heroes  
There ain't gonna be anything  
Oh  
Here it comes, here comes the night  
Here it comes, hell in the night  
Here it comes, here comes the night  
  
When we all fall down  
When we walk into silence  
When we shadow the sun  
When we surrender to violence  
Oh  
Then the damage is done  
Put away that gun!  
  
I don't want to be there  
I don't want to be anywhere  
Oh!  
  
That's right!  
We're fightin' for the gods of war but what the hell we fightin' for?  
We're fightin' with the gods of war but I'm a rebel  
  
And I ain't gonna fight no more no way!  
On a countdown to zero  
Take a ride on the nightmare machine  
There ain't gonna be heroes  
(Whoa)  
There ain't gonna be anything  
No!  
  
That's right!  
We're fightin' for the gods of war but what the hell we fightin' for?  
We're fightin' with the gods of war but I'm a rebel  
  
Don't ya know that's right  
  
And (a) I ain't gonna fight no more  
  
(Stop)  
Stop fightin' for the gods of war  
(Stop fightin' for the gods of war)  
Yeah what the hell we fightin' for?  
(What in the hell we fightin' for?)  
We're fightin' with the gods of war  
Heavy!
