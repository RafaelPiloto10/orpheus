I'm lookin' for a way to feel you hold me  
Feel your heartbeat just one more time  
Reaching back, trying to touch the moment  
Each precious moment that you were mine  
  
How do you prepare when you love someone this way  
To let them go a little more each day  
  
The stars we put in place  
The dreams we didn't waste  
The sorrows we embraced  
The world belonged to you and me  
The oceans that we crossed  
The innocense we lost  
The hurting at the end  
I'd go there again  
'Cause it was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
So this is missing you is overwhelming  
When it hits me  
You're not coming back  
And in my darkest hours I have wondered  
Was it worth it, for the time we had  
My thoughts begun to hear you  
But one thing I know is true  
I'll bless the day that I found you  
  
The stars we put in place  
The dreams we didn't waste  
The sorrows we embraced  
The world belonged to you and me  
The oceans that we crossed  
The innocence we lost  
The hurting at the end  
I'd go there again  
'Cause it was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
The rules we stepped aside  
The fear that we defied  
The thrill of the ride  
The fire in our hearts that burned  
The oceans that we crossed  
The innocence we lost  
The hurting at the end  
I'd go there again  
'Cause it was beautiful  
It was beautiful
