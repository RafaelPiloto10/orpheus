Darkness had us covered  
When we split from Minnesota in the morning  
In the rain  
  
Black as I was feeling  
And the street was slick and shiny as a snake  
Each of us was a-humming to a half forgotten echo  
Hangin' over in the brain  
  
Tappin' time and thinking of the time we never had the time to take  
Losing to the rising cost of living high and loving hard  
And leavin' every yesterday behind  
  
Learning every bridge you cross,  
Is burning down before you're off and  
Running  
Like the devil just in time  
  
Breakin' any ties before they bind you  
Taking any comfort you can find  
Running like you're running out of time  
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding  
When you're headin' for the border lord  
You're bound to cross the line  
  
Good lookin' women every time you stumble  
Waitin' there to catch you when you fall  
Gettin' to you bad enough to let em  
  
Keep you backin' up  
Till just before your back's against the wall  
  
Breakin' any ties before they bind you  
Takin' any comfort you can find  
Runnin' like you're runnin' out of time  
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding  
When you're headin' for the border lord  
You're bound to cross the line
