I'm holding out and I'm holding on  
To every letter and every song  
I pulled myself out of the day we ever had to meet  
Are you through with me?  
  
And when it all goes to hell  
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face?  
  
I'm all ears and I'm all scars  
To hear you tell me "Boys like you who try too hard to look not quite as
desperate"  
I'm hanging on  
But I still know the way to make your makeup run  
so  
  
And when it all goes to hell  
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face?  
  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
  
When it all goes to hell  
When it all goes to hell  
When it all goes to hell
