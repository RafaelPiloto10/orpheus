Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
You take my body  
I give you heat  
You say you hungry  
I give you meat  
I suck your mind  
You blow my head  
Make love - (make love)  
Inside your bed - everybody get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
  
Every time I get hot  
You wanna cool down  
Every time I get high  
You say you wanna come down  
You say it's enough  
In fact it's too much  
Every time I get a - get down, get down  
Get down, make love  
  
Oh, sss, hah  
  
I can squeeze - you can shake me (get down, make love)  
I can feel - when you break me (get down, make love)  
Come on so heavy - when you take me (get down, make love)  
You can make love, you can make love, you can make love, you can make love  
(Get down, make love)  
You can make everybody get down, make love  
Get down, make love  
  
Every time I get high  
You wanna come down  
Every time I get hot  
You say you wanna cool down  
You say it's enough  
In fact it's too much  
Every time I wanna, get down  
Get down, get down  
  
Aah, ooh, make love, make love, make love, make love, make love  
Aah, oh

Every time I get high  
You say you wanna come down  
You say it's enough  
In fact it's just too much  
Every time I wanna, get down
