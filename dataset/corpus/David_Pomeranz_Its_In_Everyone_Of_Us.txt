It's in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes,  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why,  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by  
It's in everyone of us  
To be wise,  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes,  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why,  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by  
  
It's in everyone of us  
I just remembered  
It's like I been sleeping for years,  
I'm not awake as I can be  
But my seeing is better,  
I can see  
Through the tears,  
I've been realising that,  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show,  
There is scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands,  
Who all know  
What I know,  
And it's good  
That it's so  
  
It's in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes,  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why,  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by,  
It's in everyone of us  
By and by
