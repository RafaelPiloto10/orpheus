She's blood, flesh and bone  
No tucks or silicone  
She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound  
But somehow I can't believe  
That anything should happen  
I know where I belong  
And nothing's gonna happen, yeah.  
  
Cause she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely.  
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Do, do, do, do do  
She's so high, high above me.  
  
A first class and fancy free,  
She's high society,  
She's got the best of everything.  
What could a guy like me ever really offer?  
She's perfect as she can be,  
Why should I even bother --- Aha  
  
Cause she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely  
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Do, do, do, do do  
She's so high, high above me  
  
She comes to speak to me,  
I freeze immediately,  
Cause what she says sounds so unreal,  
Somehow I can't believe,  
That anything should happen  
I know where I belong  
And nothing's gonna happen, yeah ah ah  
  
Cause she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely  
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc or Aphrodite  
Oh yeah ah ah  
She's so high, high above me, oh yeah
