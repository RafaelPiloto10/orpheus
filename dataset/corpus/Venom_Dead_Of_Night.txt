Death throes the seeds of lightning  
Thunder cast in rain  
Castrate humanity  
The woman smells the game  
Complete in time intact  
And weave another year  
Demand apocalypse  
And do not despair  
IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT  
Danger approaches hold on tight  
Ye ancient souls  
The hounds are pacing  
Out in distant roles  
Bring in the alchemist  
And screaming mortal witch  
Sample the moonlight  
And dance with the bitch  
In the dead of the night  
Children start to die  
In a manger of blood  
Dead is the night  
Death sows the seeds of lightning  
Thunder cast in rain  
Castrate humanity  
The woman smells the game  
Complete in time intact  
And weave another year  
Hold your heads up high  
Do not despair
