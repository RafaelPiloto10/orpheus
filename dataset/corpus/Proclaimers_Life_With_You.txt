When I was a younger man  
When I was a silly boy  
I didn't need a thing, I  
Was strong as anything, I  
Viewed solitude as a joy  
  
But since I met you I'm distraught  
You wandered in and now I'm caught  
I never thought I would see  
Someone so truly good  
Some one who's so everything I'm not  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Don't want to live all alone  
I can't conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
But what if, what if, what if what  
If it's not perfect then it's not  
But every care I'll take  
Nothing I won't forsake  
To dwell beside what you've got  
  
Every time I think about you  
I think I can't live with you  
I'll tell you something  
I am nothing without you  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Don't want to live all alone  
I can't conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
(Hey!)  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Don't want to live all alone  
I can't conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
Without you in our home
