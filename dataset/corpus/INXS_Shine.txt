Making up my life  
Killer in the night  
Rattling my brains  
Looking for that light  
Shine, shine  
Ah shine so bright, shine  
  
When she does that thing  
I want to breathe her in  
Throw away my world  
If I could see that pearl  
  
Shine, shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine  
  
The skin is deep  
But you're oh so weak  
Don't put your faith  
In the words they speak  
  
The skin is deep  
But you're so so weak  
Don't put your faith  
In the words they speak  
  
Gimme gimme reasons for the things I do  
Silhouette I'm seeing in the shape of you  
  
Gimme gimme reasons for the things I do  
Silhouette I'm seeing in the shape of you  
  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine  
  
When it does that thing  
Killer in the night  
Rattling my brains  
Looking for the light  
  
Shine, shine, shine, ssshine  
Shine, shine, so bright  
  
Gimme gimme reasons for the things I do  
The silhouette I'm seeing in the shape of you
