Fish and Chips  
A little coke and you, oh, babe  
Honey drips  
Two more to go, oh, babe  
Let's go on back  
The trip will be groovy, oh, babe  
Jump in the sack  
Flip your mood, oh, babe  
Come to me  
I really do love you, oh, babe  
Honey, honey  
Honey dripper too, oh, babe  
Loved you before  
I loved you a long, long time, my love  
Loving you more  
Then I got to have more of  
Fish and chips
