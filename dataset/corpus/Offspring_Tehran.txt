In your plane in the blue sky  
You roam again  
Words that echo in your mind  
Make your heart beat faster  
This is no Vietnam  
We will win in Iran  
  
The Captain said kill or die  
Islam be damned  
Make your last stand  
In Tehran  
  
Warrior, the time bombs  
About to go  
What will you feel  
Will you even wonder  
If the man that's in your sights  
Ever kissed his girl goodbye  
  
The President said let it ride  
Islam be damned  
Make your last stand  
In Tehran  
  
Great Satan  
Our flags our burning  
  
Soon America may find  
Its young men in the sand  
Where there casualty  
Is just a number  
In Iran  
  
The President said let it ride  
You will be damned  
Make your last stand  
In Tehran
