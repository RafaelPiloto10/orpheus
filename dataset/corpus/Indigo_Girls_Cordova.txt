The volunteers come for your prayers  
And some souvenirs,  
With ivory skin and boycott lessons  
Year after year.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I'm tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk,  
Oh Cordova.  
Where I cried and I cried,  
I knew I was trading on things that I didn't have,  
The things that I didn't have.  
  
Now you come to me  
With revolution's infidelity,  
With blacklisted friends and Tupperware kin,  
And your big history.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I memorize the lullabies  
Of dwindling lives.  
The lay of the land, the touch of each hand  
We lose by and by.  
  
[Chorus]
