You are always in my heart  
Even though you're far away  
I can hear the music of the song I sang to you  
You are always in my heart  
And when skies above are gray  
I remember that you care and then and there the sun breaks through  
Just before I go to sleep  
There's a rendezvous I keep  
And the dreams I always meet help me forget we're far apart  
I don't know exactly when dear  
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear  
And my darling 'til we do  
You are always in my heart  
And the dreams I always meet help me forget were far apart  
I don't know exactly when dear  
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear  
And my darling 'til we do  
You are always in my heart
