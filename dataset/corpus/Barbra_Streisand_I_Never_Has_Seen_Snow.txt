I done lost my ugly spare  
I am cheerful now  
Got the warmth all over  
To smoother my worried brow  
Oh, the girl I use to be  
She ain't me no more  
I closed the door  
On the girl I was before, hmm  
Feelin' fine and full of bliss  
What I really wanna say is this  
I never has seen snow  
All the same I know  
Snow ain't so beautiful  
Can't be so beautiful  
Like my love is  
Like my love is  
Nothin' do compare  
Nothin' anywhere with my love  
A hundred things I see  
A twilight sky, that tree  
But none so beautiful  
Not one so beautiful  
Like my love is  
Like my love is  
Once you see his face  
None can take the place of my love  
A stone rolled of my heart  
When I laid my eyes on that  
Near to me boy with that far away look  
And right from the start I saw a new horizon  
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took  
Needed to be took  
Needed to be took  
Oh, oh  
I never have seen snow  
All the same I know  
Nothin' will ever be  
Nothin' can ever be  
Beautiful as my love is  
Like my love is to me  
Nothin' is as beautiful to me
