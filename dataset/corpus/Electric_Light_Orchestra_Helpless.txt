Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
  
I thought about it but I couldn't think of what to say  
But I thought about it anyway, yeah  
I tried to tell you what you mean to me  
But it didn't come so easily, no  
  
I never reckoned  
For more than a second  
Just how it would be on my own  
  
I'd be helpless, without you  
I'd be helpless, without you  
  
The dawn that calls beyond the night  
Tells its old story  
The shadows fade into the light  
In all it's glory  
  
Helpless  
Helpless, baby, I'm a helpless  
Helpless, baby  
I'm a helpless  
  
If I could put a good shine on the past  
Do you think that we could make it last, oh yeah  
Seems to mind the time goes fast  
I wonder if the vote is cast  
  
Now that you mention it  
Got my attention  
I quite clearly blew me away  
  
I'd be helpless, without you  
I'd be helpless, without you  
  
The dawn that calls beyond the night  
Tells its old story  
The shadows fade into the light  
In all it's glory  
  
Helpless  
Helpless, baby, I'm a helpless  
Helpless, baby  
I'm a helpless, without you  
I'd be helpless, without you  
  
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
