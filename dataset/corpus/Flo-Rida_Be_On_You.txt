I said excuse me little mama if I may  
Take this thought and send it your way  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say  
I wanna be on you, on you  
I wanna be on you, on you  
And if you don't like that, then send it right back  
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say  
Sh-sh-shawty with no limits, that's what I need all the time  
I'm w-w-with it, she with it, she not sure she put it down  
Come g-g-get it, the business, I h-h-hit it, whose is it?  
The Benz with the windows tinted, go on, lock it, dirty south  
Shown in like them grown men, Goose, Patron, gin  
L-let me go on in, sexy moanin', see-catch me jonesin'  
N-no not never ever witnessed little mama off schedule  
Got me achy, call me papi, hot as saki, fly as feathers  
be-but robbed that, sh-shawty house staked, g-got that prowl cat  
I wanna pop it like ecstasy, pretty face and all that  
But what I look for, this gal is hood core, be-baddest outdoors  
Deserve a encore, the definition of a show  
I said excuse me little mama if I may  
Take this thought and send it your way  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say  
I wanna be on you, on you  
I wanna be on you, on you  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say  
Hey, I'm feeling you girl, wanna get close to you, no doubt  
My s-s-swagger should tell it more than anything can vouch  
Little mama you are what's happening, ghetto fine, I'll make you proud  
So stunt-alicious, I love it, let's at least work something out  
Miss Thang, million dollar game, Coke bottle frame  
Make my wall of fame, let me know your name, I control the rain  
I can make it better, matter of fact I'll make it wetter  
Stormy weather with this cheddar all because you hot as ever  
If you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby  
You won't like it, send it back, I-it's okay baby  
You's a keeper, such a diva, give me your fever  
If I could freak ya, give me the word, I mean no harm  
I said excuse me little mama if I may  
Take this thought and send it your way  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say  
I wanna be on you, on you  
I wanna be on you, on you  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say  
Girl, let me touch you like nobody can  
Girl, let me show you I'm a gentleman  
I wanna be the one to hold your hand  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be  
Girl, let me touch you like nobody can  
I wanna show you I'm a gentleman  
Girl, let me be the one to hold your hand  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be  
I said excuse me little mama if I may  
Take this thought and send it your way  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say  
I wanna be on you, I wanna be on you  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say  
I said excuse me little mama if I may  
Take this thought and send it your way  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say  
I wanna be on you, I wanna be on you  
And if you don't like that then send it right back  
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say  
Be on you, why-why-you
