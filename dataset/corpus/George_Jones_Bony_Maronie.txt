Thank you very much  
We've got a request for a fast one.  
We don't usually do rock and roll numbers  
But I don't know but about a verse of this one  
But I'll do it. It goes like this.  
  
Well, I got a gal named bony moronie  
Well, she's got a neck like a stick of macaroni  
You outta see her rock and rollin' with her blue jeans on  
Makin' love underneath the silvery moon.  
  
I love her, and she loves me  
And both as happy as we can be  
Makin' love underneath the apple tree.  
  
Well, I got a gal named bony moronie  
Yeah, She's got a leg like a stick of macaroni  
You outta see her rock and rollin' with her blue jeans on  
Makin' love under the silvery moon  
  
I love her, and she loves me  
Makin' love underneath the apple tree.  
  
Makin' love underneath the apple tree.  
Makin' love underneath the apple tree.  
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
