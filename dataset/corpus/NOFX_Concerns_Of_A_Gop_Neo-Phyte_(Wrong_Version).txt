Truth  
Now like a viral infection  
The GOP developed a vaccine  
Get your shot from your local Christian reading room  
Make sure your clothes are blue and neoprene  
  
Windows closed,  
Televisions on,  
Talk show radio  
Where everyone agrees  
The plague is here,  
But exposure is avoidable  
Turn up mind, relinquish control  
  
Question!  
Citizens questioning leader  
Don't want to set a precedent  
We're going ask all the questions  
Like what kind of patriot are you?  
When did you check out the Trotsky?  
What is your major malfunction?!  
  
Traitor!  
To the lord and creator  
Fucking communist faggot  
An infidel living among us  
Procreating liberal hippie  
Disgrace yourself and your country  
Why don't you love it or leave it?!  
  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking clearly  
My deepest apologies  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking of me  
I wasn't thinking!  
  
Benevolence blinded  
Tolerance indicted  
Why don't you love it or leave it?
