Come along let's park (let's park)  
Can't you see what's going on  
Come along gotta get with it  
You're space bound and going strong  
And he said  
Come along lets rock  
Shake your body don't stop  
Cause I'm never out of fuel  
You're good at talkin'  
But at listenin' you ain't so cool  
So you better get with it baby  
Chorus  
Earth to Mickey  
When are you gonna land?  
Earth to Mickey  
When are you gonna land?  
(Why can't you just come on down,  
Down to my level here)  
Tonight I'm watchin' you  
And you wouldn't understand  
How could you ever get so spaced out  
And never ever land  
I just wanna tell you  
You're outta your mind  
It'll take a little time  
But I bet I can talk you down  
There are unnurtured treasure  
Right here on solid ground  
So you better get with it baby  
Repeat chorus  
(Hear me talkin' to ya mickey)  
Mickey's rap:  
Excuse me but it's hard to hear  
Cause I'm way up in the stratosphere  
I caught your drift  
But I still don't see  
I changed my long distance company recently  
I'm not a guy that's kinda shy  
I gotta get home before my goldfish die  
My friends say I caught your eye  
They say you like the way I tie my tie  
I don't know why you wanna stare  
Don't touch...i just combed my hair  
(push)  
Please talk me down  
Where's the ground?  
Hold on you better slow down  
You might be 'fore your time  
I think you got kicked out  
From the white school of bump and grind  
Mickey come along let's walk  
Can we have a little talk?  
You've been busted in mid-flight  
Whenever you're puzzled you just  
Put on your big red light  
Chaka's rap:  
You know I know what they mean now  
When they say that you're all dressed up  
And nowhere to go  
Mickey really I been tryin to talk to you  
All night I've been lookin at you  
And lookin at you  
And tryin to talk and talk  
But you just don't listen  
You're on some eternal flight  
I just can't seem to make you make sense  
Mickey, Mickey  
Repeat chorus  
Ad lib to fade
