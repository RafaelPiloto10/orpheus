Mama, you gave life to me  
Turned a baby, into a lady  
And mama, all you had to offer  
was a promise of a lifetime of love  
Now I know, there is no other  
Love like a mother's  
Love for her child  
and I know  
a love so complete  
something  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my hear to hear you say goodbye  
  
Mama, you gave love to me  
Turned a young one  
Into a woman  
and mama, all I ever needed  
was a guarantee of you loving me  
  
Cuz I know  
there is no other  
love like a mother's  
love for her child  
and it hurts so  
that something so strong  
  
must say goodbye  
  
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear  
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near  
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry  
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
Well the love you give  
  
You'll always be there everytime I call  
You ought to be the greatest love of all  
You take my weakness and you make me strong  
And I will always love 'till forever comes
