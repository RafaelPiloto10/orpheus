Over Bridges of Sighs  
To rest my eyes in shades of green  
  
Under Dreaming Spires  
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been  
  
What did you do there? - I got high  
What did you feel there? - Well I cried  
But why the tears there? - I'll tell you why - yyyyy  
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful  
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful  
  
I feel inclined to blow my mind  
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun  
They all come out to groove about  
Be nice and have fun in the sun  
I'll tell you what I'll do - What will you do?  
  
I'd like to go there now with you  
You can miss out school - Won't that be cool  
Why go to learn the words of fools?  
  
What will we do there? - We'll get high  
What will we touch there? - We'll touch the sky  
But why the tears there? I'll tell you why  
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful  
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful  
  
I feel inclined to blow my mind  
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun  
They all come out to groove about  
Be nice and have fun in the sun  
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful  
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful
