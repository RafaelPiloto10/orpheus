From the highest tower,  
I will call you home.  
It's the same old story,  
love will find its own (oh).  
  
You come to me, conspiracy of the night.  
The heart that you want just happens to be mine.  
Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains  
but you wind up on my side, and what will be will be.  
  
That you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit.  
The face of a friend invisible on the street.  
If you are battling to be mine, I'm victorious in defeat  
and I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.  
  
Anybody want me, anyone know my name.  
Do it in a lifetime,  
you be dust and the soul survives.  
Evens up the score (ah).  
  
From the highest tower,  
I will call you home.  
It's the same old story,  
love will find its own.  
  
And I surrender,  
take me for all time.  
Love that lasts forever,  
and I surrender.  
  
We are elite, prisoners of the night.  
We fight to the finish and savour the delights.  
It's your body that got me beat, and I'm crumbling at your feet,  
I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.  
  
(I surrender)  
I will walk through fire to keep you safe and sound (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh no),  
and I surrender, take me for all time.  
  
You are the air that I breathe (oh)  
  
I will walk through fire, keep you safe and sound.  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh).  
This is my life (life) story (story), I've been lost and found (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour (in the final hour), turn my life around (oh no).  
  
And I surrender (surrender),  
take me for all time.  
I surrender , ah  
love as warm as wine  
I surrender ah ah...
