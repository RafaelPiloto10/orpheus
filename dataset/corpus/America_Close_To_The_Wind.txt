Ah  
Lately, it hasn't been easy  
I've been wanderin' all night  
Searchin', tryin' to find an answer  
Why I'm in this situation  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Trying to keep my head above water  
Close to the wind, without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Everyday it just gets harder  
But you're all I need to survive  
For so long it felt like  
I was walking on the water  
I found the hard part  
Is waking without you in the morning  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
The weight of the world's on my shoulders (everyday now)  
Close to the wind, without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
The loneliness it's neverending (yes I'm falling)  
Open your heart, come aboard  
And if we're back together  
I know our love will be everlasting  
I still believe that there's a chance  
For us to have a happy ending  
Peace will reign on earth  
LIfe for all it's worth, oh yeah  
I pray every single morning  
That this time we will be much stronger  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Help me try to find a shelter (to protect you)  
Close to the wind without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
But inside it's safe and warm now (we're together)  
Don't be afraid of the storm  
I've been sailing close, close to the wind (been sailing in)  
(Close to the wind) Don't be afraid of the storm  
I've been sailing close, close to the wind (been sailing in)  
(Close to the wind) Don't be afraid of the storm ...
