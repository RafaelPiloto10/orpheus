I'm like a toy balloon  
And someone cruel has cut the string  
I'm drifting out of sight  
My head's too light to find a thing  
Oh baby, life is like a cartoon movie  
Being with you makes it groovy  
Everything you do is new to me  
  
And do you feel it too?  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do?  
Oh do you feel it too, do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you?  
  
I can't believe my ears  
You know I hear such crazy sounds  
Each time I talk to you  
And walk with you I'm off the ground  
Oh baby, love is great, you just can't top it  
Got the ball we mustn't drop it  
Girl there ain't a thing can stop it now  
  
And do you feel it too?  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do?  
Oh do you feel it too, do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you?  
Tell me baby  
  
Oh baby, life is like a cartoon movie  
Being with you makes it groovy  
Everything you do is new to me  
  
And do you feel it too?  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do?  
Oh do you feel it too, do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you?
