Every day, every day I have the blues,  
Every day, every day I have the blues,  
When you see me worried, baby, because it's you I hate to lose.  
  
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care,  
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care,  
Speaking of bad luck and trouble will you know I,ve had my share.  
  
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line,  
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, moving down the line,  
Well, there ain't nobody worryin' and there ain't nobody cryin'.  
Seems to me every day, every day I have the blues,  
Every day, every day I have the blues.
