My breath smells of a thousand fags  
And when I'm drunk I dance like me dad  
I've started to dress a bit like him  
  
Early morning when I wake up  
I look like kiss but without the make up  
And that's a good line to take it to  
The bridge  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow so before  
I'm old I'll confess  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
My bed's full of takeaways and fantasies  
Of easy lays  
The pause button's broke on my video  
And is this real 'cause I feel fake  
Oprah Winfrey Ricki Lake  
Teach me things I don't need to know  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And it's starting to show so before  
I'm old I'll confess  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
If I did it all again I'd be a nun  
The rain was never cold when I was young  
I'm still young we're still young  
Life's too short to be afraid  
Step inside the sun  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow  
  
And you know and you know  
'Cause my life's a mess  
And I'm trying to grow  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
You think that I'm strong you're wrong  
You're wrong  
I'll sing my song my song my song  
  
Life's too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You don't have to take the blame  
  
Life's too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You don't have to take the blame  
  
Life's too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You don't have to take the blame
