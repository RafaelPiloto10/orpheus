The future comes alive  
You speak Your word and I  
I'm running into Your hope  
Because I've seen Your light  
You bring my world to life  
I'm coming after Your love  
  
I'm not shaken  
I'm not letting go  
  
And everything comes alive  
In my life as we lift You higher  
Let Your freedom arise  
In our lives as we lift You up  
Sing it out  
Sing it out  
Your freedom is here  
  
So take the limits off  
No matter what the cost  
I'm running after Your call  
And I will run this race  
See You face to face  
So let Your power overflow  
  
I will not fear  
I will not hide Your love  
Your love  
All of my life  
I cannot deny Your love  
Your love
