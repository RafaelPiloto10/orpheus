In the car park  
In the lamplight  
Go for a walk  
Clock him shiv-fight  
Sodium-a-shine on  
All the faces white now  
And he got his Docs on  
Bottle out all right now  
  
As you might say  
Him super-tuff  
  
In the corner  
In the cold rain  
Sting like iodine  
In my brain  
Fist you til you fall down  
Hit him back make him mad  
Really hard. Really fast  
Have you ever been had?  
('cause he's having you now)  
  
Super-tuff  
But also tender
