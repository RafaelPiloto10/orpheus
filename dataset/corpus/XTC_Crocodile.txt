Crocodile  
No you won't make me jealous  
That she left me for him  
Scene one standing  
Crushed on landing  
You may have walked out  
But I'll swallow up my fate  
Scene two sitting  
Man in kitchen  
Bit cold and lifeless like  
The burger on my plate  
But there's one emotion I'm afraid of  
Hear him scratching gently to be fed  
I can't stand it when he sits there smiling  
I don't want him nesting in my head  
Crocodile  
No you won't make me jealous  
That she left me for him  
Get away  
Crocodile  
No you won't make me jealous  
I'm not letting you in  
Scene three lying (through his backteeth)  
Speared and dying (bitten beneath)  
I'll crawl the wall to hand there  
Skinned and stuffed with drink  
But there's one emotion I'm controlling  
Green eyed monster with his jaws spread wide  
(But he's your pet now  
You can't run away and hide)  
I can't stand it when he sits there crying  
I don't want to throw myself inside  
Crocodile  
Getaway  
(Crocodile  
With the jaded jealous smile)
