Saw you across the room  
Felt somethin' stir inside my soul  
Knew I'd never be the same  
Now that love had taken hold  
Then when you touched me  
There was no doubt  
You understood what my heart was all about  
  
And the rest is history  
The story of you and me  
For all eternity  
The record will show  
We'll fill up the pages  
Romance for the ages  
There for the world to see  
The rest is history  
  
Before we spoke a word  
My heart told me you were the one  
When you pressed your hand to mine  
I knew my life had just begun  
Like some old movie  
Music filled the night  
Lost held each other tight.  
  
And the rest is history  
The story of you and me  
For all eternity  
The record will show  
We'll fill up the pages  
Romance for the ages  
There for the world to see  
The rest is history  
  
And the rest is history  
The story of you and me  
For all eternity  
The record will show  
We'll fill up the pages  
Romance for the ages  
There for the world to see  
The rest is history  
  
History  
The rest is history.  
The rest is history.
