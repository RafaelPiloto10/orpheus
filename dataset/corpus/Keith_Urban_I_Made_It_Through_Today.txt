As I turn out the light and bow my head to pray  
The answered prayer I'm thankful for  
Is I made it through today  
  
Well her leavin' took it's toll on me  
And it took a lot of faith  
To find the strength to carry on  
But I made it through today  
  
Oh I was guilty of takin' her heart for granted  
Lettin' love slip through my hands  
'Til I was empty-handed  
And now I know how much I have and I ain't gonna lose it  
'Cause I've been given a second chance  
And I intend to use it  
  
I'm not tryin' to change the world  
I'm just tryin' to find my way  
And I still stumble now and then  
But I made it through today  
  
Whoa I was guilty of takin' this life for granted  
Lettin' time slip through my hands  
'Til I was empty-handed  
Now I know how much I have and I ain't gonna lose it  
'Cause I've been given a second chance  
And I intend to use it  
  
As I turn out the light and bow my head to pray  
The answered prayer I'm thankful for  
Is I made it through today  
Mmm-mmm I made it through today  
Mmm-mmm I made it through today  
Mm-hmm mm-hmm
