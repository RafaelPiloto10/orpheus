She'll bleed you dry  
She'll leave you there to die  
She'll cut you with a knife  
She'll carve away your life  
Yeah just like a wildcat  
She'll scratch you with her claws  
And if you try to leave her  
She'll stab you in the back  
  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Hell path no fury like a woman scorned!!!  
  
She's the kind of woman  
That's not hard to understand  
She cracks the whip and she holds the upper hand  
She'll bet ya, she'll mistreat ya  
Make you quiver and quail  
The female of the species is deadlier than the man  
  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Hell path no fury like a woman scorned!!!  
  
I know she's a demon but she answers to the name of woman  
Creature schooles in a dark desires and evil  
I jst be strong to resist this succubus  
Floating in orgies of passion  
She is my Goddess and I AM HER GOD  
  
On raven wings she glides into my bed  
Nocturnal rites, fear and passion wed  
Forbidden reason far below the sea  
Salvation shines from your divinity  
  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Hell path no fury like a woman scorned!!!  
HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
FIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN...OH WOMAN  
Oh take it away!!!  
The beauty of the sin, oh...  
Damnation...HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Blood, blood at the gates of hell  
Lover, virgin, demon, whore  
Dark pagan queen...demon, whore
