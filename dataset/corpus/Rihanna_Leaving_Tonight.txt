You left me down, with not a chance to fall  
My heart was on the line and I can't explain  
To everyone that I, that I fell so in love with you  
You left me waiting on the line  
  
Waiting for you  
That day was so difficult to cry myself to sleep  
I knew that you would wait for me, but I was wrong  
But I was wrong  
  
Why, leaving me tonight  
I pray it's only a while 'til she'll be back again  
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said  
Tonight alone again, why  
  
You came, the days grew dim for me  
I knew we would be, but I thought we would see it out  
For what we had was stronger than the things they knew  
We knew  
  
Why, leaving me tonight  
I pray it's only a while 'til she'll be back again  
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said  
Tonight alone again  
  
Righteous, righteous  
Leaving me tonight  
Righteous, righteous  
Don't leave me  
No, don't go tonight  
  
You'll see me walking away, I see you wanting to say  
I pray that you would see me for me, don't walk away  
  
And I will know that you are so true  
To all that I am, finding you  
  
And I want to get right, 'cause I don't walk around  
And I want to see tonight, and I know your sound  
It's like I've got to know, and I don't walk around  
If I could only get right, this time I know I could  
  
Why, leaving me tonight  
I know it's only a while 'til she'll be back again  
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said  
Tonight alone again, why  
  
Righteous, righteous  
Leaving me tonight  
Righteous, righteous  
Don't leave me tonight  
  
Right, right, right  
Righteous now, we pray
