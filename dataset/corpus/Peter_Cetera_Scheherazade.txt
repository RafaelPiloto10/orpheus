He was the sultan of Samarcand  
He had a harem of dancing girls at his command  
He owned all the eye could see  
Something was wrong, he wasn't happy  
And then it happened much to his surprise  
The loveliest woman he'd ever seen  
He asked her name and she replied  
Scheherazade  
  
She was the daughter of the Grand Vizier  
A real beauty with the heart of gold, she was so sincere  
She made a date with destiny  
Marry the king, make him happy  
  
He was enchanted on their wedding night  
Just a captive under her spell  
Spending a thousand and one Arabian nights  
  
All of his body tingled with delight  
Hearing the stories she loved to tell  
She was a vision, such a lovely sight  
Scheherazade  
  
He made a promise on the morning star  
He would change, throw away his scimitar  
So she came to stay  
And that's the why the story goes  
Until this very day
