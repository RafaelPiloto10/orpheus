Things just haven't been the same  
Since the flying saucer came  
Now the aliens are on the loose  
  
Well, we tried to hold 'em back  
Tried to ward off their attack  
But our atom bombs were just no use  
  
They were ugly, they were mean  
Biggest heads I ever seen  
They made everybody scream and shout  
  
First they leveled Tokyo  
Then New York was next to go  
Boy I really wish they'd cut it out  
  
They wasted everybody on my block  
There goes the neighborhood  
They'll zap you with their death ray eyes  
And blow you up real good  
  
Run for your lives  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
They're not very nice to the human race  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
  
There's more comin' every day  
And they just won't go away  
Now they're reproducing in the sewers  
  
They got slimy lizard skin  
And an evil lookin' grin  
And they sure could use some manicures  
  
They got hands all covered with fungus  
They got eyes like some kinda bug  
I sure hope they don't come in here  
I just shampooed the rug  
  
Run for your lives  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
  
They're really makin' a mess of this place.  
(Slime creatures)  
(Slime creatures)  
  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
  
They'll rip your head off just for fun  
They'll paralyze your mind  
They're wearin' out their welcome  
  
I don't think I like their kind  
They'll suck your brain out through a straw  
You just can't trust those guys  
  
So hide the children, lock the doors  
And always watch the skies  
Look out, here come the  
  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
They're an intergalactic disgrace  
  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
I wish they'd just get outta my face  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
(Slime creatures from outer space)  
  
They're makin' a big fat mess of this place  
(Slime creatures)  
(Slime creatures)  
  
Oh, where did they come from?  
What do they want from us?  
Who do they think they are?  
(Slime creatures, slime creatures)  
  
Why don't they leave me alone?  
(Slime creatures, slime creatures.)  
They're really getting on my nerves
