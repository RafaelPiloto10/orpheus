The holly and the ivy,  
When they are both full grown,  
Of all the trees that are in the wood,  
The holly wears the crown.  
  
[Chorus:]  
O the rising of the sun,  
The running of the deer,  
The playing of the merry organ,  
Sweet singing in the choir  
Sweet singing in the choir.  
The holly bears a blossom  
  
As white as lily flower  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To be our sweet Savior  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The holly bears a berry  
As red as any blood  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To do poor sinners good.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The holly bears a prickle  
As sharp as any thorn  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
On Christmas day in the morn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The holly bears a bark  
As bitter as any gall  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
For to redeem us all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The holly and the ivy,  
When they are both full grown,  
Of all the trees that are in the wood,  
The holly wears the crown.  
  
[Chorus]
