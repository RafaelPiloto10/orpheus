You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply,  
As time goes by  
  
An' when two lovers woo, they still say "I love you,"  
On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings,  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight an' love songs never out of date,  
Hearts full of passion, jealousy an' hate,  
Woman needs man and man must have his mate,  
That no one can deny  
  
It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,  
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by  
  
It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,  
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,
