i see her in the shadows  
its not my fault shes showering  
i touch myself because of the way she move  
next she is toweling  
  
ohhh  
is it wrong to watch her  
is it wrong to wanna hold her  
is it wrong to touch myself  
while thinking about her

she is like a drug  
she makes me feel good  
i need her by my side  
so i can touch her  
my baby

is it wrong to want  
is it wrong to need  
i touch myself
