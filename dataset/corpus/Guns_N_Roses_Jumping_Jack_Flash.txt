I was born in a cross-fire hurricane  
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain,  
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!  
But it's all right. I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash,  
It's a Gas! Gas! Gas!  
  
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag,  
I was schooled with a strap right across my back,  
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!  
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash,  
It's a Gas! Gas! Gas!  
  
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead.  
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled.  
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head.  
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!  
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash,  
It's a Gas! Gas! Gas!  
  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash
