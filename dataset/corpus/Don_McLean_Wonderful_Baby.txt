Wonderful baby livin' on love  
The sandman says maybe he'll take you above,  
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows,  
Where babies float by just  
Counting their toes.  
Wonderful baby nothin' but new  
The world has gone crazy, I'm glad I'm not you.  
At the beginning or is it the end?  
It goes in and comes out and starts over again.  
Wonderful baby livin' on love  
The sandman says maybe he'll take you above,  
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows,  
Where babies float by, just  
Counting their toes.  
Wonderful baby I'll watch while you grow.  
If I knew the future you'd be first to know.  
But I don't know nothin' of what  
Life's about  
Just as long as you live, you'll never find out.  
Wonderful baby, nothin' to fear.  
Love whom you will, but doubt what you hear.  
They'll whisper sweet things to make untrue.  
So be good to yourself, that's all  
You can do.  
Wonderful baby, livin' on love the sandman says maybe he'll  
Take you above,  
Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows,  
Where babies float by, just counting their toes,  
Where babies float by, just counting their toes  
Oh.
