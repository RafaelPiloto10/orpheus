Dream along with me, I'm on my way to a star  
Come along, come along, leave your worries where they are  
Up and beyond the sky, watchin the world roll by  
Sharin a kiss, a sigh, just use your imagination!  
  
On a cloud of love, well hear the music of night  
We can wink at the moon as we hold each other tight  
And if we go in the right direction, heaven can't be very far  
Dream along with me, I'm on my way to a star!  
(We can wink at the moon  
As we hold each other tight... )  
And if we go in the right direction, heaven can't be very far  
Dream along with me, I'm on my way to a star!
