I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt that's on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me  
You're like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I love the places that we go  
And I love the people that you know  
And I love the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row  
I love the powder on your nose  
  
Ouh, and now I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And now I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
I like the freckles on your chest  
And I like the way you like me best  
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test  
  
I like the white stains on your dress  
And I love the way you pass the check  
And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)  
  
And I love your lack of self respect  
While you're passed out on the deck  
I love my hands around your neck  
  
Ouh and I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
Why not before, you never tried  
Gone for good, and this is it  
  
I like your pants around your feet

Ooh
