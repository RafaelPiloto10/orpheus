To pay or not to pay that is the question  
It refused to stay as it all turned grey  
Or William Shakespeare's receding hair  
  
Please excuse the pun, it's hair today, gone tomorrow  
So be thankful for what precious locks you have  
  
Toupee, or not toupee, that is the question  
And by the way, I just gotta say,  
Thank the Lord I'm not going bald  
  
And if I may quip, my curls and I  
Are just like heaven  
And rest assured, there'll be no parting there  
  
But should my head get bare like Frier Tuck  
Hard taste to swallow  
It makes me smile, 'cause I know just what I'd do  
  
Yeah if I had more wigs, than I knew what to do with  
I'd open a second hand store  
And if you ever went bald, you'd recall it  
'Cause I'd cleverly call it 'Rugs from me to you'
