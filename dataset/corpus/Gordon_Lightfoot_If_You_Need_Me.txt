If you want to know the reasons for  
The things I feel inside  
You can run away and hide if you want to  
But if you need me  
Show me a way to get through  
'Cause I've not see anyone like you  
Since I was a man  
  
If you want to know for certain  
What is written in my soul  
Where my wildest dreams unfold  
Like an endless stream  
If you need me  
Show me a way to walk tall  
'Cause I'd not seen anything at all  
Until I met you  
  
Sun lights up the seasons  
Blue eyes light up the night  
  
If you want to know the meaning of  
These feelings that's alright  
I could be with you tonight  
That's where I'd like to stay  
If you need me  
Show me a love that is true  
'Cause I've not seen a woman like you  
Since I was a man  
  
If you want to know what magic lies  
Beneath the willow blooms  
In each corner of each room  
Where my love has strayed  
If you need me  
Show me a way to walk tall  
'Cause I'd not seen anything at all  
Until I met you  
If you need me  
Show me a way to get through  
'Cause I've not seen anything like you  
Since I was a man
