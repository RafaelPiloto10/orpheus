When you're weary, feelin' small  
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all.  
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough  
And friends just can't be found.  
  
Like a bridge over troubled waters  
I will lay me down.  
Like a bridge over troubled waters  
I will lay me down.  
  
When you're down and out, when you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you.  
I'll take your part, oh when darkness comes  
And pain is all around  
  
Like a bridge over troubled waters  
I will lay me down.  
Like a bridge over troubled waters  
I will lay me down.  
  
Sail on children, sail on by  
Your time has come to shine, all their dreams are on their way  
See how they shine, oh when you need a friend  
I'm sailing right behind  
  
Like a bridge over troubled waters  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled waters,  
I will ease your mind.  
I'll ease your mind.
