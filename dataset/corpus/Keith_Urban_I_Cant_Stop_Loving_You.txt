So you're leaving  
In the morning  
On the early train  
I could say everything's alright  
I could pretend and say good bye  
  
Got your ticket  
Got your suitcase  
Got your leaving smile  
  
I could say that's the way it goes  
I could pretend and you won't know  
That I was lying  
'Cause I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
  
Though I try  
Took a taxi  
To the station  
Not a word was said  
I saw you walk across the road  
Maybe the last time, I don't know  
  
Feeling humble  
I heard a rumble  
On the railway track  
And when I hear the whistle blow  
I walk away and you don't know  
  
That I was lying  
'Cause I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
Though I try  
  
'Cause I can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
No, I can't stop loving you  
Though I try
