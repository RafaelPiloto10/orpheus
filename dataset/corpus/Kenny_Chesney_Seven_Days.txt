A Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand  
She said it was her first time to see the sea  
Helping her climb across those jetty rocks  
Was the first time I touched her hand  
  
The rain and the way that felt never let up all week  
By Thursday I knew everything about her  
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her  
  
The sidewalks, the streets were soaked  
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face  
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain  
And the way she called my name  
  
I've lived those seven days a thousand times  
Those seven days a thousand  
  
Time was like the tide, it came and went  
That old pier ran clear out into the mist  
My mind plays back that Tuesday night  
Again and again, and again  
  
I taste that saltwater taffy on her lips  
And Wednesday morning snuck in through the window  
We just laid there and listened to the waves come and go  
  
The sidewalks, the streets were soaked  
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face  
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain  
And the way she called my name  
  
I've lived those seven days a thousand times  
Those seven days a thousand  
  
Moments with her, now they're all a blur  
Except for every second and every word  
Every drop of rain, every single grain of sand  
  
The sidewalks, the streets were soaked  
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face  
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain  
And the way she called my name  
  
I've lived those seven days a thousand times  
Those seven days a thousand times  
  
Seven days a thousand times  
A thousand times  
Seven days a thousand times
