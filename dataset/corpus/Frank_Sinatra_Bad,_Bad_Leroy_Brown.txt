Now the south side of Chicago  
Is (it's) the baddest part of town  
And if you (you're gonna) go down there, you better (just) beware  
Of a man (cat) named Leroy Brown  
  
Now Leroy (Brown) he's trouble  
And he stands about six-feet-four  
All the downtown ladies call him treetop lover  
The studs they call him sir  
  
[Chorus]  
(Yeah) he's bad, bad Leroy Brown  
Meanest (baddest) man (cat) in the whole damn town  
Badder than old King Kong  
(And he's) meaner than a junkyard dog  
  
Now Leroy he's a gambler  
And he likes (digs) his (those) fancy clothes  
He likes to wave his (that great, big, big fat, shiny diamond ring)  
Under (in front of) everybody's nose  
  
He's got a custom Continental  
He's got an Eldorado too  
He's got a 22 (32) gun in his pocket for fun  
He's got a razor in his (the razor in the) shoe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Friday, 'bout a week ago  
Leroy shootin' dice  
And at the end (edge) of the bar sat (was) a lady (chick) named Dorris
(Morris)  
Man she sure looked nice  
  
And (well then) he laid his eyes upon her  
That's when the big scene (trouble soon) began  
And Leroy Brown he learned a lesson 'bout messin'  
With the wife of a jealous man  
  
[Chorus]
