I've been tryin' to get away  
To get away  
To leave this old town  
I've been tryin' to see my way  
To see my way  
So I won't be found  
  
Many times I've felt alone  
I've felt alone  
But that's all behind  
One thing I know  
I know  
One thing is that  
  
I know I have to go  
Got no dough  
Should I stay or should I go  
Gotta get away  
Don't want to stay  
Leavin' tomorrow by subway  
  
Some people, they tell me  
They tell me  
I've been here to long  
It don't compel me  
They tell me  
I just don't belong  
Sometimes I wonder  
I wonder  
What's right or what's wrong  
One thing I  
I know  
One thing is that  
  
I know I have to go  
Got no dough  
Should I stay or should I go  
Gotta get away  
Don't want to stay  
Leavin' tomorrow by subway  
  
I gotta get away  
Get away, get away, get away  
I gotta get away  
Yeah, baby get away, gotta, gotta, gotta get away  
Whoo, you've gotta get away
