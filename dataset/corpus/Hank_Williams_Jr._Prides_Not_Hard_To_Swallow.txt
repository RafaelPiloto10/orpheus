I wish you'd look who's crawling back to you I never thought I'd live to see
today  
I swore to you the day I left this time I'd go for good  
And I was even proud enough to tell myself I could  
But it took a lot of lonely nights to ever change my mind  
  
It took a lot of missing youth and things that I'd left behind  
Intending to keep going but the going it got too rough  
And pride's not hard to swallow once you chewed it long enough  
  
I know we won't always see eye to eye  
But if you'll take me back this time I'll really try  
So many things I could have done so much I failed to do  
I've never needed anyone as much as I need you  
And it took a lot of lonely nights...
