Patriots of the wasteland torching two hundred years  
Dragging my spirit back into the dungeon again  
Bring back crucification cry the moral death's head legion  
Using steel nails manufactured by the slaves in Asia  
  
You won't fall for that law and order is a baton in the rib  
You won't fall for that just like your mummy and your daddy did  
  
Blood inside a fountain pen wrote you out of life again  
Who knows any better than to kick and scratch under English weather  
From a chain gang to the mill.  
The mill that sits on top of the hill  
The fog drowned towns arr gonna have to fade  
The wrong side of the a scissor blade  
  
You won't fall for that law and order is a baton in the rib  
You won't fall for that just like your mummy and your daddy did  
I'll eat my hat I'm gonna be sick  
They own the pack while we play the three card trick  
  
Don't you remember the place  
Where we hid the ace?  
Yeah not thick but slick  
Now we all gotta play the three card trick
