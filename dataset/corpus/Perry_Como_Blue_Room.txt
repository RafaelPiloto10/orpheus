We'll have a blue room,  
A new room, for two room.  
Where every day's a holiday,  
Because you're married to me  
  
Not like a ball room,  
A small room, a hall room,  
Where I can smoke my pipe away,  
With your wee head upon my knee  
  
We will thrive on, keep alive on,  
Just nothing but kisses,  
With mister and missus,  
Own little blue chairs  
  
You sew your trousseau,  
and Robinson Crusoe,  
Is not so far from worldly cares,  
As our blue room, far away upstairs  
  
(They will thrive on, keep alive on,  
Just nothing but kisses  
With mister and missus,  
Own little blue chair  
  
She'll wear her trousseau,  
and Robinson Crusoe)  
Is not so far from worldly cares,  
As our blue room,  
Far away upstairs
