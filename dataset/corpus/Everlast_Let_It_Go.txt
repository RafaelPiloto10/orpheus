Change your look, cut your hair  
And I pretended like I don't care  
Your so lovely girl, stop crying  
Bite my lip, I close my eyes  
Try to tell myself your no prize  
Can't forget you girl but I'm tryin'  
No one else will ever be  
The things that you are to me girl  
Kind of special hey I ain't lying  
Bite your neck, I pull your hair  
You're so innocent and unaware  
I'm so lonely, I'm so scared girl  
I'm dying here  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt  
  
Grab your shoes, walk out the door  
Like you've done a thousand times before  
But you got nowhere you can go to  
Try to run girl but you can't hide  
All the voices deep down inside  
Repeat all them things that I told you  
You're steadily on my mind  
Girl spoonin' you from behind  
That's my favorite way that I hold you  
For every time I let you down  
For every tear that touched the ground  
For every sincere apology that I owe you girl  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt  
  
I've been loving you a little too long  
And still I keep holding on  
It's been a year since you been gone girl  
Check it out now  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt
