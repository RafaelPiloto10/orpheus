You see that mountain over there,  
yea, one of these days  
I'm going to climb that mountain.  
  
Oh play me some mountain music.  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play.  
Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway.  
  
Drift away like Tom Sawyer.  
Ride a raft with old Huck Finn.  
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle.  
Lay streaming again.  
  
Oh play me some mountain music.  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play.  
Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway.  
  
Swim across the river.  
Just to prove that I'm a man.  
Spend the day be'in lazy.  
Just be'in natures friend.  
Climb a long tall hickery.  
Bending over skin'n cats.  
Playing baseball with shired rocks.  
Using sawmill slats for bats.  
  
Play some back home come on music  
That comes from the heart.  
Play somethin with lots of feeling.  
'Cause that's where music has to start.  
  
Oh play me some mountain music.  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play.  
Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway.  
  
Hey hey  
  
Oh play me mountain music.  
Oh play me mountain music.  
Oh play me mountain music.  
Oh play.
