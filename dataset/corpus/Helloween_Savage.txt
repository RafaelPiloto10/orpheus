You hear the people talking you walk the wrong street  
Painting all things black and step on your feet  
Flabby stomach, styled hair, trousers full of air  
Their morality is real ours isn't there  
  
They don't know, no they can't see  
Our hearts close to the sun  
Different in our hearts filled with  
That faith we carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
They just call us savage  
That's what I like to be  
Let them call us savage  
Cause that's what we like to be  
  
See the people wonder we run in our direction  
Let the narrow-minded sleep we better do some action  
Across the universe you smell the smell of lies  
I'm trying to be the winner not the sacrifice  
  
They don't know, no they can't see  
Our hearts close to the sun  
Different in our hearts filled with  
That faith we carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See them run they know no fun  
And look what they have done  
In this world full of rules  
We look just like fools  
  
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me  
(Savage)  
We come close every day to the time table life  
So mart they start their backwards fight  
  
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me  
(Savage)  
One day they will drop the bomb  
Cause it's necessary to show the power  
One day they will give a shit on what you say  
  
They don't know, no they can't see  
Our hearts close to the sun  
Different in our hearts filled with  
That faith we carry on  
  
[Chorus]
