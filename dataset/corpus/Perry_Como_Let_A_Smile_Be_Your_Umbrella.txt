On a rainy day  
  
Just let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy, rainy day  
And if your sweetie cries, just tell her  
That a smile will always pay  
  
Whenever skies are gray  
Don't you worry or fret  
A smile will bring the sunshine  
And you'll never get wet  
  
So, let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy, rainy day  
  
Just let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy, rainy day  
And if your sweetie cries, just tell her  
That a smile will always pay  
  
Whenever skies are gray  
Don't worry or fret  
A smile will bring the sunshine  
And you'll never get wet  
  
So, let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy, rainy day  
  
Just let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy, rainy day  
On a rainy, rainy day  
On a rainy, rainy day
