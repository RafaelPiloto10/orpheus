Another day another chance to get it right  
Circumstances sabotage me in spite of what I try  
No matter what I do  
There's always something keeping me away from you  
  
I'd do anything to see your sweet smile  
An I'd go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isn't it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time, at this time, at this time  
  
Now I'm a girl who believes in destiny  
But I suppose I should face reality  
The timing's wrong, there's just too many obstacles  
To get together now would be impossible  
  
And what if fate has already played it's hand  
And there's no future left in the plan  
What if this is what lies in store  
It only makes me want you even more  
  
I'd do anything to see your sweet smile  
An I'd go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isn't it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time, at this time, at this time  
  
I'd do anything to see your sweet smile  
An I'd go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isn't it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time, at this time, at this time  
  
(Butterflies and moon beams are fragile things  
I guess that's the way it is with love too  
Sometimes it just doesn't work out)  
  
I'd do anything to see your sweet smile  
An I'd go anywhere to be with you for just awhile  
Isn't it funny how some things are meant to be  
There is no future here for you and me  
At this time, at this time, at this time
