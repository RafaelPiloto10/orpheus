I like it  
Nu nu di di ty  
Let me let me see  
Nu di ty  
  
Hang your coat up, hang your coat up  
Lock the doors up, lock the doors up  
Let the steam rise in the spotlight (alright)  
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (tonight)  
Do your own thing with your own thing  
Whoo, shake a hip  
It's getting cool swing  
Ooh, ooh, guess who is watching now  
Look, looking, looking wow  
  
[Chorus]  
Flash it in fashion with me  
Skin to skin, body to body  
Dare to never, never let me see  
Nu-di-ty  
  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nu-di-ty  
  
Time to strip down  
Time to strip down  
Just pop that zipper for me  
And work that thing out  
Just expose it  
'Cause you know it's, alright (alright)  
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (tonight)  
Let it go, here we go  
Just let it slip inside  
That's right, here we go  
One button at a time  
Who cares who sees tonight?  
Look, looking, looking wow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nu-di-ty  
Nu-di-ty  
Never, never let me see  
Nu-di-ty  
Never, never see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nu-di-ty  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nu-di-ty
