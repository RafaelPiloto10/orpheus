(Remember, remember)  
Do you remember when I met you (Remember)  
Didn't the moon look big that night (Remember)  
Didn't you say my arms felt right about you (Remember)  
  
Don't you remember how I kissed you (Remember)  
Didn't you snuggle close to me (Remember)  
Didn't you say I'd never be without you (Remember)  
Now your love's grown cold as December  
  
And the blue skies have all turned to gray  
In my heart I will always remember  
All the love that we knew yesterday  
Don't you remember what you promised (Remember)  
  
Didn't we set a wedding day (Remember)  
Didn't you say you would wait  
Don't you remember (stop, stop, stop pretending)  
(Don't you remember it was springtime  
  
How all the roses were in bloom  
You had my picture upside down  
Remember  
And then there was the time that we made our plans about the future  
  
We said we'd really settle down  
We'd build a house out side of town  
(Remember)  
Now your love's grown cold as December  
  
And my blue skies have all turned to gray  
In my heart I will always remember  
All the love that we knew yesterday  
Don't you remember what you promised (Remember)  
  
Didn't we set a wedding day (Remember)  
Didn't you say you would wait  
Don't you remember (stop pretending, I remember)  
Remember
