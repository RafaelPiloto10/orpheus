Do you want to dance and hold my hand?  
Tell me baby I'm your lover man  
OH baby, do you want to dance?  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you do you do you do you want to dance  
Do you do you do you do you want to dance  
Do you do you do you do you want to dance  
  
Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?  
Squeeze me baby all through the night  
Oh baby, do you want to dance?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?  
Squeeze me baby all through the night  
Oh baby, do you want to dance
