One Drop Of Blood  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Standing in the courtroom  
When I heard, how do you plead?  
The accuser of the brethren  
Was staring at me  
He said, we got your number  
There is no escape  
For here are your transgressions,  
Your failures and mistakes  
He pointed to the corner  
Where the scales of justice stood  
I saw so many failures there  
There was nothing good  
And in that very moment  
When it seemed all hope was lost  
I said, I plead the blood of Jesus  
And his death upon the cross  
Chorus:  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered my transgressions  
And all the times I failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
I stood and watched in silence  
As others were brought in  
I saw them start to tremble  
When they turned and faced their sin  
They offered no excuses  
They offered no alibis  
The truth was overwhelming  
And it would not be denied  
Their righteousness like filthy rags  
And nothing they could say  
They bowed their heads in silence  
As they were led away  
But for the true believers  
Each time it was the same  
His glory shown around them  
As they called upon his name  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered their transgressions  
And all the times they failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
No greater sacrifice has any other made  
Oh yes he paid the price  
With every drop he gave  
Chorus (repeat 2X)
