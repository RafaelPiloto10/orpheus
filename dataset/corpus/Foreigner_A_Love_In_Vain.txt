Long night, too long and lonely  
Laying there asking myself  
Hey, what's going on with you and me  
How could I be so unaware  
So blind I could not see  
Knowing you'd be there  
And always would be  
  
Is anyone to blame but me  
I've been so concerned with myself  
Now I need you desperately  
If you've fallen for another  
Let's be honest with each other  
Is there still a chance  
And maybe hope to save our romance  
  
We can't be strangers  
You mean too much to me  
I won't let this be a love in vain  
Don't want the loneliness  
Of just a memory  
I don't want a love in vain  
  
Just one more night, I want to spend with you  
We'll let our hearts do the talking  
Like we used to do  
We'll make our first kiss last forever  
Put the pieces back together  
'Cause there's still a chance  
There may be hope to save our romance  
  
We can't be strangers  
You mean to much to me  
I won't let this be a love in vain, don't want a love in vain  
I don't want the loneliness  
Of just a memory  
Don't want a love in vain  
  
Oh, woman look what you've done to me  
I'll show you how this love should be  
Don't let it be a love in vain  
Please don't, don't you know  
You got my heart on a string  
Don't let go  
Don't let this love be a love in vain  
  
We can't be strangers  
It's not our destiny  
I won't let this be a love in vain, don't want a love in vain  
Don't want the loneliness  
Of just a memory  
Don't let this be a love in vain
