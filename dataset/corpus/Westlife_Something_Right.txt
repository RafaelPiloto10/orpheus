Never thought that I'd so inspired  
Never thought that I'd find the higher truth  
I believed that love was overrated  
'Till the moment I found you  
  
Now baby I know I don't deserve  
The love you give me  
But now I understand that  
  
[Chorus]  
If you want me I must be doing something right  
I got nothing left to prove  
And it's all because of you  
So if you need me  
And baby I make you feel alive  
I know I must be doing  
Doing something right  
  
It's because of you I feel so lifted  
I've been looking at my life from higher ground  
Never thought I'd be so elated  
You're the one that turned it all around  
  
Now baby, I didn't know myself  
Until you changed me  
And made me understand that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And baby I know I don't deserve the love you give me  
But I don't really care, cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Doing something right  
Yeah yeah  
Something right  
  
So if you need me  
And baby I make you feel alive  
I know I must be doing (I know I must be doing)  
Must be doing something right  
Yeah yeah  
Something right
