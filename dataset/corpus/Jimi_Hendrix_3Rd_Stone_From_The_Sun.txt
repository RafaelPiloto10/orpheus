Positive. it is know to have some form of intelligent species. over'  
'I think we should take a look.'  
Strange beautiful grass of green  
With your majestic silken seas  
Your mysterious mountains  
I wish to see closer  
May I land my kinky machine  
Although your world wonders me  
With you majestic superior cackling hen  
Your people I do not understand  
So to you I wish to put and end  
And you'll never hear surf music again
