Thirteen have come and gone  
Crimson death, crimson blood  
Rise from Hell, it's fire burns everywhere  
  
Thirteen, the spell's begun  
Summon up the devil's son  
A monster born within everyone  
  
I know it must be stopped  
It's kill or be killed  
Hell Night  
  
The thirteen we must find  
Burning give us little time  
Kill them fast and get away  
  
The thirteen have been slain  
And are laid in shallow graves  
We must destroy everything at the scene  
  
And I know it must be killed  
It's kill or be killed  
Hell Night
