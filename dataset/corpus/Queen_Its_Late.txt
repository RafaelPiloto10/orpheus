You say you love me  
And I hardly know your name  
And if I say I love you in the candle light  
There's no-one but myself to blame  
But there's something inside  
That's turning my mind away  
Woh - how I could love you  
If I could let you stay  
  
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside  
It's late - ooh, is it just my sickly pride?  
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away  
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say  
It's late - It's late - It's late  
But not too late  
  
Mmm, yeah  
The way you love me  
Is the sweetest love around  
But after all this time  
The more I'm trying  
The more I seem to let you down, yes  
Now you tell me you're leaving  
And I just can't believe it's true  
Oh, you know that I can love you  
Though I know I can't be true  
Oh, you made me love you  
Don't tell me that we're through  
  
It's late - mmm, and it's driving me so mad  
It's late - yes I know, but don't try and tell me that it's  
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the light  
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right  
It's late - It's late - It's late  
But not too late  
  
Mm, I've been so long  
You've been so long  
We've been so long tryin' to work it out  
I ain't got long  
You ain't got long  
We've gotta know what this life's all about, ooh  
Tell me  
Tryin' to work it out, yeah, ooh  
Ooh too late, yeah, too late, much too late, aaah  
  
You're staring at me  
With suspicion in your eye  
You say what game are you playing?  
What's this that you're saying?  
I know that I can't reply  
If I take you tonight  
Is it making my life a lie?  
Oh you make me wonder  
Did I live my life right?  
  
It's late - ooh, but it's time to set me free  
It's late - ooh, yes I know, but there's no way it has to be  
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night  
So late - let the waters take our guilt in the tide  
It's late - It's late - It's late - It's late  
It's late - It's late - It's late  
Oh, It's all too late  
  
Woah, woah, c'mon  
Ooh m m m m late too late oh yeah  
Waaa
