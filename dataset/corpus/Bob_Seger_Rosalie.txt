She's quite the mediator  
A smoother operator you will never see  
She'll see you later  
And no one dares disobey her openly  
  
She knows music, I know music too you see  
She's got the power, the teen queen Rosalie  
  
Rosalie, Rosalie  
She's got the plastic  
Comes from all the corner's corners of the world  
So fantastic  
She's everybody's favorite little record girl  
  
She knows music, I know music too you see  
She's got the power, she's got the tower  
Rosalie, Rosalie  
  
From Chattanooga, to good old Bogalusa  
You can hear them fine  
She makes her choices  
And then you best be smilin' when it's choosin' time  
  
Knows music  
No music till you see  
She's got the power, got the tower, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie  
Knows music, knows music, knows music  
Rosalie, Rosalie
