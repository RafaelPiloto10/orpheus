[chorus]  
Oh damn  
The club 'bout to close in a minute  
Can I get your number, baby  
So you and I can go get in it  
Let me come and pick you up, oh  
And go take you out, oh  
Can I get your number, baby  
So I can show you what I'm all about  
What I'm all about, damn  
  
I've been checkin' you out  
And I noticed that you ain't just one of the crowd  
So tell me won't you  
Come on and see about me, baby  
I've got the Cris on ice and I'm 'bout to get nice  
Up in VIP with all my ladies  
Tell me how many times in your life  
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight  
Tell me a little somethin' about you  
Here's a little somethin' about me  
I got a house in Capri and my own G4  
And that Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you're sitting next to me  
I bet you're wondering  
What my intentions are for you  
And I to get into  
Baby, I just want to  
Hug and kiss and love ya  
Look into my eyes, baby, don't be shy  
Is it yes or no  
We ain't got all night  
Tell me how many times in your life  
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight  
Tell me a little somethin' bout you  
Here's a little somethin' bout me  
I got a pimp penthouse with a sick hot tub  
We can watch the flat screen  
While the bubbles fill it up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la
