Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us  
  
Although them again we will never never never trust  
  
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!  
  
Them not know what them do  
Big out to yi while I'm stickin' like glue  
Fling skin grin while them plotting for you true!  
  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Me nah tellin' them no more)  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Be real, them not a clue!)  
Beware the false motives of others  
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers  
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you  
To you  
They say all the right things, to gain their position  
Then use your kindness as their ammunition  
to shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do  
Oh  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
  
Why every Indian want to be the chief?  
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef  
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece  
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?  
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?  
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets  
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek  
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik  
and other African czars, observing stars with war scars  
Get yours in this capitalistic system  
So many caught or got bought you can't list them  
How you gonna idolize the missing?  
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition  
even when they comin', gunnin' I stand position  
L's known the mission since conception  
Let's free the people from deception  
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions  
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto  
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto  
Why black people always be the ones to settle?  
March through these streets like Soweto, uh  
  
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus  
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
It took me a little while to discover  
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers  
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves  
A friend once said, and I found to be true  
that everyday people, they lie to God too  
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Forgive dem, forgive dem)  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
(Forgive dem, forgive dem)  
  
Gwan like dem love while dem rip you to shreds  
Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead  
Dem a-yuh friend who yuh depen pon from way back when  
but if you, gi dem yuh back dem yuh mus meet yuh end  
Dem not know what dem do do  
Dem not know what dem do do  
Dem not know, dem not know, dem not know, dem not know  
Dem not know what dem do do  
(Forgive them father, forgive them father)
