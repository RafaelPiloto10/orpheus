She gets the sun in the daytime  
Perfume in the dusk  
And she comes out in the night time  
With the honeysuckle musk  
Because she smells just like a rose  
And she tastes just like a peach  
She got me walking where the wildlife goes  
I'd do anything to reach her  
  
And she was made in heaven  
Heaven's in the world  
Is this just expresso love  
You know I'm crazy for the girl  
  
She call me just to talk  
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine  
She says hey mister you wanna take a walk  
In the wild west end sometime  
And I get trouble with my breathing  
She says boys don't know anything  
But I know what I want  
I want everything  
  
Well I feel so good 'cause I feel so good  
And I feel so good 'cause it feels so right  
I was made to go with my girl  
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night  
  
And she can raise one eyebrow  
Put her hand on my hip  
And I close one eye now  
Sweat on her tip  
And I surrender to the fever  
She love me so tender I got to believe her  
Love? expresso love's alright  
  
I don't want no sugar in it  
Thank you very much  
All wired up on it all fired up on it  
Expresso touch  
Hey maestro expresso  
It's just another one just like the other one  
Hey maestro expresso  
Is this another one just like the other one
