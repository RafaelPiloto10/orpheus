Oh city shine on tomorrow  
For today I feel rain  
There is a decent moon  
Now I lay me down in the light  
  
My man's afraid, no communication  
I'm sure life in my arms ain't been free  
Is it a sacrifice to love me now  
Are you alright?  
  
Will you take my hand so I'm not alone  
You're the road I need to lead me home baby...forever  
Will you be my friend, will you walk with me  
Can we wash away the history that clouds our love  
What came before surely won't be  
There's a clean rain fallin' over me  
  
I know I cried after what you told me  
You said you're not sure where this love is going  
Why would you hesitate if you really love me now  
Are you alright?  
  
Will you take my hand, you're the road I need to lead me home...forever  
Will you be my friend, will you walk with me  
Can we wash away the history that clouds our love  
What came before surely won't be  
  
Hey we've been running too long, let's settle down  
Gotta keep our head above water  
Take a look around  
How long will you wait for me  
How long will you wait for me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)
