Singled out the kids who are mean to me  
Get straight A's but they still make fun  
I don't give a, I'll laugh last  
Stayed in every night  
  
Do my homework so I'll be smart  
Girls all say I'm a little fucked  
Mommy I'm a good boy  
Mommy I'm a fuckin' savior  
Mommy I'm alive  
  
Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight  
  
Rip the veins from human necks  
Until they're wet with life  
Razor-blades love teenage flesh  
An epidermoty  
I'll bring back a souvenir  
For it's my mommy's dream  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
Killed a girl on lovers' lane  
I kept her toes and teeth  
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep  
I'll bring back a souvenir  
For it's my mommy's dream  
  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
  
Killed a girl on lover's lane  
I kept her toes and teeth  
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep  
I'll bring back a souvenir  
For it's my mommy's dream  
  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
Kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight  
  
Kill tonight, kill tonight  
Kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
Mommykill tonight, kill tonight
