Atlanta, Georgia made her the Cotton Queen  
L.A. bound she had visions of the silver screen  
But Hollywood ain't nothin' but glamor and lights  
To a blue-eyed blond with stars in her eyes  
Her days are long. Lord, her nights are longer yet  
Tryin' to find a part that will make her the Queen of sex  
She's realizing what it's all about from too many nights upon the casting
couch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hollywood: parties and thrills  
The mansion in her mind is somewhere is Beverly Hills  
She's been discovered too many times standing on the corner of Hollywood and
Vine  
  
She makes her entrance now a days through the swingin' doors  
She found her stage on a hardwood barroom floor  
But it's not the bottom, just part of a long, hard fall  
Her biggest fan's the man. Tonight she'll give her all  
The dream is dyin' of her name on the marquee  
The folks back home wonder what happened to their Queen  
The mornin' papers told it in black and white, calling it another Hollywood
suicide  
  
[Chorus:]
