Well the times are gettin' hard for you little girl  
I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world  
You can't remember when you had your last meal  
And you don't know just how a woman feels  
  
You didn't know what rock and roll was  
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus  
I got there in the nick of time  
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah  
  
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road  
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold  
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda beat  
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet  
  
You didn't know how rock and roll looked  
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group  
Halfway home in the parking lot  
By the look in her eye she was givin' what she got  
  
I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby  
  
Oh, woman you're a mess, gonna die in your sleep  
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat  
Can't keep you home, you're messin' around  
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town  
  
You didn't know that rock and roll burned  
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned  
You got the rhythm, you got the speed  
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet  
  
I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby  
  
Alright! I didn't know you had a rock and roll record  
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket  
You told me I was the only one  
But look at you now, it's as dark as it's gone  
  
I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby  
I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe  
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
