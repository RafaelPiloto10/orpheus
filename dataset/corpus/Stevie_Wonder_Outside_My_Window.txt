Much has been written about  
The world and all its kind of loves  
But the sweetest of them all  
You seldom will find stories of, oh, oh, oh, oh  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning  
Says, she'll never leave me and I know it's so  
La la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
You don't have to look around  
Or ask yourself if she is there  
'Cause the fragrance of her love  
Says, 'Hi' with every breath of air, oh, oh, oh, oh  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning  
Says, she'll never leave me and I know it's so  
La la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
You will often hear her name  
Describing anothers prettiness  
But if ever there was choice  
My flower would be the prettiest, oh, oh, oh, oh  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning  
Says, she'll never leave me and I know it's so  
My love lives outside my window  
Clouds burst to give water  
So her love can grow, oh  
My love smiles to me each morning  
Says, she'll never leave me and I know it's so  
La la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la

La la la la la la
