Your sad eyes never told me  
No paradise here for the lonely  
But I hold on, half a heart here in my hands  
Been so long, would you know me  
Whose holding you, whose gonna hold me  
If you want me, then I'll be your man  
  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you come back to me  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you run to me  
Can you take me to heaven  
Show me the way cause I'm no angel  
I am lost and  
Can I hold you one more time  
I guess me holding you was holding you down  
  
Will I have your memory  
Or will your memory have me  
I don't know, only time  
Knows if I'll ever know peace of mind  
Only time knows if you're mine, if you're mine  
  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you come back to me  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you run to me  
All I can hold is a shadow of a heart that's gone  
And left me shattered  
I'm lost and  
Can I hold you one more time  
I guess me holding you. was holding you down [Repeat: x2]
