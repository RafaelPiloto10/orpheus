She was morning, and I was night time  
I one day woke up  
To find her lying beside my bed  
I softly said "Come take me"  
For I've been lonely in need of someone  
As though I'd done someone wrong somewhere  
But I don't know where, I don't know where  
Come lately  
  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me  
  
Song she sang to me  
Song she brang to me  
Words that rang in me,  
Rhyme that sprang from me  
Warmed the night, and what was right  
Became me  
  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me  
  
And so it was that I came to travel  
Upon a road that was thorned and narrow  
Another place, another grace  
Would save me  
  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me...
