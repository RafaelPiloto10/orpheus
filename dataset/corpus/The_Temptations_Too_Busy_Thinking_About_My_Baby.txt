I ain't got time to think about money,  
Or what it can buy (ah ah ah ah)  
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder,  
At what makes a birdie fly (ah ah ah ah)  
I don't have time to think about what  
Makes a flower grow  
And I never given a thought  
To where rivers flow  
(Too busy thinking about my baby)  
  
Oh yeah,  
Ain't got time for nothing else  
I ain't got time to discuss the weather,  
Or how long its gonna last (ah ah ah ah)  
And I ain't got time to do no studying,  
Once I get out of class (ah ah ah ah)  
And I'm just a fella,  
With a one, a one track mind  
And when it comes to thinking about,  
Anything but my baby,  
I just don't have time!  
(Too busy thinking about my baby)  
  
Oh yeah,  
Ain't got time for nothing else  
And I know it's all, it's alright  
  
I ain't got time to read a newspaper,  
Or look at TV (ah ah ah ah)  
'Cause I'm not concerned with what the future holds,  
In store for me (ah ah ah ah)  
I'm just a fella,  
With a one, a one track mind  
And when it comes to thinking about,  
Anything but my baby,  
I just don't have time!  
(Too busy thinking about my baby)  
  
Oh yeah,  
Ain't got time for nothing else  
You know I'm too, too busy  
(Too busy thinking about my baby)  
  
Oh yeah,  
Ain't got time for nothing else
