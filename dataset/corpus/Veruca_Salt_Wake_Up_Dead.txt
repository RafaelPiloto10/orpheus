Wake up dead  
You're entitled to  
A night or two in bed  
Without disguises  
Wake up dead  
You've decided to  
Spend eternity without surprises  
Wake up dead  
You're excited to  
Wake up dead  
But I will accept you  
Til the sun falls down  
And I will protect you  
Til the sun falls down  
Wake up dead  
You're invited to  
Take a midnight stroll  
With Mephistopheles  
Wake up dead  
You're awake enough  
To know just what it takes  
To get away from me  
Wake up dead  
You're excited to  
Wake up dead  
But I will accept you  
Til the sun falls down  
And I will protect you  
Til the sun falls down  
And I will respect you  
Til the sun falls down
