You say she's been mad at you  
Then you say you'll be patient, ooh  
Still I see that she makes you blue  
Come on, I'll give you consolation  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
  
Just to be where you want to be  
So much fun we could have then, hmm  
To be close for eternity  
What a miracle to happen  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
'Cause you don't please her like you please me  
  
You're my life, you're my angel  
You're my first, you're my last  
Would she care if you lingered  
For another night  
Want to hold you tight  
We could make it right  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
And I would love to sing my love song  
For you
