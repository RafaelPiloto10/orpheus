Verse 1  
Is it okay, to show my face? I'm wondering if I  
Can talk to you, you're being rude, and there's no need to cry you departed
me, pardon me, you left me, I'm sorry  
For whatever that I did to you  
From party to party and shots of Bacardi  
Girl it's clear to see I,  
Chorus:  
Don't spend enough time with you(that's why)  
You don't spend enough time with me(that's right)  
I just wanna make it up to you(but how)  
I'm just gonna do it do it somehow  
Give me a second chance, girl a second chance  
Give me a second chance. Ima be a better man  
And I promise girl, I will do what I can  
To let you know that I am a changed man  
Verse 2  
You tell your friends, that you don't know, what ima do next  
You're scared of me, no need to be, it's not like I'm your ex  
Standing here, close to tears, christmas cheers, happy new years  
Neither can replace the fact that you're gone  
Truth is so visible it's almost crystal clear  
Girl it's plain to see I,  
Chorus...  
Bridge:  
Changed man, changed man, give me a second chance  
Give me a second chance ima be a changed man  
Second chance, second chance ima be a changed man  
Ima be a changed man give me a second chance  
Second chance, whoa, ooh a second chance  
I, ima be a changed man  
Girl it's plain to see I,  
Don't spend enough time with you(that's why)  
You don't spend enough time with me(that's right)  
I just wanna make it up to you(but how)  
I'm just gonna do it do it somehow!  
Give me a second chance, girl a second chance(give)  
Me a second chance ima be a better man  
And I promise girl, I will do what I can  
To let you know that I am a changed man
