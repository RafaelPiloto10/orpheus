I wish I could turn back time  
I wish I'd never have to see that look in your eyes  
You really broke this heart of mine  
Now it's time to realize it's forever goodbye  
  
So here I am  
All alone  
Don't understand where did we go wrong  
I can't stop crying  
Can't take the pain  
Knowing you won't ever be back again  
  
And it cuts like a knife  
I'm going insane  
Wishing you would show me love  
Once again  
I'm losing my mind  
But I have to carry on  
We were meant to be together  
Forever as one  
  
So this is where the story ends  
Gonna take some to dry the tears in my eyes  
You told me we could still be friends  
Now I know your promises were nothing but lies  
  
So here I am  
All alone  
Don't understand where did we go wrong  
I can't stop crying  
Can't take the pain  
Knowing you won't ever be back again  
  
And it cuts like a knife  
I'm going insane  
Wishing you would show me love  
Once again  
I'm losing my mind  
But I have to carry on  
We were meant to be together  
Forever as one
