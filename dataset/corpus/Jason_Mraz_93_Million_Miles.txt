93 million miles from the sun  
People get ready, get ready  
'Cause here it comes, it's a light  
A beautiful light, over the horizon  
Into our eyes  
Oh, my my how beautiful  
Oh my beautiful mother  
She told me, son in life you're gonna go far  
If you do it right, you'll love where you are  
Just know, wherever you go  
You can always come home  
  
240 thousand miles from the moon  
We've come a long way to belong here  
To share this view of the night  
A glorious night  
Over the horizon is another bright sky  
Oh my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father  
He told me, son sometimes it may seem dark  
But the absence of the light is a necessary part  
Just know, you're never alone, you can always come back home  
  
Oh, oh  
  
You can always come back  
  
Every road is a slippery slope  
But there is always a hand that you can hold on to  
Looking deeper through the telescope  
You can see that your home's inside of you  
  
Just know, that wherever you go  
No you're never alone  
You will always get back home  
  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh  
  
93 million miles from the sun  
People get ready, get ready  
'Cause here it comes, it's a light  
A beautiful light, over the horizon  
Into our eyes
