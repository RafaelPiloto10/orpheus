Yeah!  
  
I'm from South Philadelphia up on Avenue C  
I've seen empty hands that was waitin' to freeze  
Up from the power at home  
  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
  
I've seen Hollywood Boulevard  
Welfare hotel  
And I spent the night in jail  
At the Wilcox Hotel  
  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
I don't care about you  
  
I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan  
Well he died while we just stood there lookin' at him  
Ain't he cute?  
  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
I don't care about you  
  
I seen mad rollin' drunks  
I seen bodies in the streets  
I saw a man who was sleepin' in his own puke  
And a man with no legs crawlin' down  
Fifth Street tryin' just to get somethin' to eat  
  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
I don't care about you  
Fuck you!  
I don't care about you  
  
Fuck you!  
  
(spoken)  
Uh, that hurt man  
Alright  
Perfect
