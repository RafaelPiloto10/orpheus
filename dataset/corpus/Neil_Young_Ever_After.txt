When you hear that rooster crowing  
In the dawn, in the dawn  
There's really no way of knowing  
What goes on, what goes on  
  
The world is full of questions  
Some are answered, some are not  
The only faith you're keepin'  
Is the faith that you still got  
  
I love the sound of laughter  
And music in the air  
And in the ever after  
I know it's always there  
  
A man had many boxes  
And he liked them quite a lot  
But they would not be opened  
Cause the value would be shot  
  
Sometimes when I go walkin'  
In the trees, in the trees  
That's where I do my prayin'  
In the trees, in the trees  
  
The world is full of answers  
Some are right, some are wrong  
The one that I believe in is a wish in a song  
  
I love to see you smilin'  
And hear your voice so fair  
And in the ever after  
I know you're always there
