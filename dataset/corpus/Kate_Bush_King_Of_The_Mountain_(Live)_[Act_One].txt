[Verse 1]  
Could you see the aisles of women?  
Could you see them screaming and weeping?  
Could you see the storm rising?  
Could you see the guy who was driving?  
Could you climb higher and higher?  
Could you climb right over the top?  
Why does a multi-millionaire  
Fill up his home with priceless junk?  
  
[Refrain]  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
[Chorus]  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain  
  
[Verse 2]  
Another Hollywood waitress  
Is telling us she's having your baby  
And there's a rumour that you're on ice  
And you will rise again someday  
And that there's a photograph  
Where you're dancing on your grave  
  
[Refrain]  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
[Chorus]  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain  
  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain now  
  
[Vocalisations]  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  
Ooooooh!  
  
[Bridge 1: Kate Bush, Chorus]  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows the door closed  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
  
[Instrumental Interlude]  
  
[Bridge 2]  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
A-ha! A-ha!  
Oh, there's a storm rising  
  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
A-ha! A-ha!  
Oh, there's a storm rising  
  
Can't you see it?  
Can't you see it?  
There's a storm rising!  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, the wind it blows  
Oh, the wind it blows  
A-ha! A-ha!  
Oh, there's a storm rising  
Yes, there's a storm rising  
  
Can't you feel it?  
Can't you feel it rising?  
  
Oh, the wind  
Oh, the wind it blows
