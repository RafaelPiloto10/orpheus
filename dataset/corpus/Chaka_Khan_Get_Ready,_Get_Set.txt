Night's gonna fall  
Letting the stars shine through and through  
Time on the wall  
Bringing me closer to the  
One i want  
I can't wait no more, no, no  
  
Lost like a child  
Even my knees are shaking  
Caught for a while  
Under a wave that's breaking  
Over me  
In his arms i float  
  
When he looks at me this way  
I know what he'll say  
  
Chorus:  
Get ready, get set  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
All day, all night  
Here's something you can't forget  
Get ready, get set  
You ain't seen nothing yet  
All day, all night  
Here's something you can't forget  
  
I could try  
Imagining something better than  
You and i  
Making sweet love together  
Taking me much farther than before  
When he looks at me this way  
I know just what he'll say  
  
Ooh ooh  
When he looks at me this way  
I know just what he'll say  
  
Na na na na  
Na na na na
