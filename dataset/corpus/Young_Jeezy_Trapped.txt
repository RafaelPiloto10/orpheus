Yo, they still be grindin', and runnin'  
Tryin' to get into somethin' or nothin'  
I remember them days, when the block got hot, bullets flyin' for the what  
It was, like, you ain't, really give a fuck  
I'm a sister, mother, I'm your daughter, I'm your lover and I'm  
Right here, and I'm sayin' that it's whack sauce  
Everything that you do tryna be the boss  
You ain't really really doin' it, (nah)  
I mean honestly pursuing it  
Ca-cause, if you did you wouldn't be murdering, (your own people like)  
Oh ya see, it's a trap, (it's a trap, that's what it's called by the way)  
It's a trap  
  
It's a trap night nigga, here we go again  
Jill left the door wide open, so I'm goin' in, (let's go)  
Through a bedroom I could see my momma tears, (tears)  
All I smell is Hennessey mixed with my momma fears, (yeah)  
Please momma don't cry, you know I hate cryin', (cryin')  
I try my best not to die, you know I hate dyin', (yeah)  
Three eighty for my thirteenth birthday, (birthday)  
I promised her I wouldn't let you motherfuckers hurt me, (yeah)  
So y'all get back, Jeezy got a automatic  
Every time I turn the TV on a nigga seein' static, (damn)  
Guess they forgot to pay them cable folks  
Them niggas in my first class got them cable jokes, (haha)  
Open up the refrigerator see some old milk  
Shit been sittin' so long look like some old silk, (damn)  
I've been cursed since the day this earth birthed me  
I've been cursed since the day my mother birthed me, (yeah)  
And how did I get here in the first place  
Oh that's right, see the trap was my birthplace (haha, young)  
  
[Chorus]  
Said that I know you've been trapped, (trapped)  
Like you wanna move on, but they hold you back  
To face consequences, of what you did on some bullshit (yeah, wassup)  
Said that I know you've been trapped, (trapped)  
Like you wanna move on, but they hold you back, (ain't no way out)  
To face consequences, of what you did on some bullshit (what you know bout
this homie, trap life, let's go)  
  
Even though we had a will, we ain't have a way, (way)  
They just told us how to live, we ain't have a say, (say)  
All I know is the other side got some cuffs for ya, (for ya)  
Fresh khaki suit, nigga that's enough for ya, (yeah)  
Got ya spendin' all ya money on lawyer fees, (fees)  
Judge throwin' numbers at you like he speakin' Japanese, (oo-wahh)  
All cause a nigga out here playin' bakery, (bakery)  
I'm out here tryna get this bread, somebody pray for me, (haha)  
I'm always on the block so I rarely go to church, (church)  
Didn't wanna hear it from the preacher, cause the truth hurts  
And right now I'm so high, I should be scared of heights, (heights)  
A Town nigga I be on that kryptonite, (yeah)  
I got deadlines nigga no bedtime, (time)  
The only thing promised to ya is some fed time, (time)  
And how did I get here in the first place  
Oh that's right, see the trap was my birthplace (haha, Young)  
  
You ain't really really doin' it, (nah)  
I mean honestly pursuin' it, (not at all)  
Ca-cause, if you did you wouldn't be murdering, (your people like)  
Oh ya see, it's a trap, (it's a trap ya'll)  
It's a trap (this the trap life, welcome to it, yeah, let's go)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trap or cry nigga till the day I mothafuckin' die nigga  
Till you put me in that mothafuckin' couch and you put that dirt on me homie  
Goin, ain't no way out  
It's death or jail nigga  
I'm there  
Count me in  
Trap life
