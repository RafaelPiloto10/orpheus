No wind when I took the watch  
My ship was still and waitin'  
I lay on that mirrored sky  
A restless sail or waitin'  
I closed my eyes said the  
Words of will for the gentle  
Breathin' that moves the seas  
Make my sails fill  
  
Whisper waves cloud the glass  
Awake at last like a lover  
It rushed around the talkin' sweet  
Roll over, roll over, roll over  
And in my ear he blew his name  
It sound so strange but I heard it plain  
Mistral Mistral wind  
  
I have always held the wheel but  
I let the wind steal my power  
Spin me 'round lose my course  
Nights run be like hours  
Well, it would show me the way  
To the deepest mountains  
Too high and beautiful to be  
Mistral, mistral wind  
  
All the hours on the watch  
I wait for that breeze to move me  
And blow me back to that place  
Magic space all through me  
And I sigh your name  
Across the empty water  
You made a crazy dreamer out of me  
Mistral, mistral, mistral, mistral,  
Mistral, mistral
