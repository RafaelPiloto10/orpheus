[Hook:]  
That's not love  
That's not love  
That's not love  
  
[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]  
Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement  
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen  
And dead animals and dead men  
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen  
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die  
The answer's right under your nose  
Exposed to the street, in the game I don't cheat  
I just play my position, get mvp  
I get money, don't shit come free  
It's my life and I run it even when  
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach  
And I never show my hand, not even to me  
See...  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 2]  
Say what's on your heart if you're real  
Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal  
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought  
Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught  
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot  
You empty clip niggas aint got a shot  
  
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore  
Now you decide if their to die for  
Advice to my haters, do what I say now  
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down  
Thought it was love, how foolish of us  
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]  
Look, as the crooked World revolves  
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)  
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live  
And when death comes you better have lives to give  
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs  
And rats die ugly, die with kids  
These niggas is snitching and still living  
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches  
Niggas pretend like they actually in  
But when it go down they f-ck around and be them  
That blood look familiar when it's leaking  
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga  
That aint love  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 4]  
Life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous  
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist  
Just anothger page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me
