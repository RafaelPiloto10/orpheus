Daddy's baby, what's got you thinking?  
What's got you sinking so low?  
Is there something I should know,  
Something new to you?  
Daddy's baby fussing and fretting,  
Keeping on getting it wrong.  
  
She can only last so long  
So sing her a lullaby-bye  
Baby don't like to cry,  
So sing her a lullaby-bye  
Swaddle and swing her,  
Sing her a lullaby.  
  
She makes her feelings known to me,  
Her every side is shown to me  
And in our time alone,  
Our love has surely grown of its own  
Silent as a stepping stone,  
Silently as the dawn was breaking,  
Soft and clear and my tears were dry,  
And my tears had flown  
So I called my love my home.
