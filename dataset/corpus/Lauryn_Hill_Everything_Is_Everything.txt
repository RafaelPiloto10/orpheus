Everything is everything  
What is meant to be, will be  
After winter, must come spring  
Change, it comes eventually  
  
Everything is everything  
What is meant to be, will be  
After winter, must come spring  
Change, it comes eventually  
  
I wrote these words for everyone who struggles in their youth  
Who won't accept deception, instead of what is truth  
It seems we lose the game  
Before we even start to play  
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)  
We're so confused (We're so confused)  
Easily led astray  
Let me tell ya that  
  
Everything is everything  
Everything is everything  
After winter, must come spring  
Everything is everything  
  
I philosophy  
Possibly speak tongues  
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist  
Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning  
My practice extending across the atlas  
I begat this  
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress  
You can't match this rapper slash actress  
More powerful than two Cleopatras  
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti  
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti  
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (Betty Shabazz!)  
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations  
Then came down for a little conversation  
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being  
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum  
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture  
Develop a negative into a positive picture  
  
Now everything is everything  
What is meant to be, will be  
After winter, must come spring  
Change, it comes eventually  
  
Sometimes it seems  
We'll touch that dream  
But things come slow or not at all  
And the ones on top, won't make it stop  
So convinced that they might fall  
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail  
To make a better situation  
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow  
All we need is dedication  
Let me tell ya that  
  
Everything is everything  
Everything is everything  
After winter, must come spring  
Everything is everything  
  
Everything is everything  
What is meant to be, will be  
After winter, must come spring  
Change, it comes eventually
