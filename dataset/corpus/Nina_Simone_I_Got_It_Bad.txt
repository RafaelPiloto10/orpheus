My baby never treats me  
Sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
No, that ain't good  
My poor heart is sentimental  
Not made of wood  
'Cause I've got it bad and that ain't good  
And when the weekend's over  
And Monday rolls around  
I end up like I start out  
Just cryin' my heart out  
Lord above me  
Make him love me  
The way he should  
The way he should  
Because I've got it so bad and that ain't good  
I got it bad and that ain't good
