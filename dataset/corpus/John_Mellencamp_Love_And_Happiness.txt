Well we're dropping our bombs  
In the southern hemisphere  
And people are starving  
That live right here  
And they're tearing down walls  
In the name of peace  
And they're killing each other  
In the middle east  
  
But love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness  
  
They raise the price of oil  
And they censor our mouths  
If you are a young couple today  
Forget buying a house  
And we wage our wars  
In the neighborhoods  
We kill the young to feed the old  
And men that ain't no good  
  
Yeah, but love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness  
  
So if you sell arms  
Or if you run dope  
You got respect  
And you got hope  
But the rest of us die  
On your battle fields  
With wounds that fester and bleed  
But never heal  
  
Yeah love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness  
  
And love and happiness  
Yeah love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness
