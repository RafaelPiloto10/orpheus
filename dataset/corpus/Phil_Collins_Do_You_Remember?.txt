We never talked about it  
But I hear the blame was mine  
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry  
But I wouldn't want to waste your time  
  
Cause I love you, but I can't take any more  
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes  
If we could try, like we tried before  
Would you keep on telling me those lies  
  
Do you remember?  
  
There seemed no way to make up  
Cause it seemed your mind was set  
And the way you looked it told me  
It's a look I know I'll never forget  
  
You could've come over to my side  
You could've let me know  
You could've tried to see the difference between us  
But it seemed too far for you to go.  
  
Do you remember?  
  
Through all of my life  
In spite of all the pain  
You know people are funny sometimes  
Cause they just can't wait  
To get hurt again  
  
Do you remember?  
  
There are things we won't recall  
Feelings we'll never find  
It's taken so long to see it  
Cause we never seemed to have the time  
  
There was always something more important to do  
More important to say  
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things  
And now it's too late  
  
Do you remember?
