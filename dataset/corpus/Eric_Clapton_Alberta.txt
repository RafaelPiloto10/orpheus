Alberta, Alberta,  
Where you been so long?  
Alberta, Alberta,  
Where you been so long?  
Ain't had no loving  
Since you've been gone.  
  
Alberta, Alberta,  
Where'd you stay last night?  
Alberta, Alberta  
Where'd you stay last night?  
Come home this morning,  
Clothes don't fit you right  
  
Alberta, Alberta,  
Girl, you're on my mind.  
Alberta, Alberta,  
Girl, you're on my mind.  
Ain't had no loving  
Such a great long time.  
  
Alberta, Alberta,  
Where you been so long?  
Alberta, Alberta,  
Where you been so long?  
Ain't had no loving  
Since you've been gone.
