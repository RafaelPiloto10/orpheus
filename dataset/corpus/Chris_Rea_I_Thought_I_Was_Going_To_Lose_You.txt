I thought that I was going to lose you  
Just for a moment you looked like slipping away  
And my only thought was to come with you  
There was no other reason to stay  
Now I'm sinking in a river of happy returns  
Though I'm tired I can do nothing but sigh  
For the greatest relief I'm so thankful  
As I gaze at your coming-back smile  
  
Lord, I thought I was going to lose you  
Yes, I thought I was going to lose you
