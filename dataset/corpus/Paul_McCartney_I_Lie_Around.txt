I lie around  
All over the place  
  
It seems that I have no choice in the matter  
Roll along wheel of fortune  
As you roll along I stick around  
Furthermore in the country  
I will lay my burden down  
I lie around  
I lie around  
I lie around  
All over the place  
All over the place  
All over the place  
All over the place  
  
Too long have I been the heart of the matter  
All along I was only over tired and overtaken  
Furthermore in the country  
I will lay my burden down  
I lie around  
I lie around  
I lie around  
All over the place  
  
So long, bye bye, it was fun while it mattered  
Roll along wheel of fortune  
As you roll along I stick around  
Furthermore in the country  
I will lay my burden down  
  
Yes, I lie around  
All over the place  
All over the place  
All over the place  
I lie around, around.
