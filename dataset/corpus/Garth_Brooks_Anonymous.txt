I wrote our names a thousand times  
Just to see yours sitting next to mine  
Sent you flowers, cards unsigned anonymous  
  
In days to come like days that passed  
My heart beats for you, always has  
Though you know me only as anonymous  
  
In dreams at night I carry your books for you  
And when I rise a flame for you  
Always too shy to carry the whole thing through  
  
Like the light from that eternal flame  
Burns for one without a name  
My love forever will remain anonymous  
  
Oh you'll always wonder who it was  
Who it was  
It was just anonymous  
  
Well I wrote our names a thousand times  
Just to see yours sitting next to mine  
And I sent you flowers cards unsigned
