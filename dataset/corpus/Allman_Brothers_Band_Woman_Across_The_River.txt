Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything  
Everything that money could buy  
But the man told so many lies  
There's another man over there  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
Word got around that he had jilted her  
Men came running from near and far  
Should've never been so foolish  
Guess I'll never  
But the man that's got her now  
He's a lucky so and so  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
I remember the other day, about a week ago  
She said, "I don't even want to talk to you  
'Cause I don't love you anymore"  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything, tried to keep him satisfied  
But the man told so many lies  
There's another man over there  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine
