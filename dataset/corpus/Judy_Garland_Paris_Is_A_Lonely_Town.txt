The glamour's gone,  
The shades are down,  
And Paris is only a lonely town.  
Lonely  
  
When love's a laugh  
And you're the clown  
Then paris is only another town  
Dreary  
  
For the lovers clown  
This town's a weary merry go round  
And round and round  
The chestnut, the willow, the colors of Utrillo  
  
Turn to grey, grey hues  
The band playing vyse  
Along the Champs Elysees  
Sounds like wake up blues  
  
Paris is a lonely, dreary, oh so lonely town  
Where's that shining flower  
'Neath the Eiffel tower?  
Where's that fairy land of gold?  
  
Isn't it a pity that this magic city  
Turned suddenly cold?  
The chimneys moan  
The river cries  
  
Each glamorous bridge is a bridge of sighs  
River, river, won't you be my lover?  
Don't turn me down  
For Paris is such a lonely, lonely town
