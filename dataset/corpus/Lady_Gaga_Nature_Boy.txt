There was a boy...  
A very strange enchanted boy  
  
They say he wondered very far, very far  
Over land and sea  
  
A little shy and sad of eye  
But very wise was he  
  
And then one day  
One magic day, passed my way  
  
And as we spoke of many things,  
Fools and kings,  
This he said to me  
  
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return"  
  
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return"
