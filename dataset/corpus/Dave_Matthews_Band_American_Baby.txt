If these walls came crumbling down  
And fell so hard to make us lose our faith  
From what's left you'd figure it out  
Still make lemonade taste like a sunny day  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
Nobody?s laughing now  
God?s grace lost and the devil is proud  
But I've been walking for a thousand miles  
One last time I could see you smile  
I, I hold, hold on to you  
You bring me hope I'll see you soon  
And if I don't see you  
Oh, I'm afraid we've lost the way  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
American baby  
I hold on to you  
You lift me up  
And always will  
I see you in light  
Hope I don't get left behind  
I, I hold, hold on to you  
You bring me hope I'll see you soon  
And if I don't see you  
Oh, I'm afraid we've lost the way  
Stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
I hope you stay beautiful baby  
I hope you stay American baby  
American baby  
American baby
