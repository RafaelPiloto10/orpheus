You don?t want me calling you up  
All melancholy sick from love  
You prefer it uncomplicated  
Things are tricky now I bet you hate it  
Your mind?s eye finds the exit sign  
And you?re off in perfect fashion  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
The party?s over, we had our fun  
Flirting with madness a loaded gun  
As much as nothing everything?s changed  
I?m soaking in it, it falls like rain  
You seek the sun to dry off what?s been done  
You?ll heat up every corner of the world  
As you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
Can you keep this pace forever  
I have never seen it done  
Up deep burn all you leave behind you  
You are the surface of my sun  
I measure to what degree  
I can shape up what?s been forged in me  
The cooper penny hissing in the pool  
So much for wishes so much for cooling  
Down this fire impossible desire  
The further you get the more I?m drawn  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can
