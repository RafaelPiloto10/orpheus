[Chorus:]  
Charlie don't surf and we think he should  
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good  
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma  
Charlie's gonna be a napalm star  
  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
Must be something we get from birth  
One truth is we never learn  
Satellites will make space burn  
  
We've been told to keep the strangers out  
We don't like them starting to hang around  
We don't like them all over town  
Across the world we are going to blow them down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The reign of the super powers must be over  
So many armies can't free the earth  
Soon the rock will roll over  
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola  
  
It's a one a way street in a one horse town  
One way people starting to brag around  
You can laugh, put them down  
These one way people gonna blow us down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Charlie don't surf he'll never learn  
Charlie don't surf though he's got a gun  
Charlie don't surf think that he should  
Charlie don't surf we really think he should  
Charlie don't surf  
  
Charlie don't surf and we think he should  
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good  
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma  
Charlie don't surf
