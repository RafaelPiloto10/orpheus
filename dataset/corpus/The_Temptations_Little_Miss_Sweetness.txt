Now, I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things  
Sweet things I adore  
In coffee most take one or two lumps, but I use three or four  
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips  
Sugar ain't sweet no more  
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee I ever made before!  
  
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
If ever a man had a sweet tooth, I have one indeed!  
I order cookies and cakes, malts and shakes from the menus that I read!  
  
But all the cakes, and shakes, and malts I've bought put together  
Don't exceed the sweetness in just one of your kisses  
Baby, you're the one I need!  
  
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
  
Now listen to me, you sweet thing  
Hear what I have to say  
If ever you need somebody, send for me without delay!  
  
But do one thing for me: Don't go out on a rainy day  
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar, you will surely melt away!  
  
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
Trying to tell you you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
The sweetest girl in the world
