Who do you think is comin' to town  
You'll never guess who  
Lovable, hugable Emily Brown  
Miss Brown to you  
What if the rain comes pattering down  
My heaven is blue  
Can it be sending me Emily Brown  
Miss Brown to you  
I know her eyes will thrill ya  
But go slow, oh, oh  
Don't you all get too familiar  
Why do you think she's comin' to town  
Just wait and you'll see  
The lovable little Miss Brown to you  
Is baby to me, yes, yes  
Mark it down
