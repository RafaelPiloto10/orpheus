Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
And when you start to lose the fight  
And nothing else will make it right  
  
Only hearts are meant to break  
And when you make that last mistake  
And everything you tried to say  
But all the words got in the way  
  
Only God can hear you now  
When you make that final vow  
Say the words and say them loud  
Say the words that make you proud  
  
And when you lose someone you depend upon  
Only tears will fall  
And when you need a friend I will send you one  
Only tears are meant to fall  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all
