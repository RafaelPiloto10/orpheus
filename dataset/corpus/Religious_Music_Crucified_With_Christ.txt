Verse 1:  
  
As I look back on what I thought was living  
I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay  
And to think I ignored what really mattered  
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great  
But when I finally reached the point of giving in  
I found the cross was calling even then  
And even though it took dying to survive  
I've never felt so much alive.  
  
Chorus:  
  
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live  
Not I but Christ that lives within me  
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give  
For it's not my strength but His  
There's no greater sacrifice  
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live  
  
Verse 2:  
  
As I hear the Savior call for daily dying  
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary  
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose  
That holds be to the cross yet sets me free  
I will glory in the power of the cross  
The things I thought were gain I count as loss  
And with His suffering I identify  
And by His resurrection power I am alive  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bridge:  
  
And I will offer all I have  
So that His cross is not in vain  
For I found to live is Christ  
And to die is truly gain  
  
[Chorus:]
