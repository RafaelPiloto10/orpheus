It all seemed so long ago  
Young and happy don't you know  
Down by the creek I would show  
Fireflies to that girl  
  
But that was back when he was nice  
Before my warm heart turned to ice  
My sister's wig once had lice  
But that was long ago  
  
The schoolyard's where we were  
The first time I kissed her  
He thought he got some tongue  
But it was only retainer  
  
Eleanore's bra is a trainer  
Well, over there's my family home  
And the woods we used to roam  
The only time I had sex was on the phone  
  
But that was long ago  
I carved our names upon that tree  
I loved him and he loved me  
My darling wife was once a he  
  
But that was long ago  
He'd always whisper in my ear  
But then I started drinkin' beer  
My jewels got licked by six frisky deer  
  
Now he's just a loner and a lier  
And my trailor's caught on fire, fire?
