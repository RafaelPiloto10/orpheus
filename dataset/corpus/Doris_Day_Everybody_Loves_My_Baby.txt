Everybody loves my baby  
But my baby don't love nobody but me  
Nobody but me  
Yes  
Everybody wants my baby  
But my baby don't want nobody but me  
That's plain to see!  
  
I'm his sweet Judy  
And he is my loving man!  
No time to do his duty  
Loves me like no other can!  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
But my baby don't love nobody but me  
Nobody but me  
Everybody wants my baby  
But my baby don't want nobody but me  
That's plain to see!  
  
Now when my baby kisses me  
Upon my rosy cheeks -  
I just let those kisses be  
Don't wash my face for weeks!  
  
Everybody loves my baby...
