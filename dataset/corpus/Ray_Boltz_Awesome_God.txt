Awesome God  
Words and Music by Rich Mullins  
Oh, when He rolls up His sleeves  
He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz,  
Our God is an awesome God.  
There's thunder in His footsteps  
And lightning in His fists.  
Our God is an awesome God.  
And the Lord, He wasn't jokin'  
When He kicked 'em out of Eden,  
It wasn't for no reason  
That He shed His blood,  
His return is very close  
And so you better be believin' that our  
God is an awesome God.  
  
[Chorus]  
Our God is an awesome God,  
He reigns from Heaven above,  
With wisdom, power and love,  
Our God is an awesome God.  
  
And when the sky was starless  
In the void of the night,  
Our God is an awesome God.  
He spoke into the darkness  
And created the light.  
Our God is an awesome God.  
The judgment and wrath  
He poured out on Sodom,  
The mercy and grace  
He gave us at the cross,  
I hope that we have not  
Too quickly forgotten that our  
God is an awesome God.  
  
[Chorus](repeat)  
Our God is an awesome God.  
[Chorus](repeat 2X)
