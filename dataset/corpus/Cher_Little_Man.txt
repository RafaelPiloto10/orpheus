Little man, when you stand by my side  
Then I know I don't have to hide from anyone  
And I pray that we'll stay just that way  
Till the day comes along when we catch the sun.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Little girl you're runnin'  
Come catch my hand I'm near you  
Little girl you're singin'  
Come close to me I hear you  
You're growin' old, my mother's cold  
Now you've learned what it meant to be mature  
There's no such place as make believe  
But when I look at your face,  
I'm not so sure  
  
You and me is what I see  
And that's the way its gonna stay and it will always be  
So little man, please understand  
In this world with all its land  
You're all I see  
  
[Chorus: x2]
