He looked through temples of time  
To see you right where you stand  
He emptied all of himself  
So he could reach out his hand  
To give hope and meaning  
To the wasted away  
And you are one of the ones  
That he was dying to save  
  
[Chorus:]  
He was dying to reach you  
Trying to meet you  
Where you need him most  
You've been living in search of  
The whole truth and real love  
Your whole life through  
You can open your heart  
'Cause he's dying to reach you  
  
He's standing there at the door  
You can hear him call you by name  
He simply waits to forgive  
All of the guilt and the shame  
He gave up his own life  
And he still bears the scars  
He only wants to receive you  
So come as you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, he has waited time and time before  
You must be still and know that he is lord
