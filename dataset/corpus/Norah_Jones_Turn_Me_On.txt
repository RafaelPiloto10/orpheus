Like a flower, waiting to bloom  
Like a lightbulb, in a dark room  
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on  
  
Like the desert waiting for the rain  
Like a school kid waiting for the spring  
I'm just sitting here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on  
  
My poor heart, its been so dark  
Since you've been gone  
After all you're the one who turns me off  
But you're the only one who can turn me back on  
  
My Hi-fi is waiting for a new tune  
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes  
I'm just sitting here waiting for you  
To come on home and turn me on, turn me on
