Love is war  
What are we in it for  
Why do we play the game  
Why are we keeping score  
You and I  
You know we were born to fight  
There's so many times before  
Know I should be sure  
Love is war  
Wash my hands  
Trying to understand  
After all the pain  
We'll take another chance  
I just want to close my eyes  
Forget the reasons why  
Lying here on the floor  
All I want is more  
Love is war  
We hurt the ones we love  
But still don't let them go  
We hold on to the words  
You and I would know  
All these tears are in my eyes  
That's where they'll stay  
It's just easier that way  
Then I turn  
Say that I'm not the one  
I don't feel the sting  
I don't feel anything  
I've gone numb  
From all the damage done  
But I'm lying here on the floor  
So many times before  
Love is war  
Lying here on the floor  
All I want is more  
Love is war
