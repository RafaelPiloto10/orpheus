Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news  
Oh what a christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone (my baby's gone) I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
  
Choirs will be singing silent night  
Those christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for christmas (please come home)  
Please come home for christmas (please come home)  
If not for christmas by new year's night  
  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Just as sure as the stars shine above (yes they do)  
This is christmas, christmas my dear  
The time of year to be with the one that you love  
  
Then won't you tell me, you'll never more roam  
Christmas and new year (christmas and new year's)  
Will find you at home  
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain  
I'll be happy (happy) that it's christmas once again.
