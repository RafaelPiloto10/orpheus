I'll string along, string along  
String along with you, dear  
I'll string along, string along  
String along with you, dear  
  
You may not be an angel  
'Cause angels are so few  
But until the day that one comes along  
I'll string along with you  
  
I'm looking for an angel  
To sing my love song to  
And until the day that one comes along  
I'll sing my song to you  
  
For every little fault that you have  
Say I've got three or four  
The human little faults you do have  
Just make me love you more  
  
You may not be an angel  
But still I'm sure you'll do  
So until the day that one comes along  
I'll string along with you  
  
You may not be an angel  
'Cause angels are so few  
But until the day that one comes along  
I'll string along with you, say  
  
I'm looking for an angel  
To sing my love song to  
And until the day that one comes along  
Yes, I'll string along with you  
  
For every little fault that she has  
Say I've got three or four, maybe more  
The little human faults she does have  
Just make me love you more  
  
You may not be an angel  
But still I'm sure you'll do, oh yeah, yes  
So until the day that one comes along  
Yes, I'll string along with you  
  
Until he finds an angel  
I'll string, string along with you  
String along
