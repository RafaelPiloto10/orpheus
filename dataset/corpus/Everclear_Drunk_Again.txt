Kathy please just go away  
Don't let Hazel see you when you're high  
Just take a walk to your sleazy bar  
Come back after I've come down  
  
Cross the street  
On your knees  
Makes me ashamed  
It's hard to sleep  
I can't shake your pain  
You get high, you'd just throw it away  
  
Hey Kathy please give me a break  
I told you not to come here when you're drunk again  
I'm sober now just 30 days  
All alone and working hard to stay that way  
  
Cross the street  
On your knees  
Makes it hard  
It's hard to see  
I can't shake your pain  
  
You get high, you'd just throw it away  
Kathy please, yeah yeah  
I don't want to see you when you're down  
  
Just leave me be and go away  
You're not going to pull me down  
I won't let you throw it away
