For you  
I would tattoo me  
With lines crossing into a hand  
And a heart that would never bleed  
With the twilight  
And the horse drawn on my arm  
Standing for an addiction  
Pray we go unharmed  
  
Here is my love and anger  
You see now  
These are my gods  
These are my scars  
Here is my love and anger  
Well these arms are burning  
But they're open wide  
  
Some things  
I hold too tightly  
Some things  
I'll never  
I'll never touch  
Oh but I'm wearing down the stones  
In the river  
And you see all my life  
I've painted with anger's brush  
  
Now, now could you  
Lift me through my love and anger  
You see now  
These are your gods  
These are my scars  
Lift me through my love and anger  
Ah and my arms are burning  
But they're open wide  
  
Oh  
You precious kid  
I have a motion  
And it's just for you  
I see a warrior  
Barefoot and dancing  
Oh with tears of pain and beauty  
And all of this is true  
  
For you  
Lift me through my love and anger  
You see now these are my gods  
These are your scars  
Lift me through my love and anger  
Oh and my arms are burning  
And they're open wide  
  
Pointing out the graveyards  
I will be the reaper  
If you will be  
The keeper of my heart  
  
I will be the reaper  
If you will be  
The keeper of my heart  
You are the keeper of this heart  
Of my heart
