We're strong, we're weak, we're tired  
We're straight, we're gay, we're bi  
We're black, we're white - why  
To tell the truth, we lie  
We get so trapped inside our little lives  
They disappear, before our very eyes  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on  
It's time we gave it up tonight  
Live it up tonight  
  
We won, we lost, we tried  
Be a saint, I'm fine 'cause I died  
I'm so sick and tired of crying  
So tonight, it's time, just fly  
So now we got so close  
Caught up in the deal  
  
The only thing we had is real  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on  
It's time we gave it up tonight  
Live it up tonight  
  
So we can keep it, make it real  
Can't you feel  
  
Though it hurts so bad  
To say goodbye  
I know my love for you  
Is still alive  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on  
It's time we gave it up tonight  
Live it up tonight  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on  
It's time we gave it up tonight  
Live it up tonight
