Christmas morning, so much fun.  
Down the stairs the children run.  
Someone has eaten the cookies.  
And look what's left under the tree.  
There's presents for you and for me  
As far as the eye can see.  
What's on the rooftop  
I wonder what there was  
There's reindeer flyin' around the world  
Because Santa's comin'!  
I think we all should pause  
To say that we're grateful  
For everything he does.  
Thank you Santa Claus!  
Thank you Santa Claus!  
Woah...  
So for all the things you do,  
Santa Claus we're thanking you!  
So for all the things you do,  
Santa Claus we're thanking you!  
(Thank you Santa Claus!)  
(All over the world)
