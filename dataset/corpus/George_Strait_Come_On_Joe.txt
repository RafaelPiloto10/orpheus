Well, it's a long, hot night  
And the stars are shining kinda extra bright  
Sitting on the back porch glidin'  
Whetting my appetite  
  
Well, I'm a six-pack high  
And start missing the light of my baby's eyes  
Wasn't it beautiful, the kind of a soul they said would never die  
  
Well, it's muggy in the shack  
And the backwoods are black  
'Cause the clouds hid the moon away  
The light from my cigarette flickers in the dark  
The only way she knows I'm here  
Then suddenly the sounds of the fiddles and accordions  
Sweetly begin to play and I can almost hear her sweet voice say  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on Joe, just count to ten  
Pull yourself together again  
And come on Joe, you gotta get hold of this mood you're in  
Come on Joe, you gotta be strong  
You're still young and life goes on to carry on  
'Til we're together again  
  
Hey, I know she's right  
But it's hard to fight when you're hurtin' so  
I tried to walk out of that door before but I just can't go  
With the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room  
Wasn't it beautiful  
Wasn't it the kind of happiness and glow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on Joe  
Hey, come on Joe  
To carry on 'til we're together again
