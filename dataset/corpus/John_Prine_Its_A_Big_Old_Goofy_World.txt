Up in the morning  
Work like a dog  
Is better than sitting  
Like a bump on a log  
Mind all your manners  
Be quiet as a mouse  
Some day you'll own a home  
That's as big as a house  
  
I know a fella  
He eats like a horse  
Knocks his old balls  
Round the old golf course  
You oughta see his wife  
She's a cute little dish  
She smokes like a chimney  
And drinks like a fish  
  
There's a big old goofy man  
Dancing with a big old goofy girl  
Ooh baby  
It's a big old goofy world  
  
Now Elvis had a woman  
With a head like a rock  
I wished I had a woman  
That made my knees knock  
She'd sing like an angel  
And eat like a bird  
And if I wrote a song  
She'd know ever single word  
  
Kiss a little baby  
Give the world a smile  
If you take an inch  
Give 'em back a mile  
Cause if you lie like a rug  
And you don't give a damn  
You're never gonna be  
As happy as a clam  
  
So I'm sitting in a hotel  
Trying to write a song  
My head is just as empty  
As the day is long  
Why it's clear as a bell  
I should have gone to school  
I'd be wise as an owl  
Stead of stubborn as a mule.
