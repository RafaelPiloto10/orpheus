When you're down, and confused  
And you don't remember who you been talking to  
Concentration, slips away  
Because your baby, is so far away  
  
Well there's a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey  
Love the one you're with  
Love the one you're with  
  
Don't be angry, don't be sad  
When you sit down and think about  
All those good times that we've had  
There's a girl, right next to you  
And she's just waiting, for something to do  
  
Well there's a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you can't be with the one you love  
Love the one you're with  
Love the one you're with  
  
Do doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
Do doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
Do do doot, Do do doot  
  
Turn your heartache, right into joy  
She's a girl, and you're a boy  
Get it together and make it nice  
You ain't gonna need no more advice
