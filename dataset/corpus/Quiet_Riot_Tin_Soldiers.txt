I'm... A little tin soldier that wants to jump into the fight  
Yes you, you're a look in your eye, a dream passing by in the sky  
Now I don't understand  
But all I need is treat me like a man  
'Cause I ain't no child, take me like I am.  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing to you  
  
All I need, is your whispered "hello", smiles melting from your window  
Your eyes, are deeper than time, sailing on that with the breeze  
So now I've lost my way  
I need help to show me things to say  
Give me your love, before love fades away  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you  
  
I don't need no... Compensation  
And I just got to beg you, listen  
I just got to beg you  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you (watch out)  
I just want some reaction  
Someone to give me satisfaction  
All I've gotta to do is stay next to you  
Some reaction  
A little bit of satisfaction  
All I'm gonna do is get next to you  
I've got to know I'm in love with you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you (yes I am)  
Do anything that you want me to (I'm gonna sing her a song)  
Sing any song that you want me to (right on ta you)  
Sing it to you (Yeah yeah)  
  
I've got to know I'm in love with you (yes I do)  
Do anything that you want me to  
Sing any song that you want me to  
Sing it to you
