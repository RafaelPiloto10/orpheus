Evil Edna she wore sequins to the funeral  
Looked just like a gypsy  
  
Never shed a tear  
Everybody said she looked just like a hooker  
  
Everyone mistook her for the loser of the year  
  
Still the voices of the prophets  
Tell us we should live just so  
  
Enda did not know  
Ah Edna didn't care  
  
Two weeks later, Edna laughed at her confession  
  
Gave the nuns a chill  
Laughed just like a gypsy  
  
  
Everybody said she'd never be forgiven  
Everybody cursed her, said that she was ill  
  
  
Still the voices of the prophets  
Ah Edna didn't care  
Tell us we should live just so  
Oh she did not know  
  
  
Just the other day I heard some people talkin'  
Edna went out walkin' and she passed away  
  
No one knew exactly just what happened  
No one came to mourn her, we all stayed away
