Though my heart won't believe that you have left me  
I keep telling myself that it's true  
I can get over anything  
You are my love  
But I can't get myself over you  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory  
To tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me, my love  
  
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl  
  
Though I tried to forget you somehow  
You're the mirror of my soul  
So take me out of my world  
Let me try to go on living  
Right now  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory  
To tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me, my love
