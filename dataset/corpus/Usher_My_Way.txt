Ooh, Ooh, Hey

Make your girl go oooh-oooh  
Why's he so fly  
She beeps me, whenever she wanna get freaky  
You can get mad if you want Say what ever you want  
But shes still gonna give it up  
  
She likes it my way, my way,  
You can't satisfy her needs  
She keeps running back to see me do it  
My way, my way  
What I say goes, and I'm in control  
  
Bad ass senoritas to sweaters with kicks  
New kicksit's all in the mix  
Don't turn no tricks, they turn for me  
Catchin' bricks don't concern me  
  
So forget it Lil midget, my mind on seven digits  
Before I pay heaven's skies a visit, now it  
I'm pullin' all stops, lockin' down all spots  
Sayin' you can't front on me  
  
So from this day forth you know I'm all about heat  
And what I do be the major league  
That's why your girlfriend's paging me  
And she know like he know, you don't see her like I see her  
  
So she's out the do'  
Shot gun in my drop havin' fun with the Don, system, Bassun  
Conversation about how she be chasin' me  
And facin' me sayin' give it to me now, baby  
  
She likes it my way, my way,  
You can't satasify her needs  
She keeps running bak to see me do it  
My way, my way  
What I say goes, and I'm in control  
  
Don't check me  
It was your girl who let me  
Take it this far then, ooh-wee  
She had to have it every chance that she could get  
  
But you think I'm a baller  
And I ain't gonna call her  
Clip that, you can get mad if you want to  
Say whatever you want...  
  
But she's still gonna give it up  
She likes it....  
  
She likes it my way, my way,  
You can't satisfy her needs  
She keeps running back to see me do it  
My way, my way  
  
What I say goes, and I'm in control
