Your pain ain't love  
Can't you see he's the heartless  
Your pain is not love  
He's taking it too far  
Don't you know it is wrong  
  
You're the one for me lady  
You're the one  
If you'd only see in my heart  
You'd know know all is not lost  
  
Your time is running out  
And you still haven't made up your mind  
Can't you see he's the heartless  
And you're one of a kind  
  
He's the heartless  
You can't you see he's the heartless  
Your pain won't ever be love  
It doesn't matter how hard you try  
To you all is lost  
  
He's the heartless
