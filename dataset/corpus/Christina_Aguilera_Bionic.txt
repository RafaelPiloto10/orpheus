This-this-this-this is the moment that I take over your mind frame  
Step into the picture that I paint you to my brain game  
I let her date you so I give you a migraine  
Over and over, put it on me, later you're insane  
This is a roller coaster that's about to be long gone  
Once you jump in, we're gonna get up on the lump and hold on  
Just let it go, get it up, allow yourself to transform  
Follow me, follow me to a place I know of no return  
  
Are you ready, ready, ready to go?  
Are you ready, ready, ready to go?  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh  
  
I-I-I-I-I am the future, put it on you like a hurricane  
Call me the supernova that's taking over all time and space  
I'm testing your dimension, can't keep up with what I create  
I'll break your concentration, imagination with what I make  
Many times imitated, not duplicated, can't be replaced  
Na-na-now, lemme spell it out, everybody can shout my name,  
X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A  
(Say) X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A-(say)-A-A-(say)  
  
Are you ready, ready, ready to go?  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh
