People just ain't no good  
I think that's well understood  
You can see it everywhere you look  
People just ain't no good  
We were married under cherry trees  
Under blossom we made pour vows  
All the blossoms come sailing down  
Through the streets and through the playgrounds  
The sun would stream on the sheets  
Awoken by the morning bird  
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers  
And never read a single word  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
Seasons came, Seasons went  
The winter stripped the blossoms bare  
A different tree now lines the streets  
Shaking its fists in the air  
The winter slammed us like a fist  
The windows rattling in the gales  
To which she drew the curtains  
Made out of her wedding veils  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good at all  
To our love send a dozen white lilies  
To our love send a coffin of wood  
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo  
That people they just ain't no good  
To our love send back all the letters  
To our love a valentine of blood  
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry  
That people they just ain't no good  
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad  
They can comfort you, some even try  
They nurse you when you're ill of health  
They bury you when you go and die  
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad  
They'd stick by you if they could  
But that's just bullshit  
People just ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good at all
