Michelle, little girl I need you baby  
More than the air I breathe  
My love for you grows stronger babe  
My words you must believe  
Well I need to see you laugh again  
And I want to see you smile  
Michelle, little girl I love you baby  
You're my only child  
Michelle, little girl the pain for you  
Is hurting me inside  
At night I think of you sometimes  
I lean my head and cry  
I need to see you laugh again  
And I wanna see you smile  
Michelle, little girl I love you baby  
You're my only child  
Michelle, little girl I need you baby  
More than the air I breathe  
My love for you grows stronger babe  
My words you must believe  
I need to see you laugh again  
And I wanna see you smile  
Michelle, little girl I love you baby  
You're my only child
