Transdermal celebration  
Caused a slight mutation  
In the rift  
It toppled down a nation  
And left the people running for the hills  
But the mutants that I see  
Shine their beauty unto me  
I wish you could see them  
  
Tectonic tribulation  
Formed a crust of green beyond the reef  
Waves fell in formation  
Cause the plants to bend with spi-ked leaves  
I'm growing with the land  
Time has taken my hands and let me touch them  
  
Hey, hey,  
A billion miles to Mark A  
Lay on the lawn, he's already home  
When the morning ray hits his face  
  
Transdermal celebration  
Jets flew in formation  
I could see them  
Dropping the crustaceans  
Leaving trails of flames in their wake  
But where is the mutation  
Who once told me it was safe, I can't find him
