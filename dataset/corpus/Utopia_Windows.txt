You took that last corner too fast  
Careened up against the side wall  
For a moment everything went black  
Woke up inside somebody else's hideaway in a distant place  
Don't know your name or know this face  
And what you don't know hurts you so  
It can only be that way  
Feel yourself becoming someone else  
We may yet see that light at the end of the tunnel  
If we can find a way to keep things under control  
The web of life connects each of us to the other  
So it's no use pretending that you alone run the show  
Just like a moth too close to the fire explodes  
Though the myth is exposed  
You're still looking for windows in the sky  
Supernatural paradise is the place you are looking for  
All you need is a miracle divine  
All that's left is you alone  
Loneliness is all you own  
Feel yourself becoming someone else
