I'll always love you the same old way  
No matter what may come between  
Just send me a smile  
Once in a lonely while  
Tell me, you'll wait for me  
  
How can I forget you starry eyes  
You hair when its lit by the moonlit skies  
Just keep that smile in you  
'Til I come home to you  
Tell me, you'll wait for me  
  
You're the one, you're the one  
Whom I love, and care so much for  
But now, 'til it ends, I'll just wish to be near  
Caressing you dear  
  
I'll always dream of dreams with you  
Those things we meant to say and do  
Keep them a glow(?)  
Someday we'll make them so  
And tell me, you'll wait for me  
  
I'll always dream of dreams with you  
Those things we meant to say and do  
Keep them a glow(?)  
Someday we'll make them so  
Tell me, you'll wait for me
