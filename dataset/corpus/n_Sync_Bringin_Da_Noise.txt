[Chorus: x2]  
Bring in the noise  
Bring down the house  
We came here to turn the party out  
Say c'mon c'mon lets raise the roof  
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all  
  
We need to get down  
The scene is so so right  
Everybody's in the house tonight  
Loose your mind  
Let your body take control  
You've got that feeling in your soul  
  
I've got that feeling baby  
You know it drives me crazy  
And all I want to do is hit the floor  
I want to shout it though  
So make it louder y'all  
And turn it up some more.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bring in the noise  
Bring in the noise  
  
Just shake it girl  
And enjoy the ride  
Do what you feel inside  
'Cause it's your world  
All you wanted more  
So baby go and get yours  
  
I've got that feeling baby  
You know it drives me crazy  
And all I want to do is hit the floor  
I want to shout it y'all  
So make it louder y'all  
And turn it up some more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bring in the noise [Repeat: x4]  
  
I've got that feeling baby  
You know it drives me crazy  
And all I want to do is hit the floor  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
