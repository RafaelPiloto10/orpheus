Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
So many people, so many problems  
There in the pretty city lights  
Where we've thrown it all away  
Well, if life is here before my eyes  
Then I find it hard to see  
How the methods that we're told to use  
Are gonna make us free  
Until then I say  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
All through the mystery,  
All through the heartache  
She's got the only single thing  
That I'll never throw away  
Oh, if lightning strikes for a second time  
Will you come and pull me through?  
It's a battle that we all must make,  
So show me what to do  
And you said  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land,  
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
fight for ourselves  
  
Fight...Fight  
  
Oh so many people now, there's so many problems  
There in the pretty city lights  
Where we've thrown it all away  
Well, if life is here before my eyes  
Then I find it hard to see  
How the methods that we're told to use  
Are gonna make us free  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land,  
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Fight for ourselves  
Fight for ourselves  
We gotta fight for ourselves  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Fight Fight  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
