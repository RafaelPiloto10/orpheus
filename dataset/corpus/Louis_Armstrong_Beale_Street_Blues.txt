You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns  
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs  
You'll meet honest men and pick-pockets skilled  
You'll find that business never closes  
Till somebody gets killed  
  
If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk  
Married men would have to take their beds and walk  
Except one or two, who never drink booze  
And the blind man on the corner  
Who sings the Beale Street Blues  
  
He said, "I'd rather be there than anyplace I know  
Yes, I'd rather be here, than anyplace I know  
It's gonna take the Sergeant, for to make me go"  
  
I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by  
Yes, I'm goin' to the river and there's a reason why  
Because the river's wet and Beale Street's done gone dry
