I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh  
What hijacked my world that night  
To a place in the past  
We've been cast out of? Oh oh oh oh  
Now we're back in the fight  
We're back on the train  
Oh, back on the chain gang  
  
A circumstance beyond our control, oh oh oh oh  
The phone, the TV and the news of the world  
Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh oh oh oh  
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies  
Put us back on the train  
Oh, back on the chain gang  
  
The powers that be  
That force us to live like we do  
Bring me to my knees  
When I see what they've done to you  
But I'll die as I stand here today  
Knowing that deep in my heart  
They'll fall to ruin one day  
For making us part  
  
I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh  
Those were the happiest days of my life  
Like a break in the battle was your part, oh oh oh oh  
In the wretched life of a lonely heart  
Now we're back on the train  
Oh, back on the chain gang
