Met this fine young thing  
At the local Circle K  
We made a date for a half past eight  
And I said, "What the hey?"  
  
So I journeyed to her crib  
And I let myself inside  
That chick was slouched down on the couch  
I think her brain was fried  
  
Couldn't figure it out  
She wouldn't even look at me  
Then I saw her eyes, she was hypnotized  
Cold glued to her TV  
  
"Hey, what's your problem baby doll  
Let's have a little fling"  
She said, "Hey you fool, now just be cool  
I'm watchin' that Gilligan's Isle thing"  
  
Isle thing  
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing  
  
Watchin' all night  
Musta, been a marathon  
I was bummin', those shows kept comin'  
Here's what was goin' on  
  
These castaways were stranded  
On this island out at sea  
One of them called Gilligan  
So let's name him after m  
  
He'd mess up every rescue  
Man, that first mate was illin'  
If I was one of those castaways  
I think I'd probably kill 'I'm  
  
Just about that time  
Telephone began to ring  
She said, "Just let it, my machine'll get  
We're watchin' the Gilligan's Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
She loves that Gilligan's Isle thing  
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing  
Please, baby, baby, please  
  
I like the professor  
He always saves their butts  
He could build a nuclear reactor  
From a couple of coconuts  
  
She said, "That guy's a genius"  
I shook my head and laughed  
I said, "If he's so fly, they tell me why  
He couldn't build a lousy raft"  
  
And while we're on the subject  
I'll tell you one thing for sure  
Those homeboys brought an awful lot  
For just a three hour tour  
  
Then her mom came in the room  
It was kind of embarrassing  
She said, "Hey you two, I was once like you  
And I loved that Gilligan's Isle thing"  
  
Isle thing  
She'd watch that Gilligan's Isle thing  
Please, baby, baby, please  
  
Skipper's in a hammock  
He's looking kinda fat  
He'd throw a fit and then he'd hit  
Old Gilligan with his hat  
  
Mrs. Hal had it goin' on  
But Mr. Hal was meaner  
Ginger and Mary Anne could've used  
Some funky cold medina (?)  
  
I was really diggin' this show  
I didn't know what to do  
It kinda looked like I was hooked  
Now I'm an addict too  
  
I know each episode by heart  
Now I'm the rerun king  
And on every date we both stay up late  
And we watch the Gilligan's Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
Hasta la vista, little buddy  
Gilligan's Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing
