Right from early days from the moment I was born  
I would take my guitar in the early early mornin'  
And go down to the fields and play-ay-ay  
Sittin' down there in the long grass strummin'  
I could see the people from miles around comin'  
To hear me sing my music and play-ay-ay  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life yeah and I wouldn't spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin' down somewhere playin' away my days  
Well we made it to the city just me and my guitar  
That was where I found a freaky little bar  
I sat there on the stage and play-ay-ayed  
Well up came a guy who said it wasn't plastic  
He wanted me to sing away my life or something drastic  
But all I want to do is play-ay-ay  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life yeah and I wouldn't spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin' down somewhere playin' away my days  
Well fame and fortune I've let them pass me by  
No one in the country could say I didn't try  
To turn the people and to play-ay-ay  
You can keep all the money and the places that go with it  
'Cause all I want is freedom and no cash could ever get it  
All I want to do is play-ay-ay  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life my kinda life  
(Yes and I like it)  
Well that's been my kinda life yeah and I wouldn't spend it anywhere  
Other than sittin' down somewhere playin' away my days
