Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day  
Boss Man, Boss Man turn it around  
If you don't look away how can I sit down  
  
Look at this load upon my back  
Gotta get this wheel back on the track  
I can't hold on but I can't let go  
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no'  
  
Holes in my pockets and holes in my shoes  
If you're ready for me I'm ready for you  
The company plan takes all my pay  
Got a child in July and another last May  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day  
Push your face down in the coal  
'Cause you got no heart you got no soul  
  
Country life's the life for me  
In ten more years I'll a pensioner be  
The younger lad knows when the girls are out  
But you might say he's a rural sprout  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day  
Boss Man, Boss Man clear the track  
You're gonna tear the skin right offa my back  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
If you can't lend a hand then get outta my way  
It'll be murder in the first degree  
If you ever lay your hands on me  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man pay my rent  
A dollar I've earned is a dollar I've spent  
The company plan takes all my check  
For breakin' my back and riskin' my neck  
  
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say  
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day  
I can't hold on but I can't let go  
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no
