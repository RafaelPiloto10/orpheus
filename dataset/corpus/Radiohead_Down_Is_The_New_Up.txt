Get yourself together  
Let the light pour in  
Pour yourself a hot bath  
Pour yourself a drink  
Nothing's gonna happen without warning  
  
Down is the new up  
What is up, buttercup?  
  
Down is the new up  
Is the new up  
  
Won't you be my girl?  
Won't you be my girl?  
  
Your services  
Are not required  
Your future's bleak  
You're so last week  
  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Without a safety net  
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop  
I shall now amputate  
I shall now contort  
  
Because down is the new up  
What if I just flip-flop?  
  
Down is the new up  
Down is the new up  
Down is the new up  
Is the new up  
  
You crawled off and left us  
You crawled off and left us  
You crawled off and left us  
  
All on candid camera  
The chink in your armour  
Topsy turvy town  
Topsy turvy town  
  
Shake your pockets out  
Pass it on  
Pass it down  
Topsy turvy town  
Topsy turvy town
