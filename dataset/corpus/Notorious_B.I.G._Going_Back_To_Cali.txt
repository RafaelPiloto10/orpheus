[Verse 1]  
When the lala hits  
The lyrics jus splits you  
Head so hard, that ya hat can't fit you  
Either I'm with ya or against you  
Form that bent you  
Back through the maze I sent you  
Talkin to tha rap inventor  
Nigga wit the game tight  
Fit that flame right  
Spell my name right  
Be -I-double g-I-e  
Iced out lights out  
Me and Cees-a-leaah  
Gettin head from some chick he kno  
See its all about the chedda  
Nobody do it betta  
Goin back tah cali  
Strictly for tha weatha  
Women, and the weed  
Stinky green  
No cees bitch please  
Poppa ain't soft  
Get up in the hood  
Ain't no love lost  
Got me mixed up  
You drunk them lics up  
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked  
And my balls licked  
Forfeit  
The game is mine  
I'ma spell my name one more time  
Check it  
Its the  
N-o--t-o--are-I--o--you-s  
You just  
Lay down  
Slow  
Recognize a real don when you see juan  
Sippin on booze in the house of blues  
  
[Chorus 4x]  
I'm going going...back back...to Cali Cali  
  
[Verse 2]  
If I got choose a coast I got to choose the East  
I live out there, so don't go there  
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West  
See some nice breasts in the West  
Smoke some nice cess in the West  
Why'all niggaz is a mess  
Thinkin I'm goin stop  
Givin L.A. props  
All I got is beef with those that violate me  
I shall annihilate thee  
Case closed  
Suitcase filled with clothes  
Linens and things  
I begin things  
People start to flash  
818s, 213s, 313s  
B.I.G.  
Frequently floss hoes at Rosco's  
If I want to sport her  
Take her to Fatburger  
Spend about a week on Venice Beach  
Sippin Crisco  
With some freaks from Frisco  
  
[Chorus 4x]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Cali got gunplay  
Models on the runway  
Scream biggie biggie gimme one more chance  
I be whippin on the freeway  
The NYC way  
On the celly-celly with mah homeboy lance  
Pass hash from left to right  
Only got 5 blunts left to light  
I'm set tonight  
Paid a visit to Versace stores  
Lets see somethin till I ain't got no more  
Only in L.A.  
Motherfuckin 'zelay  
Rub it in they tummy  
Lick it, say its yummy  
Then fuck yo man  
Fuck yo plans  
Is it to rock tha tristate?  
Almost gold  
5 gz and showgate  
Or do you want to see about 7 digits  
Fuckin hoes  
Exquisite  
Cali...great place to visit  
[Chorus 4x]
