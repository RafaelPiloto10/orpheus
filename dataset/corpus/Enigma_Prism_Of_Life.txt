I am hunted by the future  
Will the future be my past?  
Or is time a fade out picture  
Of my everlasting cast?  
  
Love is phasing  
Love is moving  
To the rhythm of your sight  
I get closer  
To the crossing point of light  
  
Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.  
Pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria tua.  
Hosanna in excelsis. Benedictus  
(Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts.  
Heaven and earth are filled with Thy glory.  
Hosanna in the highest.  
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  
Hosanna in the highest.)  
  
Let us try to live our lost illusions  
They're the sun at night  
If we don't we'll never taste  
The spice of life  
  
And when it seems that we're in a dead end street  
There's no reason to cry  
Cause we have a helping hand who's always aside  
  
Forever light
