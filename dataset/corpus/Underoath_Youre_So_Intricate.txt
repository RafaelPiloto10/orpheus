Like I said  
Leave your baggage at the back door  
I'm leaving you the way I think it should be  
We're always pulling into spaces that we can't back out of  
Starting fights we can't talk our way out of them  
How does it feel to be on the receiving end of this one?  
This night will swell with us this night will run with us  
This is our last surviving chance I wanna survive 2x s  
Feast your eyes (swell with us), I don't care  
I'll fantasize of being manic  
And leaving us behind  
In your eyes you were the one that tried  
Acceptance is what holds us here  
And you my dear are the one I fear tonight  
We'll try just one more time  
This is the moment that we all live for  
Are you ready? Are you ready?  
This night will swell with us this night will run with us  
This is our last surviving chance I wanna survive 2x s  
Feast your eyes (run with us), I don't care I don't care I don't care  
And I'll never care  
I can't see past your waving hand  
Just running away again  
I can't see past your waving hand  
Just running away again  
You think so loud it hurts my ears  
I wanna know how to get through this, how to get  
Through this with out choking up 2x s  
I can't feel you your so far from me!
