Oh, You gotta move on now  
I can see, I can feel, The tears in your eyes  
The tears that you cry, you gotta move on now  
Let me wipe those tears from your eyes  
If I could only take his place, On the other side  
I can see, I can feel, The tears in his eyes  
The tears that he cries  
We need each other  
In the darkest of night, He's all I have  
Solo : Andy  
Time is running out, To find another soul  
Time is running out, To find another soul  
You gotta move on now, You gotta move on now  
And find another house before the dawn is coming in  
Moving on, Moving on, Oh yeah  
Before the dawn is coming in, find a soul that's free of sin  
I'm trying, Crying, I'm trying, I don't know if I can  
You gotta move on now, You gotta move on now  
And find another house before the dawn is coming in  
Find a soul that's free on sin  
Time is running out, I'm moving on  
Time is running out, I'm moving on  
On the other side  
I can see, I can feel, The tears in his eyes  
The tears that he cries  
We need each other  
In the darkest of night  
I'm moving on to THIS house
