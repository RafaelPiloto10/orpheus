Street lights start to come on  
I know that it's time  
Stop what you're doing  
Meet those drinking friends of mine  
First lady call me on the telephone  
She said 'Get out and die young but I'm staying at home'  
Now I believe in love, I believe that it's true  
Know I'm defenceless when I look into blue  
Sleepy eyes down an angel's face  
Don't worry honey no-one's gonna take your place  
  
The closer you get, the better you look  
Throw me a line  
'Cause the closer you get, the more that I see  
We'll sure have a good time  
I know what you're thinking, well how do I feel?  
We'll there's no rules in my book  
Except the closer you get, the better you look  
  
Keep one foot in the showroom, one out of sight  
Girl I've had some close ones but I'm doing all right  
Gold on her fingers don't mean a thing  
He'll do his best to hear that sweet lady sing  
Now I got the time if you got the place  
We've got the know how and you got the face  
We got the power, we got no shame  
Come over baby, I sure do want to light your flame  
'Cause the closer you get, the better you look  
Throw me a line  
The closer you get, the more that I see  
We'll sure have a good time  
I know what you're thinking, well how do I feel?  
We'll there's no rules in my book  
Except the closer you get, the better you look
