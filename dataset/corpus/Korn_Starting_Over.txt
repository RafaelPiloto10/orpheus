Got to face your fear  
Lying on the floor  
Spinning to nothing  
What the hell am I here for  
So come on and play  
Stab me in the heart  
So long this time was wasted ripping me apart  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the hurt inside your head  
Lost in the boil waters dead  
Constantly twisting things I've said  
Happiness is boiling pain instead  
  
Its starting over (x2)  
Can't stand it's over  
God is gonna to take me out  
My time is over  
This time is over  
Why is this over God is gonna take me out  
  
God is gonna take me out (x4)  
  
Crawling on the floor  
All around this space  
Talking to myself why is this thing I got to face  
Walking through a door  
Has it been a waste  
Going on and on  
Thinking I could find my place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's starting over (x2)  
Can't stand it's over  
God is gonna to take me out  
My time is over  
This time is over  
Why is this over  
God is gonna take me out  
  
God is gonna take me out(x6)  
  
You can see  
I'm torn away from you  
And everything that's close to me  
I can't not face the truth  
It's nothing that I believe  
Just ran away from me  
And thank me when your free from me  
Come take me  
  
Come take me(x4)  
  
[Chorus x2]
