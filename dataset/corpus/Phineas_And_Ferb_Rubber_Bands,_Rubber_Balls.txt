Rubber bands, rubber balls  
Made with super-special density  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
They can bounce with such intensity  
  
This is the room where we test the stretching  
This is the room where we test the bounce  
Here we add the long-chained hydrocarbons  
The names of which I cannot pronounce  
  
This is the room where we test compression  
This is the room where we test recoil  
This is a break room for all these dancers  
And here's a little fridge so the curry won't spoil  
  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
Made with super-special density  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
They can bounce with such intensity  
  
Basically what we make here is rubber  
We're not trying to diversify  
We don't make knickknacks, we don't make tchotchkes  
Or really anything that's gonna catch your eye  
  
We don't make pianos, we don't make cream sodas  
We don't make the zippers for your parachute pants  
We don't make ice cube trays or ceiling fans  
We make rubber bands! [last note held until end of song]  
  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
Made with super-special density  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
They can bounce with such intensity
