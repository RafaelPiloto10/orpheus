I believe you  
When you say that you will reach into the sky  
And steal a star so you can put it on my finger  
I believe you  
Baby, I believe you  
  
I believe you  
When you say that every time that we make love  
Will be the first time we've made love  
And every act of love will please you  
Baby, I believe you  
  
Blind faith makes me follow you  
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to  
Just ask me and I'll marry you  
You don't have to sell me  
Cause you overwhelm me  
I've made up my mind for a life time  
I believe you  
When you swear your love will keep on growin' strong  
And that forever isn't long enough to love me like you need to  
Baby, I believe you  
Baby, I believe you  
Honey, I love you  
  
Blind faith makes me follow you  
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to  
Just ask me and I'll marry you  
You don't have to sell me  
Cause you overwhelm me  
I've made up my mind for a life time  
I believe you  
When you swear your love will keep on growin' strong  
And that forever isn't long enough to love me like you need to  
Baby, I believe you  
Baby, I believe you  
Honey, I love you  
  
I believe you  
When you say you'll fill my body with your soul  
And love will grow into a freckled little girl  
Who looks like we do  
Baby, I believe you  
Baby, I believe you
