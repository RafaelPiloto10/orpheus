Sitting here waiting on a new situation  
On my way back to a known destination  
I tried all night but I couldn't find the answers  
No  
I gotta make it work cause I'm running out of chances  
Yeah must be out of my mind  
  
And all the melodies coming back to me  
I think I'm feeling just fine  
City lights and just a few more miles to go  
I do this all the time  
why do I draw these lines  
They keep me out of reach  
It's not what I wanted no  
But it brings me to my knees  
Over and over  
Over and over  
  
Sitting here waiting on a new conversation  
You're talking out of turn man I'm running out of patience  
  
And all the melodies are coming back to me  
I think I'm feeling just fine  
City lights and just a few more miles to go  
I do this all the time  
Why do I draw these lines  
Keep me out of reach  
It's not what I wanted no  
But it might be what I need  
  
And I do this all the time why do I draw these lines  
They keep me out of reach  
It's not what I wanted but it brings me to my knees  
Over and over  
Over and over  
  
Sunny days  
God I swear there must be  
Sunny days  
Up ahead or in between  
Sunny days  
Think I found you in this place  
Over and over  
Over and over  
Over and over  
Over and over  
And again
