Divided we stand in the light of a frozen sun  
Cursing the Gods we have become  
We steal the fire from a sacred heart  
And bleed the wine unholy  
We fall in love with the serpent's song  
And fear nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
We're born again -  
Dead  
  
"Forever we are  
Forever we've been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream"  
  
Deranged we're tearing away the petals of desire  
Learning the mathematics of evil by heart  
We deceive ourselves to start a war  
Within the realm of senses  
And descend to the circle number four  
Where we are nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
We're born again -  
Dead  
  
"Forever we are  
Forever we've been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream"
