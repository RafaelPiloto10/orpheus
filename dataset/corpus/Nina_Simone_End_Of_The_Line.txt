This is the end of the line  
I've clearly read ever sign  
The way you glance at me  
Indifferently  
And take your hand from mine  
This is the end of the line  
How can I ever be fine  
How helpless I've become  
I feel like some discarded valentine  
Remember in the biginniunfg  
Your winning ways excited me  
And all the while I was certain  
That we two found a love that comes just to a few  
We've reached the end of the line  
I hope your dreams turn out fine  
I'm awfully tired  
And so I guess I'll go  
Although it's only nine  
But this is the end of the line  
The end of the line
