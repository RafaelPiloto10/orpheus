Got a bran' new suit  
Got a bran' new tie  
Got a bran' new twinkle in my eye  
Do you know the reason why?  
  
Got a bran' new girl  
An' I won't dispute  
She's the reason why I got a bran' new tie  
An' a bran' new suit  
  
When I'm with her  
Gotta look my best  
Put on my tan shoes  
Gray spats, double breasted vest  
  
Gonna wear my stickpin, a Tecla Pearl  
With a bran' new tie  
An' a bran' new suit  
A bran' new girl
