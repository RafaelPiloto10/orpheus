You're not alone  
Together we stand  
I'll be by your side  
You know I'll take your hand  
  
When it gets cold  
And it feels like the end  
There's no place to go  
You know I won't give in  
  
No I won't give in  
  
Keep holding on,  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through  
Just stay strong  
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you  
  
There's nothing you can say  
(Nothing you can say)  
  
Nothing you can do  
(Nothing you can do)  
  
There's no other way when it comes to the truth, so  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through  
  
So far away  
I wish you were here  
Before it's too late  
This could all disappear  
  
Before the doors close  
And it comes to an end  
With you by my side  
I will fight and defend, I'll fight and defend ya ya  
  
Keep holding on,  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through  
Just stay strong  
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you  
  
There's nothing you can say  
(Nothing you can say)  
  
Nothing you can do  
(Nothing you can do)  
  
There's no other way  
When it comes to the truth so  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through  
Hear me when I say when I say I'll believe  
Nothing gonna change nothings gonna change destiny  
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly  
  
Ya ya ya ya, la la la la la  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through  
Just stay strong  
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you  
  
There's nothing you can say  
(Nothing you can say)  
  
Nothing you can do  
(Nothing you can do)  
  
There's no other way  
When it comes to the truth so  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha

Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Keep holding on  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Keep holding on  
  
There's nothing you can say

Nothing you can do

When it comes to the truth so  
Keep holding on  
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
