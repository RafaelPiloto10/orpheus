Words and music by bob seger  
I woke up with this feeling  
There was something I wanted to say  
So I wrote you a song.  
  
Lately girl I've been dreamin'  
Dreamin' 'bout you all through the day  
So I wrote you a song.  
  
Hope the words will be right  
When I see you tonight,  
You'll know how I feel.  
I'm no longer alone,  
Think I've found me a home  
And I think it's real.  
  
I woke up with this feeling  
Haven't felt it for quite some time,  
So I wrote you a song.  
  
All these thoughts I've been dreaming  
Somehow I've got to make them right,  
Got to make them belong.  
Everytime that you're here  
Everytime that you're near  
Everything is real.  
I'm no longer alone,  
Think I've found me a home,  
And I think it's real,  
So I wrote you a song.
