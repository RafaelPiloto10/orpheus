Wherever you go, wherever  
You may wander in your life  
Surely you know, I  
Always wanna be there  
  
Holding your hand  
And standing by to  
Catch you when you fall  
Seeing you through  
In everything you do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me be there in your morning  
Let me be there in your night  
Let me change whatever's  
Wrong and make it right  
Let me take you  
Through that wonderland  
That only two can share  
All I ask you is let me be there  
  
Watching you grow and going  
Through the changes in your life  
That's how I know, I'll  
Always wanna be there  
  
Whenever you feel you need  
A friend to lean on, here I am  
Whenever you call  
You know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus:] 2X  
  
All I ask you is let me be there
