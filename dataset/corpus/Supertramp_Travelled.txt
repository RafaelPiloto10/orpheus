Traveled the world in million ways  
Catching the palm in familiar gaze  
Everyone lives by two hard eyes  
There's no one with time to laugh or cry  
There's no one to tell us what we're living for  
  
And though I tried to be a good man  
I just know that I'll be losing very soon  
And there are times and there are motions  
When I do believe I'm going out of tune, oh  
  
I've been around a long, long while  
Looking for sun to make me smile  
But still multiply their daily bread  
They're thinking their lives put times ahead  
It must be a mighty funny way to feel  
  
And though I tried to be a good man  
I keep finding out there's nowhere to begin  
And so I think I'll go on singing  
And in time I hope that we can all join in, oh
