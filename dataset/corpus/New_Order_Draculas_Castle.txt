What's the matter here?  
Something ain't right  
Tell me it's not true  
Tell me it's all right  
  
There was time I'd run around for you  
Get down on my knees  
I swear it's true  
But you came in the night,  
And you took my heart  
To Dracula's Castle  
In the Dark  
  
Now I've gotta tell you  
Now you've gotta know  
I want you to stay  
But you're gonna go  
  
Don't leave me alone  
You'll tear me apart  
You're in control  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I can't explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel  
  
You can't keep on running  
How far'd you think you'll get  
You got the world if you want it  
I ain't done with you yet  
  
I work hard just to keep you by my side  
Every day and almost every night  
In the end you took away my heart  
Left me alone  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I can't explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I can't explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel
