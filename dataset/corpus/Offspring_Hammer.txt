I'm gonna be a slam-er,  
I'm gonna be the wildest,  
I'm gonna be your hammer,  
No one's the nicest,  
But me!  
I'm not a worker,  
I'm not a joker,  
I'm a man who is dropin,  
Dropin', is dropin' a Hammerdown on you!  
I'm fightin' against you,  
I'm Bombin' your House  
O-you-T!!!  
Come on let'me kill ya!!!  
I'm not a worker,  
I'm not a joker,  
I'm a man who is dropin,  
Dropin, is dropin' a Hammer  
Down on you!  
I've fighted against you,  
I've bombed your houseo-you-T!!!  
And I've killed ya!!!  
But what did I do?  
I've killed my soul!  
I'm not a worker,  
I'm not a joker,  
I'm the sadest man alive!!!
