I want to know what you've got to say  
Don't want to wait any longer  
I feel a shook up since you walked my way  
You make me feel so much stronger  
  
Hey little baby  
I want to go your way  
  
This time  
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love  
This time  
Don't want to be a part of playing the game of higher love  
When you're mine  
  
Now you see what you've done to me  
Don't want to wait so much longer  
I feel sideways up since you walked my way  
My feel for you keeps getting stronger  
  
Hey little baby  
I want to go your way  
  
This time  
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love  
This time  
Don't want to be a part of playing the game of higher love  
Just make you mine
