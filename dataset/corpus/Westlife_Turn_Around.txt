Some people are lucky baby  
I guess I am too  
Love found me  
And I found you  
And every time I think it can't get better  
You do something new  
And I'm renewed  
  
And when it gets cold  
And I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
For feeling the way that I do  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
To put my faith in you  
Even when you let me down  
I forgive you  
'cause I know that you're feeling it too  
Anytime I turn around  
Make me believe it  
The things that I already knew  
  
Mark: you lock me up in kisses baby  
Here to toe  
Let the whole world stare  
I don't care  
You make me breakfast in bed  
Just to show me  
No-one wants me no more  
I'm secure  
  
And when it gets cold and  
I think its over  
Look what you go and do  
  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
For feeling the way that I do  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
To put my faith in you  
Even when you let me down  
I forgive you  
'cause I know that you're feeling it too  
Anytime I turn around  
Make me believe it  
The things that I already knew  
  
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around  
  
Cause you know  
That I know  
That it's hard to let go  
So why not hold on  
Hold on to us  
'cause you know  
That I know  
That it's hard to let go  
So why not hold on  
  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
For feeling the way that I do  
Every time I turn around  
Give me a reason  
To put my faith in you  
Even when you let me down  
I forgive you  
'cause I know that you're feeling it too  
Anytime I turn around  
Make me believe it  
The things that I already knew  
  
Every time I turn around

Look what you go and do  
  
Anytime I turn around  
  
And when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do  
Every time I turn around  
  
And when it gets cold and  
I think it's over  
Look what you go and do
