You bring hope, You bring life  
Awaken hearts open eyes  
With our voices hidden eyes  
We call these dry bones to come alive  
You are faithful you are truth  
We can always run to  
  
Love that never fails  
Arms that never close  
Blood that covers sin  
Grace that never ends  
  
[Chorus]  
You have saved us, you have won  
Sin is broken, death is gone  
Freedom's found us  
Breakthrough's near, in Your presence  
No more fear  
Our Savior's here, our Savior's here  
  
Faith is stirring  
Hearts are free  
Chains are broken and we believe  
You are mighty you come through  
We can always run to  
  
Love that never fails  
Arms that never close  
Blood that covers sin  
Grace that never ends  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Our God saves  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Our God saves  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Our God saves  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Savior's here, our Savior's here, Savior's here
