Uh uh uh uh-huh  
Uh uh that joint is hot baby!  
  
Lights, camera, action, hold up  
You know my style, I been blowed up  
Paper was young, now it's growed up  
Stacks so thick it's hard to fold up  
Yo b, find another rubber band in the truck  
Count up the money, I'ma stand in the cut  
Stroll in the party and I toast Cris' up  
Tell that a muh-hucca gets this up  
Shake that cookie like what like what  
Toss me a drop it's like lightning struck  
Look at that apple cobbler butt  
Whatchu want to do, whatchu think? Want cut  
NBA Live in my truck  
Parkin' lot like all jammed up  
If there's beef it's best you duck  
I'm gon' eat 'til I'm filled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw it to me, that apple cobbler  
Baby it, can I see (can I see) that apple pie?  
I said throw it to me, that apple cobbler  
Baby it, can I get (hey) can I get it deep fried?  
  
So much sugar it's makin' my head rush  
Tell me what the recipe is for that stuff  
Break me off a piece of crust  
I'm so full I'm bout to bust  
Just one slice is not enough  
Dang that thang tight like handcuffs  
What I gotta say to you for you to give it up?  
What if I was payin' you so you could live it up?  
Hoochie seats inside yo' truck  
Tiffany rocks and trillion cuts  
You be Starsky, I be Hutch  
Ride shotgun, I pop that clutch  
Juicy sweatpants drive me nuts  
Take my 2-way, stay in touch  
I'm gon' scoop you, heat you up  
Take you, bake you, eat you up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turn that hair 'round, buck them hips  
Love when your hair get stuck to your lips  
Apple cobbler sweet and thick  
I'm gon' eat you 'til I'm sick  
Yo' dessert is worth a grip  
I admit you make me trip  
Make me want to run to the mall like I'm a trick  
I can't believe you're makin' a baller have a fit  
Trippin', switchin' past my clique  
Lick that juicy, ask my clique  
Stretch them jeans girl make them fit  
Make me go outside and pit  
You know me, my cake is sick  
Me and Timbo makin' hits  
Apple cobbler, thick and rich  
Just how hot can one girl get?  
  
[Chorus]
