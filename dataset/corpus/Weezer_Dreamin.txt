[Chorus]  
I'm dreamin'  
In the mornin'  
I'm dreamin' all  
Through the night  
And when I'm dreamin'  
I know  
That it's all right  
Woo, hoo, hoa  
I'm dreamin'  
In the evening  
I'm dreamin'  
All through the day  
And when I'm dreamin'  
I know that it's okay  
Woo, hoo, hoa  
  
Daddy says  
I've gotta pay  
Some bills  
So I can learn  
To be responsible  
Some day I'll have  
A family of my own  
And they  
Will need for me  
To be full grown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Teacher says  
I gotta learn some facts  
So I can make it in  
The Widener Stacks  
These are days  
That will define my life  
I shouldn't waste them  
On these friends of mine  
  
But I  
Gotta be a big boy  
(Cause I really want a chance)  
Gotta pick up my toys  
(Cause I really want a chance)  
  
When I start to feel  
The feeling comin' over me  
(I really want a chance)  
I soon forget  
All about responsibility  
(I really want a chance)  
I walk around  
In a wide-awake daydream  
(I really want a chance)  
Things are better out here  
Than they might seem  
  
There are bluebirds  
In the meadows  
And the bees  
Are flying around  
And the gosling's  
At the river  
At a loss so far  
From the ground  
  
I am running  
(I am running)  
Through the meadow  
(Through the meadow)  
And the sun is  
(And the sun is)  
Shining on me  
(Shining on me)  
I am singing  
(I am singing)  
My voice is ringing  
(My voice is ringing)  
I can sing so loud  
(I can sing so loud)  
  
And the angels  
(And the angels)  
In the heavens  
(In the heavens)  
They are wondering  
(They are wondering)  
"Why am I so glad?"  
(Why am I so glad?)  
"Why am I so glad?"  
(Why am I so glad?)  
"Why am I so"  
(Why am I so)  
"Why am I so"  
(Why am I so)  
I am running  
(I am running)  
Through the meadow  
(Through the meadow)  
And the sun is  
(And the sun is)  
Shining on me  
(Shining on me)  
I am singing  
(I am singing)  
My voice is ringing  
(My voice is ringing)  
I can sing so loud  
(I can sing so loud)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to get  
With your program  
I don't want to get  
With your program  
I don't want to get  
With your program  
Take back the love
