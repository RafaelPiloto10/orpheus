Rikky Rock'n Roller now that you're the headline  
Rikky Rock'n Roller don't it make you feel fine  
Is it true to hear the fans scream  
To stand in the lights is just like a dream  
What a dream  
To be what you are, a rock and roll star  
To make such a lot of money  
Would be funny  
Oh I wish I could be like you Rikky Rock'n Roller  
  
Today a new jet plane  
Tonight it's a new hotel  
You live in your own world  
You're under a magic spell
