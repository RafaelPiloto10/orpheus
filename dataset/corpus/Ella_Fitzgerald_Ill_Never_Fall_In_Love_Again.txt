What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a guy?  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do, he'll never phone you  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you need a guy?  
You get enough tears to feel an ocean  
That's what you get for your devotion  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
Nothing but pain, lies, and sorrow  
So for at least until tomorrow  
I'll never fall in love again
