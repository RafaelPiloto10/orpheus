Oh a family of bards  
A travelling went to distant lands  
A singing sweet  
With pipes and strings and an open  
Heart,just to wish their brothers  
The good life  
  
[Chorus:]  
Greensleeves was all our joy  
Greensleeves was our delight  
Greensleeves our heart of gold  
And who but our noble greensleeves  
  
In Dante's land, oh there they  
Marble strong,to see this celtic  
Bloods sincerety, a look a smile  
Even a tiny gift and turned  
Their backs though curtesely  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Then come to the citiy of a waltz  
They say: "There they'll love you, passionately"  
But in truth they were given no time and even scorned  
For the city of music  
Is gone for gold  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So they danced their way  
Though scared and pained  
To Shiller's sweet haven  
And dearest folk and at last  
They were watched with wondering love  
And that lifted this family's saddened heart
