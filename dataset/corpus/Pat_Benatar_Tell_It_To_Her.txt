I'm the one you put all your stories on  
She's the one, you keep it a secret from  
She believes you, just like I did at the start  
When you wrapped up my heart, and played with my emotions  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell it to her  
Cause I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I know why she would  
There's a fool born every minute  
When you're in it, it feels so good  
Why don't you tell it to her  
  
She don't know the darker side of you  
She don't know what your love will put her through  
Your sweet talkin' makes her feel so safe and sure  
But that won't change what you are  
And I'm the one who knows it  
  
[Chorus[  
  
'Cause I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I know why she would  
There's a fool born every minute  
When you're in it, it feels so good  
  
You're the one who had it all and wanted more  
But you can't do it to me anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
Go on and tell it to her  
Tell it to her  
There's a fool born every minute  
Tell it to her  
Go on and tell it to her  
Tell it to her
