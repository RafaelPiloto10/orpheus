Where is the sun,  
The sun that used to shine on me?  
Where has it gone  
Or is it just a memory?  
  
I looked through the window,  
Staring at the sky,  
Waiting for a moment  
That always passed me by.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black summer rain,  
Black summer rain,  
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl.  
  
Where is the love,  
The love I need to set me free?  
And how can I escape  
This gloom that is swallowing me?  
  
[Chorus: x2]
