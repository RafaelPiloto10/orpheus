She's interested in me  
I'm interested in her  
But there's a distance  
Each morning as she walks  
Our eyes exchange a thought  
Our hearts, an interest  
I've seen her at the club  
Expanding with the funk  
She looks so brilliant  
She sticks close to her friends  
And when the music ends  
She is the Indian  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
I'm interested to meet  
The girl that looks at me  
I will be trying  
Her color unlike mine  
Her hair the plaited vine  
I will be climbing  
My leg is always pulled  
By friends who really would  
But say they wouldn't  
The joke's against my heart  
Immediately she's barred  
Their hearts are wooden  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
I'm interested in her  
She's interested in me  
Her distance shortens  
She walks towards the light  
I walk towards the lines  
That seem important  
I'm counting up to ten  
By five she's gone again  
Into the distance  
I'll try again to nudge my  
Courage for the love look  
Without resistance  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you
