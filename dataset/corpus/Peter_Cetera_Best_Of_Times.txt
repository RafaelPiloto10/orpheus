Things get bad, times get tough  
Everybody knows  
You gotta be a little stronger  
Just to have the things you need  
Everybody knows  
If you try a little harder  
You're gonna live a whole lot longer  
  
Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour  
Going out and stayin' far too long  
  
[Chorus:]  
You got to believe in something  
When you believe in something  
These are the best of times  
You got to have faith in someone  
When you have faith in someone  
These are the best of times  
  
Don't give up, can't give in  
Never lose a minute  
It's a long hard road back from nowhere  
Love is not what you take out  
It's what you put back in it  
Take you chance, there's no doubt  
Everything will all work out  
  
See my way, I know where I'm goin'  
I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up  
I want it all as soon as I can  
Right where I am  
  
Chorus
