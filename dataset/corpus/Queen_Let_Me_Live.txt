Three four  
Ooh  
Take a piece of my heart  
Take a piece of my soul  
Let me live  
Oh yeah  
  
Why don't you take another little piece of my heart  
Why don't you take it and break it  
And tear it all apart  
All I do is give  
And all you do is take  
Baby why don't you give me  
A brand new start  
  
So let me live (So let me live)  
Let me live (Leave me alone)  
Let me live, oh baby  
And make a brand new start  
  
Why don't you take another little piece of my soul  
Why don't you shape it and shake it  
'Til you're really in control  
All you do is take  
And all I do is give  
All that I'm askin'  
Is a chance to live  
  
(So let me live) - So let me live  
(Leave me alone) - Let me live, let me live  
Why don't you let me make a brand new start  
  
Yeah, and it's a long hard struggle, yeah yeah  
But you can always depend on me  
And if you're ever in trouble - hey  
You know where I will be  
  
Why don't you take another little piece of my life  
Why don't you twist it and turn it  
And cut it like a knife  
All you do is live  
All I do is die  
Why can't we just be friends  
Stop livin' a lie  
  
So let me live (So let me live)  
Let me live (Leave me alone)  
Please let me live  
(Why don't you live a little)  
Oh yeah baby  
(Why don't you give a little love...?)  
Go for it baby  
  
Let me live  
Please let me live  
Oh yeah baby, let me live  
And make a brand new start  
Let me live (Let me live)  
Ooh yeah (Let me live)  
Come on (Let me live ooh)  
  
In your heart, oh baby  
(Take another piece, take another piece)  
(Take another piece, take another piece)  
Ooh please let me live  
(Take another piece, take another piece)  
(Take another piece, take another piece)  
Why don't you take another piece  
Take another little piece of my heart  
Oh yeah baby
