Cold Fort Worth beer just ain't no good for jealous  
I tried it night after night  
You're in someone else's arms in Dallas

Darlin', while you're busy burnin' bridges,  
Burn one for me when you get time  
'Cause good memories don't fade so easy  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?  
  
You left me here to be with him in Dallas  
And I know it hurt you at the time  
I wonder now if it makes a difference  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?

Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?  
  
Does Fort Worth ever [Repeats]  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?
