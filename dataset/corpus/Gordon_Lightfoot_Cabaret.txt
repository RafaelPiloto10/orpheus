All I can see is the sea and the sky  
And the sky is blue and the sea is green  
Yesterday's a cabaret  
Gowns of satin on ladies gay  
Yesterday's a cabaret  
Sounds of laughter on faces gray  
Yesterday's a carousel  
Catch the ring and all will be well  
From the coast of California  
Up to the Oregon border  
I've thumbed a thousand miles I guess  
Sitting in a roadside diner  
The big trucks rollin' by  
I don't seem to know at times what's best  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario  
If you're drivin' east to Reno  
Or north to Mendocino  
I hope you find your rainbow?s end  
This highway is my rainbow  
And though I might regret it  
I'm so glad I said it way back when  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario
