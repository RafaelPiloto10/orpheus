Here we are again  
Two lovers lost in a maze  
So many roads we could go down  
So many ways we could go wrong  
  
You think we should part  
Both go our own separate ways  
Oh, girl why can't (oo) we work it out  
Can't you hear what my heart says (ah)  
  
Don't let me be lonely  
Don't let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldn't be right  
Now that i (ah) need you more than ever  
  
Here we are tonight  
Both starring in the same play  
But i'm the one (oo) who plays the fool  
I've only one line to say (ah)  
  
Don't let me be lonely  
Don't let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldn't be right  
Now that i (ah) need you more than ever  
  
Girl, what will i be  
If you walk away from me  
How can i make you stay (ah)  
  
Don't let me be lonely  
Don't let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldn't be right  
Now that i need you more than ever
