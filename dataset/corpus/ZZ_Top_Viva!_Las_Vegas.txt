Y'all still want me to come with you?  
Bright light city gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire  
There's a whole lot of money that's ready to burn  
So get those stakes up higher.  
There's a thousand pretty women just a-waiting out there,  
And they're all livin' devil-may-care.  
I'm just the devil with a love to spare.  
  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
  
Ah, thank-ya very much baby.  
And how I wish that there were more  
Than twenty-four hours in the day.  
But even if there were forty more,  
I wouldn't sleep a minute away.  
Oh, there's blackjack and poker and a roulette wheel.  
A fortune won and lost on every deal.  
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel.  
  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
  
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashin',  
And your one-armed bandits crashin'  
All those hopes down the drain.  
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime,  
Turn the night into daytime,  
If you see it once, you'll never come home again.  
I'm gonna keep on the run,  
I'm gonna have me some fun,  
If it costs me my very last dime.  
  
If I wind up broke,  
Then I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time.  
I'm gonna give it everything I've got.  
Lady Luck please let the dice stay hot.  
Let me shoot a seven with every shot.  
  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva, Viva.
