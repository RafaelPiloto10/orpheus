When the weight of all my dreams  
Is resting heavy on my head  
And the thoughtful words of help and hope  
Have all been nicely said  
But I'm still hurting, wondering if I'll ever be the one  
I think I am--I think I am.  
Then you gently re-remind me  
That You've made me from the first  
And the more I try to be the best  
The more I get the worst.  
And I realize the good in me is only there because of who  
You are, who You are.  
And all I ever have to be is what  
You've made me  
Any more or less would be a step out of Your plan  
As you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind  
That I only have to do what I can find  
And all I ever have to be  
All I have to be  
All I ever have to be is what You've made me
