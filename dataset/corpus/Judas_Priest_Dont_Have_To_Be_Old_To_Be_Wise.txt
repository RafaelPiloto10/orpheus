I've had enough of being programmed  
And told what I ought to do  
Let's get one thing straight  
I'll choose my fate  
And it's got nothing to do with you  
  
The years are flying by and it's time I got high  
Took a sample of the good things in life  
This is a chance  
I'm gonna take  
Gonna kick out trouble and strife  
  
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies  
Might look a little young  
So what's wrong  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
  
No I don't care that the people stare  
Accuse me of going mad  
Just get a long hard look into the mirror  
Then, tell me now who's been had  
  
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em  
Go single all the time's up to me  
So it's off with the ties  
No compromise  
Wanna taste what it's like to be free  
  
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies  
Might look a little young  
So what's wrong  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
  
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies  
Might look a little young  
So what's wrong  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
  
Alright, I'm gonna gather my things  
Go through the door  
Live and let live from now on  
At last a free hand, no longer pre-planned  
I got a will of my own  
  
I go as I please  
Fend for myself  
Pull all the stops, throw the dice  
Out on my own, gonna go it alone  
When I need it  
Then I'll ask for advice  
  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise  
You don't have to be old to be wise
