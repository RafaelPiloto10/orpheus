Break out the whiskey and a bottle of wine  
Take your shirt off bitch, and chop me out a line  
Dim the lights down low, turn up the stereo  
Don't say a word, I already know  
  
You've never done this before, but you feel like tryin', tryin', tryin',
tryin'  
I've done this plenty of times, and I know you're liein', you know I know,  
Hey, hey  
  
You want a shot so I will take aim  
Don't even ask me if I know your name (say my name)  
Don't look so shocked, do not be confused  
I just want to shoot your soul full of rhythm and blues  
  
Them boys been sellin' your lines, but you ain't been buyin', buyin'  
But what I'm givin' is free, so it's well worth tryin'  
  
Because I know you like to rock n roll  
You like to rock n roll  
I'll rock you baby all night long  
Then I gots to roll  
  
Ohhh, ohhh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ohhh, ohhh  
  
There's no one left here we can blame, yeah, yeah, yeah  
It's a lonely walk of shame, I know, but first  
We gonna rock n roll  
Can you feel that, ohh, I can feel it  
I said can you feel that, ohh, I can feel it  
A little lower now, a little lower now  
A little lower now, lower now  
  
there's no one here left  
We can blame  
It's a lonely walk of shame  
I know  
We gonna rock-n-roll  
  
Can you feel that  
Can you feel that  
You used to like to disco  
Now you want to rock n roll  
  
Bus is leavin' baby, we're pullin' out  
Them Austin, Dallas, Houston girls are callin' us out  
Girl dry them eyes, I'm not good at goodbyes  
Tell all your friends I'm that type of guy  
  
That'll bring out the woman that you've been hidin', hidin'  
It's human nature to be what we've all been denyin'  
Baby don't sell tickets to a player that's already playin', playin', playin'  
Just be who you are, but understand what I'm sayin' (what you saying)  
  
That everybody likes to rock n roll, they like to rock n roll  
Rock n roll, they like to rock n roll  
Rock n roll, they like to rock n roll  
Love me baby all night long (rock me baby all night long, yeah, hmm)
