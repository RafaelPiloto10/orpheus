My numbers up  
My time has come  
Sounds like they're playing my song  
On the altar  
My picture  
Will be there while I'm gone  
There'll be time for laughing  
There is no time to cry  
Soon I will be leaving  
Look me in the eye  
No matter what's in front of me  
It's your face that I'll see  
And the future of our young one  
And this is what fuels me  
There's no time for laughing  
There's no time to cry  
Soon I will be leaving  
Look me in the eye  
The oath I took  
Not so seriously  
The worlds gathered steam  
And caught up with me  
And my decisions been made  
Some other place  
By someone I don't know  
And they don't know me  
This is no time for laughing  
There's no time to cry  
Soon I will be leaving  
Look me in the eye
