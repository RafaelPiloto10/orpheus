For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today I turn my blood to sweetest wine  
A holy sign imbued with the divine  
Today's the day the gods walk out on me  
The great divide is crossed for you by me  
For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today the silent one does have her say  
Today all contradictions seemed ok  
Today's the day that I become the sky  
A silent understanding, my, oh my..  
For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today, for once, I'm not the last to learn  
Today the only bridge I have, I burn  
Today's the day the gods walk out on me  
The great divide is crossed for you by me  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
For I am the way.
