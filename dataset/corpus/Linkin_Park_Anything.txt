Ok what is it tonight  
Please just tell me what the hell is wrong  
Do you wanna eat  
Do you wanna sleep  
Do you wanna shout  
Just settle down, settle down, settle down  
  
Well I'll give you candy  
Give you diamonds  
Give you pills  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Just marry me, marry me, marry me  
  
I'm so sick of you tonight  
You never stay awake when I get home  
Is Something wrong with me  
Somethings wrong with you  
I really wish I knew, wish I knew, wish I knew  
  
Well I'll give you candy  
Give you diamonds  
Give you pills  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Because you married me, married me, married me  
  
When I was young I played a game  
That love and happiness were the same  
Now I'm older and I don't play  
And I found out the hardest way  
  
I got wasted  
She got mad  
She called me names then she got her dad  
He got crazy and I did too  
Wond'ring what I did to you  
  
Well I'll give you candy,  
Give you diamonds,  
Give you pills,  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
I'll do anything, anything, anything,  
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything...
