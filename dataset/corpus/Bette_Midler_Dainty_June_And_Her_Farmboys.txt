Extra! Extra!  
Hey, look at  
The headline  
Historical news  
Is being made  
Extra! Extra!  
They're drawing  
A red line  
Around the biggest scoop  
Of the decade  
A barrel of charm  
A fabulous thrill  
The biggest little headline  
In vaudeville  
  
Presenting  
In person  
That 5' 2"  
Bundle of dynamite  
Dainty... June  
[drum roll]  
  
June  
Hello, everybody!  
My name is June!  
What's yours?  
  
[music playing]  
  
I have a moo cow  
A new cow,  
A true cow  
Named Caroline  
  
Louise  
Moo, moo, moo, moo  
  
June  
She's an extra-special  
Friend of mine  
  
Louise  
Moo, moo, moo, moo  
  
June  
I like everything  
About her fine  
  
Louise  
Moo, moo,  
Moo, moo  
  
June  
She likes to moo in  
The moonlight  
When the moody moon  
Appears  
And when she moos in  
The moonlight  
Gosh, it's moosic  
To my ears  
She's so moosical  
She loves a man cow,  
A tan cow  
Who can cow her  
With a glance  
  
Louise  
Moo, moo,  
Moo, moo  
  
June  
When he winks at her  
She starts to dance  
  
Louise  
Moo, moo, moo, moo  
  
June  
It's what grown-ups call  
A real romance  
  
Louise  
Moo, moo, moo, moo  
  
June  
But if we moooved  
To the city  
Or we settled  
By the shore  
She'd make the mooove  
'cause she  
Loves me more  
  
[music ends]  
  
Woman  
Thank you very much.  
That's all.  
  
Rose  
But we have a great finish.  
  
Woman  
I'm sure,  
But mr. Grantziger--  
  
Rose  
Ah... Hit it!  
  
[music playing]  
  
Farmboys  
Broadway  
Broadway  
We miss it so  
We're leaving soon  
And taking June  
To star her in a show  
Bright lights  
White lights  
Rhythm and romance  
The train is late,  
So while we wait  
We're gonna do  
A little dance  
  
June  
Broadway  
Broadway  
How great you are  
I'll leave the farm  
With all its charm  
To be a Broadway star  
Bright lights  
White lights  
Where the neons glow  
My bag is packed,  
I've got my act  
So all aboard,  
C'mon, let's go  
  
Farmboys  
Let's go  
  
[train whistle blowing]  
  
June  
Wait!  
Stop the train.  
Stop the music.  
Stop everything!  
I can't go to Broadway  
With you.  
  
Farboy  
Why not, dainty June?  
  
June  
Because...  
I'm staying here  
With Caroline, my favorite cow!  
  
Farmboys  
Yay!  
Yay!  
  
[playing the stars  
And stripes forever]
