Faster than a bullet  
Terrifying scream  
Enraged and full of anger  
He's half man and half machine  
  
Rides the Metal Monster  
Breathing smoke and fire  
Closing in with vengeance soaring high  
  
He is the Painkiller  
This is the Painkiller  
  
Planets devastated  
Mankind's on its knees  
A saviour comes from out the skies  
In answer to their pleas  
  
Through boiling clouds of thunder  
Blasting bolts of steel  
Evils going under deadly wheels  
  
He is the Painkiller  
This is the Painkiller  
  
Faster than a lazer bullet  
Louder than an atom bomb  
Chromium plated boiling metal  
Brighter than a thousand suns  
  
Flying high on rapture  
Stronger free and brave  
Nevermore encaptured  
They've been brought back from the grave  
  
With mankind resurrected  
Forever to survive  
Returns from Armageddon to the skies  
  
He is the Painkiller  
This is the Painkiller  
Wings of steel Painkiller  
Deadly wheels Painkiller
