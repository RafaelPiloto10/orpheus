Last night in Konya a voice carried me  
To the pulpit of the arrow - did you hear it too?  
The oracle was written on a silver leaf  
Last night I read the words - did you read them too?  
  
Aah  
Precious heart, precious seed, precious life conceived  
In the ring of fire, in the sleep of peace  
Nothing stops desire for the human beat  
  
Last night was a rapture in the mosaic sky  
Dropping shards of love, dropping shards of love  
  
Aah  
Precious heart, precious seed, precious life conceived  
In the ring of fire, in the sleep of peace  
Nothing stops desire for the human beat  
  
I hunger for the cooling flame, I hunger for the infinite game  
  
Last night in Konya a voice carried me  
To the pulpit of the arrow - did you hear it too?  
The oracle was written on a silver leaf  
Last night I read the words - did you read them too?  
  
Devour me, yeah devour me  
  
Oh Precious heart, oh precious seed, oh precious life conceived  
In a ring of fire, in a sleep of peace  
Nothing stops desire for the human beat - the human beat
