Love, hold my hand  
Help me see with the dawn  
That those that have left  
Are not gone  
  
But they carry on  
As stars looking down  
As nature's sons  
And daughters of the heavens  
  
You will not ever be forgotten by me  
In the procession of the mighty stars  
Your name is sung and tattooed now on my heart  
Here I will carry, carry, carry you  
  
Forever  
You have touched my life  
So that now  
Cathedrals of sound are singing, are singing  
  
The waves have come to walk with you  
To where you will live in the land of you,  
Land of you  
You will not ever be forgotten by me  
  
In the procession of the mighty stars  
Your name is sung and tattooed now on my heart  
Here I will carry, carry, carry you  
Here I will carry, carry, carry you  
  
Forever.
