Mirror, mirror  
Up on the wall in the back of the room  
As I walk down the hall in the house where I stayed  
Tell me something about what I saw in the face of a man  
Who once felt it all but feels nothing today  
  
Knock knock  
Who's there  
I don't know, I can't say  
Ask me tomorrow  
I'll tell you the same  
  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now  
  
Trouble trouble  
Down in my hood where it's well understood  
They love when you're bad  
And they hate when you're good  
Tell me something about who we are at the end of our days  
When our souls become one but our lives separate  
  
Knock knock  
Who's there  
I don't know I can't say  
Ask me tomorrow  
I'll tell you the same  
  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now (It's bound to make you smile)  
Ooh, I'm telling you now  
I'm telling you now (It's bound to make you smile)  
  
It's bound to make you smile
