My clothes don't fit and I have no point of view  
I got a bad reputation but I don't believe it's true  
I had something going but I blew it down the can  
Not exactly what I planned  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am  
  
I look like a joker but I feel like a one eyed jack  
Shuffling around never get to the top of the park  
I said to the dealer put the ace in my hand  
But he couldn't give a damn  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am  
  
I sit down thinking bout the things I have to do  
I start out fine then I pick up something new  
Stumbled through the door that's how it all began  
Now it's buried in the sand  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am  
  
The stars shine bright when the boys come out to play  
Never feeling more than I'm feeling right here today  
I used to be fresh but now I'm second hand  
I do what I can  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am
