I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers  
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours  
Then today in the mail I received a short little note  
And I broke down inside at the message that her mother's wrote  
Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again  
We're leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then  
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans  
Goodbye true love goodbye my sweet Mary Ann  
The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then  
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been  
I can't eat I can't sleep for over and over again  
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann  
My Mary Ann died they said she just wasted away  
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today  
For we loved each other and if they had left us alone  
Today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone  
Mary Ann regrets...
