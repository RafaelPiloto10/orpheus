If never I'd met you  
I'd never have seen you cry  
If not for our first hello  
We'd never have to say goodbye  
  
If never I held you  
My feeling's would never show  
It's time I start walkin'  
But there's so much you'll never know  
  
I keep telling you hard luck woman  
You ain't a hard luck woman  
  
Rags, a sailor's only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags, I really love you  
I can't forget about you  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Before I go let me kiss you  
And wipe the tears from your eyes  
I don't wanna hurt you, girl  
You know I could never lie  
  
I keep telling you a hard luck woman  
You ain't a hard luck woman  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Rags, a sailor's only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags, I really love you  
I can't forget about you  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
You'll be a hard luck woman  
Baby, till you find your man  
  
Hard luck woman  
Hard luck woman  
Hard luck woman  
Hard luck woman
