Beneath the moon tonight  
I kneel close to my darling's side,  
Her eyes in death forever closed,  
My sweet and future bride.  
  
Beside some lonely river bank,  
Where the weeping willow grow,  
I'll ease my aching heart tonight,  
Down where the dark waters flow.  
  
I planted on her new made grave  
A tender rose with care,  
To bloom through' all the lonely years  
While she is lying there.  
  
I'll place one tender kiss of love  
Upon that budding rose,  
And bid my world of cares goodbye  
Down where the dark waters flow.
