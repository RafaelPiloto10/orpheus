Verse 1  
If it wasn't for the Lord, where would I be?  
My life was nothing until He set me free.  
What a change He made in my life,  
No more compromising the wrong for the right.  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life.  
  
Chorus  
I don't walk like I used to walk,  
He made the difference.  
I don't talk like I used to talk,  
He made the difference.  
I don't live like I used to live,  
He made the difference.  
I don't give like I used to give,  
He made the difference.  
He made the difference,  
He made the difference in my life.  
  
Verse 2  
He gives me joy that cannot be surpassed,  
I'm on a cloud from the first moment to the last  
He walks with me, talks with me,  
Telling me I'm His own.  
He calms all my fears,  
Telling me I am not alone.  
He made the difference  
He made the difference in my life
