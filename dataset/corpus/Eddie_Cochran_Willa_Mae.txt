Oh Willa Mae, a-come a-shakin' by my way  
Oh Willa Mae, a-come a-shakin' by my way  
You gonna drive me wild  
You know I love you child, Willa Mae  
Oh Willa Mae, I love you more everyday, ooh  
Oh Willa Mae, yeah I love you more everyday  
They say that love is blind, but they did not know your kind  
Oh Willa Mae, you give me chills when we meet  
Like a bulldog walkin' barefoot on a cold-cold street  
Willa Mae, a-come a-shakin' by my way  
You got the love I need, honey yes indeed  
Oh Willa Mae, yeah
