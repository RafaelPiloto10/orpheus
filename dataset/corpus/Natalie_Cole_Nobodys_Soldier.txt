I walked away from you once before  
I still see you standing at the door  
Trying to find the strength to say goodbye to you  
Maybe we were wrong, gotta find what's right for me  
Oh yes, we were brave to go our separate ways  
But these days I wonder who's gonna [Incomprehensible]  
I am nobody?s soldier  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
I am nobody?s soldier  
When my battle is over I?ll be nobody?s soldier  
Life itself is war enough  
I can't win for you, you can't lose for me  
(I can't win for you, you can't lose for me)  
Broken hearts and dreams we left along the way  
Will only give us strength to fight another day  
Maybe I just live too hard and love too much  
But fighting, win or lose  
I?ll be nobody?s soldier  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
(A lonely heart)  
I am nobody?s soldier  
When my battle is over I?ll be nobody?s soldier  
Where do we begin to learn to live again?  
Find a place for me and one day we?ll be free  
When lovers part they leave their broken dreams behind  
And their wounded heart to heal  
Still I am nobody?s soldier  
(Nobody?s soldier)  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
(A lonely heart)  
I am nobody?s soldier  
(Nobody?s soldier)  
When my battle is over I?ll be nobody?s soldier  
No, no, no, no, nobody?s soldier  
(Nobody?s soldier)  
Marching to the rhythm of a lonely heart  
I've got a lonely heart  
Nobody?s soldier  
(Nobody?s soldier)  
Nobody?s soldier  
Nobody?s soldier  
A lonely heart  
Nobody?s soldier
