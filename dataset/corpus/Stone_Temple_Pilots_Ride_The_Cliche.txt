She no wait but she know me  
Intake purge It's my disease  
  
Hold me closer let me be  
Hold me closer let me go away  
Barely know you know my name  
Trip the witch and ride the shame  
  
Just because You're so cliched  
It don't mean You won't get paid  
  
Hold me closer let me be  
Hold me closer let me go away  
Barely know you know my name  
Trip the witch and ride the shame  
  
She no wait but she know me  
Intake purge It's my disease  
  
Hold me closer let me be  
Hold me closer let me go away  
Barely know you know my name  
Trip the witch and ride the shame  
  
No way
