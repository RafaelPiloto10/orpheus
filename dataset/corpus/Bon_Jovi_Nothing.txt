We've been through this all before a thousand times  
Come on, come on, come on, tell me what's on your mind  
Doesn't matter, baby, what I say  
It all amounts to nothing anyway  
  
When push comes to shove, it's never enough  
It always comes down to something  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
(All that's ever left is nothing)  
  
I thought I saw you reach out, thought I saw you try  
Waiting here for something, nothing is all I find  
Kneeling at your altar, standing on the shore  
I'm waiting out, now listen, I'm outside your door  
  
When push comes to shove, it's never enough  
It always comes down to something  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
  
I won't give up  
I won't give up... no  
'Cause you know I won't let you down  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I could learn to live without you but I would die  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
  
I won't give up  
I won't give up... no  
'Cause you know I won't let you down  
You know I won't let you down  
You know I won't let you down
