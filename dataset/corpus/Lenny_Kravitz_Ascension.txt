Brothers and sisters,  
Everythings gonna be alright  
We gonna be together in the moonlight  
No more pain or strife or sorrow  
It's a brand new day  
You don't need no money  
'Cause everything's free  
  
Come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
  
Hey look at that smile  
On that pretty girl's face  
She got no positions,  
But she's poised and has grace  
It's an inner beauty thing baby,  
That shines and shines  
It ain't about your appearance  
But the soul, look inside  
  
So come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
  
Rise up, rise up  
Get up, get up  
Come on, come on  
  
Come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
Come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
To be wild, to be wild,  
To be free to be wide  
Free
