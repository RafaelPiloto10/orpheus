I'm lazy, you know it  
I'm ready for the second show  
Amazin', thing growing  
Just waitin' for the juice to flow  
  
But you're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
Tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul  
  
I'm hurting, I'm wanting  
I'm aching for another go  
You're squirming wet, baby  
Nothin' bad comin' very slow  
And it's burnin' holes in me  
  
You're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
It tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul... whoa-oh  
  
One spastic explosion  
Two pressure-cookers go insane  
It makes me act crazy  
I shiver but I love this game  
  
You're so very ordinary  
You're so very lame  
Tastes like whiskey on your lips  
And earthworms rule your brain
