I just went to the corner  
To get some bread and butter,  
Dad called, he'd got your letter,  
This is his new number.  
Chicken's on the burner  
But wait for me if you can,  
I'll be back soon, honey,  
Big kiss from mommy.  
  
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,  
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,  
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.  
  
Please, I have a son!  
  
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,  
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.  
  
Sorry, I was so late,  
Did you call your dad?  
I hope he was nice to you,  
I don't want to see you sad.  
I see you ate your chicken,  
And saved me a plate,  
I don't know how to tell you, I don't know how to tell,  
But I love you, baby, rememember, I'll always be with you  
I'll always be with you.  
  
I love you, mommy, I love you with all my heart,  
Please, always be with me.  
  
Miss, miss, miss, miss,  
Miss, miss, miss, miss.  
  
Mommy! mommy!  
Why do I love you so if you're just a spec of dust,  
Floating endlessly amongst the trillion stars?  
Knowing that one day we may float apart,  
Meeting each other in universe.
