One time for my freaks  
That know what to do when I  
Skeet, Skeet! That like it  
Hard, rough, face down, ass up  
Yes sir! That like their hair pulled  
When you beat from the back  
That's what I like  
But mami can you really get down like that?  
  
[Chorus]  
She's Freaky! She knows how to do what I like just right!  
She's Freaky! She likes you to talk dirty all night!  
She's Freaky! She likes her ass slapped when she rides!  
She's Freaky! And a freak is what I need in my life!  
  
One, little two, little three, little four  
Five, little six, little seven, little hoes  
Now calling all freaks that like blind folds  
Fi, fi, fo! From go ahead and blow me now  
I need a freak to hold me down!  
I like the way you move  
And the way you do the things you do  
Can I get at you?  
I'm just telling you the truth  
Maybe I'm too blunt, but why front!  
You got it going on, just pull up your skirt  
I know what to do with your thong!  
I'ma Pull it to the side and rub it down right  
Let me know if I'm wrong!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Look at those eyes, look at those thighs  
I could tell by the way she act that  
She's Freaky and knows how to keep secrets  
And knows how to throw it back right!  
Go ahead and hurt me?  
Put it on me, put it on me  
Throw it back like an old jersey  
I want ya'll, I want ya'll  
To get loose, get crunk, get high, get drunk  
To the point of no return, take one more shot  
And feel the burn, now work it out  
Shake that thing 'til you can't no more now!  
Work it out, take that thing d-down to the floor now!  
Work it out, Shake that thing 'til you can't no more now!  
Work it out, take that thing d-down to the floor now!  
  
[Chorus: x2]
