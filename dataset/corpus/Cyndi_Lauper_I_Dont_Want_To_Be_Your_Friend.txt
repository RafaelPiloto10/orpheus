I don't want to see your face  
I don't want to hear your name  
I don't want to thing  
Just stay away baby  
Don't want to know if you're alright  
Or what you're doin' with your life  
Don't want to hear that you'll stay in touch maybe  
  
I'll get just fine  
So if you're goin' then darlin' goodbye, goodbye  
  
Don't call me in the middle of the night no more  
Don't expect me to be there  
Don't think that it will be the way it was before  
I'm not over you yet  
And I don't think I care  
And I don't want to be your friend  
  
I'll forget we ever met  
I'll forget I ever let  
Ever let you into this heart of mine baby  
You just gotta let me be  
You gotta keep away from me  
'Cause all I want to be is just free of you baby  
Don't you come around  
And say you still care about me  
Go now, go now  
  
Don't call me in the middle of the night...  
  
You take it casually, and that's what's killing me  
I'll get by just fine  
So if you're goin' then darlin' goodbye, goodbye  
  
Don't call me in the middle of the night no more  
Don't expect me to be there  
Don't think that it will be the way it was before  
No, no baby  
Don't call me in the middle of the night no more  
I don't want to be your friend  
Don't think that it will be the way it was before  
I don't want to be your friend...
