What's been goin' on  
I've been tryin' to get through to you  
Has it really been that long?  
I've been thinkin' about you baby  
And the way it used to be  
There's so many things I want to say  
But will the words come out all wrong?  
After all that's said and done  
You're still the only one  
  
You're the only one for me  
I'm the only one for you  
Baby can't you see  
You're still the only one  
Each and every night I pray  
Hopin' there'll come a day  
Baby you believe  
You're still the only one  
  
Got to find a way  
To get back inside your heart again  
If I let you walk away  
I'd be dyin' without you baby  
So I just keep holdin' on  
Don't you know we were meant to be  
But then I knew it all along  
After all that we've been through  
You're still the only one  
  
You're the only one for me  
I'm the only one for you  
Baby can't you see  
You're still the only one  
Each and every night I pray  
Hopin' there'll come a day  
Baby you believe  
You're still the only one  
  
And the fire of our love  
Keeps me runnin' back to you  
And no matter where you are  
I will never be that far  
Away  
  
You're the only one for me  
I'm the only one for you  
Baby can't you see  
You're still the only one  
Each and every night I pray  
Hopin' there'll come a day  
Baby you believe  
You're still the only one  
Ain't no need to wonder why  
I'll love you 'till the day I die  
Baby I believe  
You're still the only one  
  
You're the only one  
You're the only one  
You're the only one for me sweet baby  
  
You're the only one  
You're the only one  
You're the only one for me sweet darlin'  
(repeats)  
  
When times are rough and hard  
With you is where I want to be, yeah  
Aw yeah  
  
When I am down and out, oh yeah  
With you is where I'll be  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah yeah baby  
The only one for me  
Me  
Me, yeah
