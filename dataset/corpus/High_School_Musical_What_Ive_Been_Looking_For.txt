Ryan:  
It's hard to believe  
That I couldn't see  
  
Together:  
You were always there beside me  
Thought I was alone  
With no one to hold  
But you were always right beside me  
  
Sharpay:  
This feelings like no other  
  
Together:  
I want you to know  
  
I've never had someone that knows me like you do  
The way you do  
I've never had someone as good for me as you  
No one like you so lonely before i finally found  
What i've been looking for  
  
Sharpay:  
So good to be seen  
So good to be heard  
  
Together:  
Don't have to say a word  
  
Ryan:  
For so long I was lost  
So good to be found  
  
Together:  
I'm loving having you around  
  
Ryan:  
This feeling's like no other  
  
Together:  
I want you to know  
  
I've never had someone that knows me like you do  
The way you do  
I've never had someone as good for me as you  
No one like you  
So lonely before, I finally found  
What I've ben looking for  
  
Together:  
Doo Doo DooDoo

Woa-ah-ah-oh
