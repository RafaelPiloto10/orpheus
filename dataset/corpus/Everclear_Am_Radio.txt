You can hear the music  
Of the AM radio  
  
The VCR and the DVD  
There was none of that crap  
Back in 1970  
We didn't know about a  
World Wide Web  
It was a whole different game  
Playin' back when  
I was a kid  
  
Want to get down in a cool way  
Picture yourself on a beautiful day  
Big bell bottoms and groovy long hair  
Just walkin' in style with a portable CD player  
No you'd listen to the music on the  
  
AM radio AM radio  
Yeah you could hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
  
Flashback, 72  
Another summer in the neighborhood  
Hanging out with nothing to do  
Sometimes we go driving around  
In my sister's pinto  
Cruising with the windows rolled down  
We listen to the radio station  
We were too damn cool  
To buy the eight track tape  
There wasn't any good time  
To want to be inside  
My mama want to watch that TV  
All goddamn night  
  
I'd be in bed with the radio on  
I would listen to it all night long  
Just to hear my favorite song  
You'd have to wait till you could hear it on the  
  
AM radio AM radio  
Yeah you could hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
I can still hear Mama say  
"Boy turn that radio down!"  
  
(Spoken "Aw, Mom. Not that show again! I don't want to watch that show! Can't
we watch Good Times or Chico and the Man or something cool? Turn it off!)  
  
Things changed back in '75  
We were all growing up on the in and the outside  
We got in trouble with the police man  
We got busted getting high in the back of my friend's van  
I remember 1977  
I started going to concerts and I saw the Led Zeppelin  
I got a guitar on Christmas day  
I dreamed that Jimmy Page would come to  
Santa Monica to teach me to play  
Teach me to play  
  
There isn't any place that I need to go  
There isn't anything that I need to know  
That I did not learn on the radio  
  
Everything gets stupid and I just don't know  
Where to find my happy I listen to my music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
You can hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
You can hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
(Spoken- "I like pop, I like soul, I like rock, but I never liked disco. I
like pop, I like soul, I like rock, but I never liked disco. We like pop, we
like soul, we like rock, but we never liked disco")  
  
No never liked disco  
No never liked disco  
No never liked disco  
No never liked disco
