(Original by - Grand Funk Railroad)  
  
I'm in love with a girl  
I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
Let her be somebody else's queen  
I don't want to know about it  
Too many others who know what I mean  
That's why I got to live without it  
Said I'm in love with a girl  
I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl  
I can't live without  
I'm in love  
But I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love  
But I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
The story is coming back to me  
From my friends and the people I don't want to see  
The things they're saying I know just couldn't be true  
At least not until I hear it from you  
Cause I love a little girl  
I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl  
I can't live without  
I'm in love  
But I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love  
But I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
Chorus
