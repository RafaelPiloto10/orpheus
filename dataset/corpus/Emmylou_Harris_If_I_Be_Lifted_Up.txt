(Traditional)  
Down in the valley while on my knees  
I asked my Jesus carry please  
He promised that he'd take care of me  
If I would lift him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
I 'll be your father  
I'll be your mother  
I'll be your sister  
And your brother  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
I'll bring joy, joy, joy  
To your soul  
When I am lonely  
When I am sad  
My Jesus comes and makes me glad  
He is the dearest friend I've have had  
I want to lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
I 'll be your father  
I'll be your mother  
I'll be your sister  
And your brother  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
I'll bring joy, joy, joy  
To your soul
