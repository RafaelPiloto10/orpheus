A broken mirror and razor blade  
She's a politician  
Hot headed all the time  
She's a politician  
  
She doesn't misaccuse  
She doesn't misabuse  
She don't listen, even if she doesn't know what she's saying  
She's a politician  
  
And when it comes to blows  
She'll get you on the ropes  
She's got you beat, you can tell by the company she keeps  
She's a politician  
  
A broken mirror and razor blade  
She's a politician  
Hot headed all the time  
She's a politician  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
She's got you all confused  
With her machine gun talk  
She won't give it cause she knows she's got a lot
