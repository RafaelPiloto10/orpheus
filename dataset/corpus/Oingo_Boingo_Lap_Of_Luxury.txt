I work all day and I work all night 4x  
I work all day and I work all night  
I work so my wife and kids will have a pleasant life  
I work as many jobs as I can  
I'm proud to work I guess I'm just a working man  
-who am I to complain  
I live in the lap of luxury  
I got a car and a big tv that's so fine  
I go to the pictures when I can  
-the pictures take me to far-away lands  
-almost makes me forget who I am  
Sometimes at work I've a fantasy  
That I'm a man who livesa life of mystery  
(but) then the whistle brings me to  
I can't forget why I'm here, I've got a job to do  
-Responsibility- is much more important to a man like me  
I work all day and I work all night  
I work all day and I work all night - etc. etc.  
Guitar solo  
I got a job at the factory  
But I don't mind cause I know that the job is right for me  
I don't complain I'm satisfied  
And I don't care to rub elbows with the wealthy  
They've got their problems too, I don't envy them a bit don't ya know  
I'm doin' what I want and it ain't so bas  
I've got everything that a man could have  
(I'm) living in the lap of luxury - living in the lap of luxury  
Work all day and I work all night  
I work all day and I work all night etc. etc.
