I love you like I want you  
And I kiss you like I need you  
Every night  
I'll draw you close to me  
I'll tell you words of comfort  
It's my delight  
Darling I've grown to love you  
More every day  
And I've got a song to sing  
Each lonely night, oh yeah, oh yeah  
Stronger than the north winds  
Higher than the mountains  
That's my love for you  
And I will never hurt you  
Nor will I forsake you  
Darling be true  
It's only a matter of time, oh yeah  
Then all of my dreams will come true  
In every way, oh yeah oh yeah  
Stronger than the north winds  
Higher than the mountains  
That's my love for you  
And I will never hurt you  
Nor will I forsake you  
Darling be true  
It's only a matter of time, oh yeah  
Then all of my dreams will come true  
In every way, oh yeah oh yeah
