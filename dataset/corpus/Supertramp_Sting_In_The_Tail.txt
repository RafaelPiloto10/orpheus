Well, I don't care  
About the summer rain  
I know it's good for the garden  
Don't care what blue skies  
They turn to gray  
When you come around  
And try to run me down  
Storm clouds darken, yeah  
I don't get down when the fields go brown  
It's just a charm of the season  
Well, things in nature have their reason  
But when you come along and try to do me wrong  
Well, the first time, I'll ignore it  
But don't you push beyond the pale  
But then you're gonna find  
There's no more water in the well  
And you may think you're gonna walk  
Right all well over me  
But there's a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
The wind blows cold as the year grows old  
Yeah, that's just the natural way it goes  
I feel a chill from my head down to my toes  
Each time you call my name and tell me I'm to blame  
Well, the first time, I'll ignore it  
But don't you push beyond the pale  
But then you're gonna find  
There's no more water in the well  
And you may think you're gonna walk  
Right all over me  
But there's a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
I said the first time I'll ignore it  
But don't you push beyond the pale  
And then you're gonna find  
There's no more water in the well  
You may think you're gonna walk  
Right all over me  
There's a sting in the tail  
Of this honey bee  
Yes, there's a sting in the tail  
Well, the cold wind's gonna blow  
Let it rain, let it snow  
And don't give me your grief  
I can't take it anymore
