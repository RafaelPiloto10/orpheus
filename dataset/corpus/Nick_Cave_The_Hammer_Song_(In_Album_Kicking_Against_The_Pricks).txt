(A. Harvey)  
  
Oh please don't send me out  
Said the man with the hammer, hammering the anvil  
I been walking on a road of rocks  
And I keep on hammering, keep on hammering, keep on hammering,  
Hammering the anvil  
  
  
Don't let the sun go down  
Said the man with the fire, firing the furnace  
I been buried in the snow  
And I keep on firing, keep on firing, keep on firing,  
Firing the furnace  
  
  
Oh don't talk to me  
Said the man with the chisel, chiseling the surface  
I been sleeping far too long  
And I keep on chiseling, keep on chiseling, keep on chiseling,  
Chiseling the surface  
  
  
I don't know what you mean  
Said the man with the shovel, shoveling the ashes  
I been digging in the frozen ground  
And I keep on shoveling, keep on shoveling, keep on shoveling,  
Shoveling the ashes  
  
  
Shoveling the ashes  
Chiseling the surface  
Firing the furnace  
Hammering the anvil
