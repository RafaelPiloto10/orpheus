What do you do when you're down and out  
Do you sit and sigh and wonder why  
If the answer just comes right to you  
It's letting you know just what to do  
  
Oh, your lady's tired of you running around  
And if you don't stop she'll put you down  
Says she's got some good to give  
All of her love and affection here  
All you got to do is stop running around  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around  
Tell me, are you tired running around  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired playin' round town  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired gettin' down on the town  
  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
  
Lady says she needs your love  
It just can't come from up above  
She doesn't want to be by herself  
Says she wants you and no one else  
  
Knows you bring home the bread  
That's half the plan, stay and hold her hand  
You being home is surely missed  
All she wants is you to hug and kiss  
  
All you got to do is start stay at home  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around town  
  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired playin' around town, town  
Tell me, are you tired  
Tell me, are you tired gettin' down on the town  
  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home  
Stay at home, stay at home
