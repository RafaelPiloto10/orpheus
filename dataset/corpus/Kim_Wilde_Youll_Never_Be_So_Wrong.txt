Just two lovers in a seedy cafe  
Someone's leaving, the waiter says "Hey, won't you wait"  
Running nowhere, she hides in her room  
What he told her had to get out and soon  
  
It's just a bad affair you've had  
No need to cry, don't take it bad  
You'll soon be glad when you're far apart  
  
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time  
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time  
'Cause I'm never gonna find that feeling again  
I'm never gonna find that feeling again  
  
Now she's breaking but what can she do  
Somewhere out there a car disappears out of view  
Fumbles somewhere for stale cigarettes  
Looks for numbers, the ones she could dial but forgets  
  
No point in you just looking down  
No way that you can turn it around  
You've go to realise you''re free  
  
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time  
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time  
'Cause I'm never gonna find that feeling again  
I'm never gonna find that feeling again  
  
No point in you just looking down  
No way that you can turn it around  
You've go to realise you're free  
  
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time  
You'll never be so wrong, not for a long time  
'Cause I'm never gonna find that feeling again  
I'm never gonna find that feeling again
