It's over and done  
But the heartache lives on inside  
And who is the one  
You're claiming to instead of me tonight  
  
Where are you know  
Now that I need you  
Tears on my pillow  
Wherever you go  
I cry me a river  
That leads to your ocean  
You'll never see me fall apart  
In a words of a broken heart  
  
It's just emotion takin' me over  
Tired of sorrow lost in my soul  
But if you don't come back  
Come home to me darling  
'Cause you know that  
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight  
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight, goodnight  
  
I'm at your side  
A part of all the things you are  
But got a part of someone else  
You go to find your shining star  
  
Where are you know  
Now that I need you  
Tears on my pillow  
Wherever you go  
I cry me a river  
That leads to your ocean  
You'll never see me fall apart  
In a words of a broken heart  
  
It's just emotion takin' me over  
Tired of sorrow lost in my soul  
But if you don't come back  
Come home to me darling  
'Cause you know that  
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight  
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight, goodnight
