Everybody says you let me down  
I should be ashamed to take you 'round  
Makes no difference what you used to do  
Darlin', I could never be ashamed of you  
Maybe you were reckless yesterday  
But together, we can find a brighter way  
In my heart, I know that you'll come through  
Darlin', I could never be ashamed of you  
All the happiness I've ever known  
Came the day you said you'd be my own  
And it matters not what we go through  
Darlin', I could never be ashamed of you  
Maybe you've been cheated in the past  
And perhaps those memories will always last  
Even though you proved to be untrue  
Darlin', I could never be ashamed of you
