I don't drink as much as I used to  
Lately, it just ain't my style  
And hard times don't last like they used to  
They pass quicker, like when I was a child.  
[Chorus:]  
Somehow I've learned how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
And the magic the morning is bringing home  
A song for a life I have found  
It keeps my feet on the ground  
[Solo]  
The midsummer days sit so heavy  
But don't they blow like a breeze through your mind  
When nothing appears in a hurry  
To make up for someone's lost time  
[Chorus]
