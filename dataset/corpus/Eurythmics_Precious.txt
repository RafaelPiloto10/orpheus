I never had a lot of spendin' money  
I never had a lot of change to spare  
But darlin', do you think I worry  
Little darlin', do you think I care  
  
There's a whole lot of things  
In this restless world  
That a whole lot of money can't buy  
You can't get it from your pocketbook  
And I'm gonna tell you why  
  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
  
All the different kinds of teas in China  
All the shiny little gems so rare  
Gold and silver and sparkling diamonds  
Won't ever with your love compare  
  
So take your cares and your troubles  
And send them all away  
And put them back where they all belong  
Forget about them for a day  
  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
  
Because it's precious  
(Precious thing)  
Your love is precious, child  
(Precious thing)  
Because it's precious  
(It's precious)  
Your love is precious, child  
(It's a precious thing)  
  
A little of understanding  
Is gonna change your heart and soul  
It's gonna heal your broken spirit  
So make love your special goal  
  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child  
Because it's precious  
Your love is precious, child
