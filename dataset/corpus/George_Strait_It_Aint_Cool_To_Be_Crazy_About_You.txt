I thought you and me were something special  
Thought you thought that way too  
Now I know that this old boy just ain't the  
Best you'll think you'll ever do  
  
[Chorus]  
It ain't cool to be crazy about you  
It ain't suave or debonair  
To let you know I care  
Like I do  
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart  
(I) Should've known right from the start  
I'd end up like a fool  
Believe me it ain't cool  
  
All of my friends they tried to tell me  
What and what not to do  
It took a while for them to sell me  
But finally they got through  
  
[Chorus]
