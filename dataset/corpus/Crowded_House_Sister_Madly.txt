Now you're heading down to get someone  
Should've done what he had to do years ago  
The position is coming through  
All the people that you're standing on  
All the people that you're standing on  
Now you're heading down to be someone  
Someone that you've seen in a magazine  
Your premonition is coming true  
Oh baby you're not so green  
No baby you're not so green  
No baby you're not so  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
You're systematically stepping on my head  
Now you're heading down to find something  
Something that you buried in your back yard  
The position is coming through  
From all the dirt that you're digging up  
From all the dirt that you're digging up  
Now you're heading down to be somewhere  
Somewhere you imagined in your wildest dream  
The opposition is coming through  
From all the people that you're standing on  
From all the people that you're standing on  
Now you better you'd better take a firm hand  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
You're systematically stepping on my head  
Now you're heading down to get someone  
Someone that you should've had years ago  
The position is coming through  
All the people that you're standing on  
All the people that you're standing on  
You're hard to get a hand on  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
You're systematically stepping on my head
