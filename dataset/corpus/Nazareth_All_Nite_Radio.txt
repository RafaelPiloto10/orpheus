So you've run outa numbers  
And you've run outa lovers  
They won't deliver that pizza  
  
You're hungry under the covers  
You're all alone in the moonlight  
Got to get ready for daylight  
  
All night, all night  
Listening to the all night radio  
  
You could have been sleepin'  
You could have done anythin'  
But everbody's singin'  
Good morin'  
  
All night, all night  
Listening to the all night  
All night radio
