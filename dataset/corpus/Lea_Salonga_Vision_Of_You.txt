Time moves a summer wind  
I can see your face again  
Was it such a tragedy  
Being you, being me?  
  
Smoke clears, the picture fades  
But I stay back in yesterday  
All the strangers come and go  
All of them will never know  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody's touch feels like your touch  
Nobody gets to me that much  
Nobody's kiss moves me inside  
And I have no place left to hide  
Tell me what can I do?  
I have a vision of you  
Tell me what can I do  
With this vision of you?  
  
Did I walk? Did you run?  
What's the way to love someone?  
Oh, my darling, did we know  
What it meant when we let go?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With this vision of you?  
  
How can a candle ever burn so bright?  
Casting a shadow on my life  
I am blinded by your light  
Even without you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With this vision of you?  
Tell me what can I do  
I have a vision of you  
Tell me what can I do  
With this vision of you?
