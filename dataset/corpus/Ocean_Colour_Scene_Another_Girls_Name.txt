Go take your bags away  
Get out of my home  
Get out of my life  
I don't want you hanging round  
And I don't want you to be my wife  
When I go to the cafe  
I sit in the seat that faces the mirror  
I look at my face today  
And I look such a wreck today  
I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
O-oh no way, Jose  
I don't ??? ugly views  
And I'm not interested in family muse  
And ?? is boring and conversation pours  
Even when we're in bed  
I wanna rearrange your head  
Put down the covers  
And get you up against the wall  
Shoot good babe  
Well I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
O-oh no way, Jose  
You follow where it's going  
Can't you see I was breaking  
How'd you know the love making wasn't only faking  
You get out of my home  
And you get out of my life  
You didn't hang around much girl  
'Cause now you're someone else's wife  
I go to the cafe  
And I sit in the seat that faces the mirror  
Well I look at my face today  
And I look so good today  
Well I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
O-oh no way, oh no way, oh no way, Jose  
You're just another girls names  
O-oh you're just another girls name (X3)
