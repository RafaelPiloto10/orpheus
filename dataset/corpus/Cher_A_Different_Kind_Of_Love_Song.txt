What if the world was crazy and I was sane  
Would it be so strange  
I can't believe that I am alone in saying  
The things I'm saying  
I am a part of you  
  
These are universal truths  
We're all part of the light that flows through everything  
This is a different kind of love song  
Dedicated to everyone  
Different kind of love song-oh,oh  
What if the world calmed down and we could all breath  
Together easily  
Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me  
And everything in between  
I am part of you  
  
We have living proof  
There is some kind of light that flows through everything  
This is a different kind of love song  
Dedicated to everyone  
Different kind of love song-oh,oh  
This is a different kind of love song  
A higher plane we can flow on  
Different kind of love song-oh,oh
