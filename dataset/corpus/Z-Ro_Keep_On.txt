Say some people call me the Crooked, cause my mind ain't straight  
Leave niggaz leaning to the side, like they need a V8  
I tried to be a changed man, but my plan ain't play  
Haters forced me, to put a gun back in my hand and spray  
Was already dealing with, a bunch of those hoe ass niggaz  
Niggaz-niggaz, hated by mo' bitch ass niggaz  
Took a fall, got arrested then you bitches got bold  
What you thought I wasn't coming back, to bomb on you hoes  
I heard the rumors for myself, Z-Ro signed for ten  
Here I am, it ain't safe to come outside again  
For the record, fuck everybody I ain't got no friend  
Nigga remember how you treated Ro, when Ro had no ends  
That explain when you see me, why I reach in my pants  
Pull out my pistol, let a fade nigga straight bleed in they ass  
Yeah I'm back and let it be known, Z-Ro done made it home  
Fuck with me I empty out my clip, reload and keep on  
  
[Hook: x2]  
Keep on, and I won't stop  
Fuck with me, I promise I'ma make your breathing stop  
I keep on, with my glock cocked  
Living on the edge till I'm dead, screaming fuck the cops  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
Fresh out of jail, mayn  
You niggaz, done fucked up now  
Came back, to get my mail mayn  
Playa don't make me, buck you down  
I'm the King of Da Ghetto  
And I'm here, to reclaim my throne  
In a relationship, with a chick 4-4  
And nigga my bitch, be blazing domes  
If y'all fellas, wanna play game  
I'm dumping, on every car I see  
It's that time, when I play mayn  
Brace yourself, R.I.P.  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
It's reprocussions, when you niggaz press my buttons too hard  
Then I become a saint, by bringing you niggaz closer to God  
Love nothing and slug something, everytime I breathe  
Murder on my enemies, I'm the reason they families grieve  
Please O.G. gorilla, original girl gone on  
'Fore I beat your bitch ass, without ever hanging up my phone  
Cause when I get wired up, niggaz get tied up  
It be nothing but yellow tape, everytime I r-ride up  
T-Ray, we use to be cool and kick it and thang  
Understand you was in prison, and missing the game  
Understand me when I tell you, if you cross me you could die  
Might as well be a pigeon, cause your spirit fin to fly  
If you wasn't on "Keep on Watching Me", you ain't a Guerilla  
Trying to imitate a gangsta, that's when a gangsta come get ya  
Run and telling toy soldiers in your army, the war's on  
Catch em one by one and dump my gun, they cease to keep on what
