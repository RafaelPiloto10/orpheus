It seems you're feeling down  
You don't know how long  
But you know you don't like it  
Lost in your room  
  
It seems you're feeling tired  
You don't know what from  
One too many parties  
Makeup hides the wounds  
  
[Chorus]  
Answer me  
Giving up won't get you out  
Can't you hear me  
Come and leave this room of doubt  
Answer me  
  
It seems you're feeling scared  
You don't know how come  
Hiding in the shadows  
Praying for the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It seems you're feeling old  
You don't know how long  
Holding on to memories  
Waiting for the song  
  
[Chorus]
