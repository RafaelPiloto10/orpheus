I see her as a little girl  
Hiding in her room  
She takes another bath  
And she sprays her mama's perfume  
To try to wipe away  
The scent he left behind  
But it haunts her mind  
  
You see, she's his little rag  
Nothing more than just a waif  
And he's mopping up his need  
She is tired and afraid  
Maybe she'll find a way  
Through these awful years  
To disappear  
  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven  
I see no mercy, and no one down here's naming names  
Nobody's naming names  
  
Now, she's looking in the mirror  
At a lovely woman face  
No more frightened little girl  
Like she's gone without a trace  
Still she leaves the light  
Burning in the hall  
It's hard to sleep at all  
  
'Til she crawls up in her bed  
Acting quiet as a mouse  
Deep inside, she's listening  
For a creaking in the house  
But no one's left to harm her  
She's fin'ly safe and sound  
There's a peace she has found  
  
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again  
She's coming to life again  
  
He's in the middle of her pain, in the middle of her shame  
Mercy brings life  
He's in the middle  
Mercy in the middle  
  
So ask me how I know  
Ask me how I know  
  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again  
  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again
