You imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your  
motor to me  
You're a burner yeah, a real motor car  
You say you want your order filled  
Made me shiver when I  
put it in  
Pumping just won't do, you know, lucky for  
you  
  
Who'd ever thought you'd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
You  
made my drive shaft crank  
You made my pistons bulge  
You made my ball bearings melt from the heat  
Oh yeah  
yeah  
  
We were shifting this hard when we took off  
Put tonight all four on the floor  
When we hit top then  
you know it feels so slow  
You say you want your order  
filled  
Made me shiver when I put it in  
Pumping just  
won't do, you know, lucky for you  
  
Who'd  
ever thought you'd be better  
At turning a screw than  
me  
I do it for my life  
You made my drive shaft  
crank  
You made my pistons bulge  
You made my ball  
bearings melt from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
I'm giving you my room service  
And you know  
it's more than enough  
When you spark my plug you know  
I'm in love  
You imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your motor to me  
With all four on the  
floor I feel what's in store  
  
Who'd ever  
thought you'd be better  
At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
You made my drive shaft crank  
You made my pistons bulge  
You made my ball bearings melt  
from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah
