Call her Ruth  
'Cause she knows the price  
Call her Sandy  
'Cause heart is like ice  
You can call her  
Whatever you wish  
Nothing can change  
The person she is  
  
Call her Maria  
Her real name's Eve  
Try not to slam the door  
Or you'll wake her as you leave  
You can tell by  
The pictures on her wall  
That she never really  
Knew you at all  
  
Everywhere I look  
It's just looking into waste  
I can't see any courage  
Or hope in your face  
You say there's no point  
Of searching anymore  
'Cause whatever I find  
I'll have found before  
  
I must be looking  
For something fantastic!  
And all this reality  
It's such a test  
You take what you're given  
And I'll take my time  
You in your small corner  
And I in mine
