Make money money, make money money money, make money money, make money money

[Chorus]  
I'm like ha ha ha ha ha you niggas make me laugh,

Well I cant take being broke

[Verse: Fabolous]  
You niggas are comical, who me  
I'm seven digits two comical on my mama fool  
I'm getting this money and that kill'em  
They looking at a pimp funny I'm Katt Williams  
Money mike, I gets money on the mic  
And some say I'm wild'n out  
Bacardi styling out, pushing seven digits dialing  
But I ain't gotta fucking choice  
My money talks in a Chris Tucker voice  
"and you know this man"  
You a stand up rapper, hip hop comedian  
I start laughing as soon as I put your cd in  
You joke, you joke, you kid, you kid  
Should have went to comedy central with the vids you did  
But OK, you b.e.t. only if its comic view  
Promise you I'm funny style I can be a comic too  
I'm Marty Mar, at a auty mar  
Cute snotty broad, tits like dolly par  
Ed harty naw this is carty ma  
But that was a good one, hardy har  
Lambo Galardi car getting my last laugh haw  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse: Pusha t's]  
The jokes on you niggas  
See the figures don't add up to the claims  
You Sam Kinnison you just screaming names  
My brother my partner for real like the wayans  
Plus everything in live in living color  
High rise checks diamonds the size of Robin Harris'  
I Bebe kids my neck  
You call it a tribute, a proof that I distribute  
Sales was slow I got Paco to contribute  
Some morals in each state, move weight, get caught, don't talk, Dave Chappelle
niggas might break  
So hilarious, how the chariots, carry us  
Phantom is light gray sort of like ashy Larry is  
King of the one liner lil' rhymers watch what you say  
You just a potty mouth like Andrew dice clay  
I pop collars on niggas, I drop dollars on niggas  
I jell o's together I bill Cosby on niggas  
Got you lost in the smoke I Micheal Connelly you niggas  
I watch u verse from the fire I Richard Pryor you niggas  
Said enough nigga sort of like Kramer  
I'm joking you don't wanna see the anger Fab tell'em  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
Mane look, the diamonds in your chain look  
Funnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi  
I am to fly, in the booth I  
Make joke of them, I ain't the richest nigga but I ain't broke as them  
I'm serious, petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph  
Girls get curious  
Is he really funny, don't be silly honey  
I'm the burner packing  
Bernie macing  
I ain't scared of you ma-fuckers kick ass  
Hon stack thick ass  
A deck of card v.i.p. section hard  
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads  
I'm popping rose, I don't the neck to god  
Don't front yo, I be in the front row  
Watch your wise cracks or I'll be at your front door  
And I push up on a female smoothly, in a GL but keep that on the D.L. Hughley  
Lol this is Los  
Oh no your money coming so slow guess this ma-fuckers a no show, oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]
