Jesus Christ, Fanny Brice,  
Wolfie Mozart and Humphrey Bogart and  
Genghis Khan and  
On to H. G. Wells.  
  
Ho Chi Minh, Gunga Din  
Henry Luce and John Wilkes Booth  
And Alexander's  
King and Graham Bell.  
  
Ramar Krishna, Mama Whistler,  
Patrice Lumumba and Russ Colombo,  
Karl and Chico Marx,  
Albert Camus.  
  
E. A. Poe, Henri Rousseau,  
Sholom Aleichem and Caryl Chessman,  
Alan Freed and  
Buster Keaton too  
  
And each one there  
Has one thing shared:  
They have sweated beneath the same sun,  
Looked up in wonder at the same moon,  
And wept when it was all done  
  
For being? Done too soon,  
For being? Done too soon.  
For being? Done.
