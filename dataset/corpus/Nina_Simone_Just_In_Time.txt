Let's go  
Just in time you've found me just in time  
Before you came my time was running low  
I was lost the losing dice were tossed  
  
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go  
Now you hear now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt of fear I've found my way  
For love came just in time you've found me just in time  
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day  
  
Just in time  
Before you came my time was running low oh baby  
I was lost the losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all crossed nowhere to go  
Now you hear now I know just where I'm going  
  
No more doubt of fear I've found my way  
For love came just in time you've found me just in time  
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights  
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights  
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day
