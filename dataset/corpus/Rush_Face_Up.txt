You turn my head  
I spin my wheels  
Running on empty  
You know how that feels  
  
I'm on a roll now  
Or is it a slide?  
Can't be too careful  
With that dangerous pride  
If I could only reach that dial inside  
And turn it up  
  
Face up or you can only back down  
Face up hit the target, or you better hit the ground  
Face up there's still time to turn the game around  
Face up turn it up or turn that wild card down  
Turn it up  
  
Don't complain  
Don't explain  
I don't think my new resolve  
Can stand the strain  
  
I'm in a groove now  
Or is it a rut?  
I need some feedback  
But all the lines are cut  
I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut  
And turn it up  
  
You get all squeezed up inside  
Like the days were carved in stone  
You get all wired up inside  
And it's bad to be alone  
  
You can go out, you can take a ride  
And when you get out on your own  
You get all smoothed out inside  
And it's good to be alone  
Turn it up
