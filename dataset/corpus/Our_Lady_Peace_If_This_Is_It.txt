I could be your greatest accident  
I could be the blood on your fingertips  
Nothing's wrong  
Nothing to regret  
Just want to breathe you in  
  
If this is it  
  
I could be your greatest confidant  
And I could be the head laying on your breast  
Just want to breathe you in  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The light, the love, the hope is near  
The weight we're under disappears  
If this is it  
  
I could be your greatest accident  
  
[Chorus: x2]
