Say I  
(I)  
Say I  
(I)  
  
If you wanna a brand new shiny car, say I  
If you're sick of songs about broken hearts, say I  
If you spent some nights parkin' at the noon  
If you don't like being told what to do  
  
Say I  
(I)  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
(I)  
I'm gonna keep rockin' until I'm dead and gone  
  
If you turn up the radio too loud, say I  
If make the tilt the world spin round, say I  
If you love a lil' more to spend the cash  
But you hate takin' out the Tuesday trash  
  
Say I  
(I)  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
(I)  
I'm gonna keep rockin' until I'm dead and gone  
  
Worry ain't worth half the time it takes  
I don't wanna think about a thing  
  
Say I  
(I)  
Say I  
(I)  
  
If you hate when a friend goes Hollywood, say I  
Sometimes feel like gettin' nothin' no good, say I  
If you think you're wrong but you know you're right  
You won't back down without a fight  
  
Say I  
(I)  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
(I)  
I'm gonna keep rockin' until I'm dead and gone  
Say I, say I  
  
Oh, say I  
(I)  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
(I)  
I'm gonna keep rockin' until I'm dead and gone  
  
Say I  
(I, I)  
Say I  
(I)  
  
Say I  
(I, I)  
Say I  
(I)  
  
I  
(I, I)  
Say I  
(I)  
  
Say I, say I  
Say I, I  
(I)
