You never known anyone else but me and now you're free whatcha gonna do  
When you're alone and you fall down and I'm not around whatcha gonna do  
And when you reach out for me and find that I ain't there  
And nobody cares whatcha gonna do  
Just think of the lonely road ahead it goes bad whatcha gonna do  
Think about all we've almost had make it sad whatcha gonna do  
How will you make it through the night when you're all alone  
You'll remember me and all those good times that we've known  
Who will you lean on whatcha gonna do  
[ trumpet ]  
How will you make it through the night...  
Who will you lean on whatcha gonna do  
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do
