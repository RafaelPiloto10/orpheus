It enters your veins  
It enters your soul  
Tries to obsess you  
It looks for defaults  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
  
It tries to destroy you  
It tries to tear you down  
Am I lost,  
Lost in your backyard?  
Feel the pain  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
  
It enters your veins  
it enters your soul  
Tries to obsess you  
it looks for defaults  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
Try not to lose, not to lose control  
  
It tries to destroy you  
It tries to tear you down  
Am I lost,  
Lost in your backyard?  
Feel the pain  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
Yellow takes over  
  
Try not to lose, not to lose control
