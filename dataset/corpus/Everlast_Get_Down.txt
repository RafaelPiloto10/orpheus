I see everybody rockin' the same old style  
And everyone's sportin' the same profile  
And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands  
I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams  
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands  
I rock mikes and roll bikes, I cross foreign lands  
I made my bones out in zones where twilight be  
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three  
For every emcee that wannaa test and try  
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly  
Make it up in gold chains what you're lackin' for brains  
It's time to call your ma, duke, scoop up your remains  
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed  
Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin'  
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
While every rapper that's simmed is pimped like a whore  
You see the talk is eighteen, three quarters past four  
When your doctor slaps my ass, hear the lion roar  
The record sales soared and the world got toured  
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored  
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I praise the Lord  
Find me breakin' up your crews, catch me singin' the blues  
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King  
It's Abdul Rakim, now watch me do my thing  
CHORUS  
Down, down, you go  
Down, down, so low  
Down, down, till you hit the floor  
Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more  
You go point blank range with the scope he's knockin'  
The Psycho might change but there ain't no stoppin'  
The mmon's on the rise when the sun start droppin'  
And y'all need to quit the bullshit that you be poppin'  
'Cause I've been hip hoppin' since BDP  
(???), it's Abdul Rakim  
And when referring to me you must respect the name  
Make a quick double take and double check your game  
'Cause you about to get dissed, I'm checkin' my list  
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' dice  
I hit four, five, six, I'm all up in your mix  
I rock good from Hollywood to the city of bricks  
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real  
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal  
You be breakin' your vows like people worshippin' cows  
And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's  
Like Vinny Barbarino, Matt Pachino  
I'm with my man Rino with the Brooklyn Lordz  
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole  
I take it back to the future from the days of old  
I'm too cold to hold, too hot not to burn ya  
Don't stick your nose in businessthat don't concern ya  
Might have to trip and flip like I've Turner  
You too old for schoolin', boy, when I'm gonna learn ya  
CHORUS
