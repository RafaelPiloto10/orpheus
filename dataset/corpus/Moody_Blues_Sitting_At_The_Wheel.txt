I can hear the music playing  
I can hear the word that you're saying  
I can see the love life in your eyes  
What's the use in looking for an answer  
I might find out  
It could be a disaster  
Hold on to your own time  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry  
  
I can see your face on a piece of tomorrow  
I'll hang my dream on a road I can follow  
I gotta touch the warmth of your love  
(Need the warmth of your love, not gonna)  
Not gonna take a chance a  
Change of direction  
Gonna keep on rolling till I find the connection  
Hold on to your lifeline  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry  
I'm sitting at  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
  
Like a voyeur standing at the edge of time  
Looking for a reason  
That's got no rhyme  
Love took a corner  
Shot off for a mile  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Rock on...Rocker  
  
I can feel the music playing (Hold on)  
I can hear the word that you're saying (Hold on)  
I can see the love life in your eyes  
Ain't no use in looking for an answer (Hold on)  
I might find out  
That it could be a disaster (Hold on)  
Hold on to your own time  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry  
I'm sitting at  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry (Oh)  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, rock and roll on by  
Sitting at the wheel (sitting, sitting, sitting)  
I'm just sitting  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll by  
Rock and roll by  
Sitting at the wheel  
  
I'm just sitting  
Sitting at the wheel  
  
If you're sitting at the wheel  
Watch this rocker roll by
