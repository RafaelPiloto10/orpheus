They say everything can be replaced  
Well then distance is not near  
I remember every face  
Of everyone who put me here  
  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
They say everyone needs protection  
They say everyone must fall  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some where so high above this wall  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd  
Is a man who swears hes not to blame  
All day long I hear him shout so loud  
That he swears he was framed  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released
