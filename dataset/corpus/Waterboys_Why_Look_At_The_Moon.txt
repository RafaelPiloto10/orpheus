Willows were swaying  
The water was rippling  
The froggies were singing  
  
Along with the laughing at the bank  
We have the moon to thank  
For this lovely scene we might never have seen  
If it hadn't been for the moon  
  
Why look at that moon?  
  
Away up high, seeing everything  
That goes by, why look at that moon  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
  
Sitting in the desert  
Beneath a lonesome sky  
Cool, my oh my, it would be  
  
If it never have been above  
That fateful little boy  
That one who has beheld  
True love through history  
  
Why must it start?  
Why must the lovers part?  
And why does the cheatin' go on?  
Why have hearts turned to stone?  
  
Why look at that moon?  
  
Away up high, seeing everything  
That goes by, why look at that moon  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
  
Why look at that moon?  
Ain't it grand?  
Why look at that moon?  
Helps me understand  
  
Why look at that moon?  
Inspirator of many a dream  
Why look at that moon?
