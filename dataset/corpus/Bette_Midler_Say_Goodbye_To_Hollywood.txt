Bobby's driving through the city tonight,  
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car.  
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine.  
It's a scene down on sunset boulevard.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Johnny's taking care of things for a while,  
And his style is so right for troubadours.  
They caught him standing with his face to the door,  
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Moving on is a chance that you take  
Anytime you try to stay together.  
Whoa-oa-ho-ho-hoo.  
Say a word out of line  
And you find the friends you had are gone forever, forever.  
So many faces in and out of my life.  
Some will last,  
Some will just be now and then.  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes.  
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye to hollywood.  
Say goodbye, my baby.  
Yeah, say goodbye.  
Yeah, say goodbye.  
Yeah, he's gotta say goodbye.  
He's gotta say goodbye.  
He's gotta say goodbye.  
Say goodbye.  
Yeah, say goodbye,  
Say goodbye, say goodbye.  
You gotta say goodbye.  
Say goodbye, say good bye, say goodbye . . .
