Boom boom clap  
Boom de clap de clap  
Thats right! boom de clap de clap  
Boom boom clap  
Boom de clap de clap  
One! Two! Three! everybody  
C'mon off your seats!  
I'm gonna tell ya 'bout a beat  
That's gonna make ya move your feet.  
  
Ill give the barbecue,  
Show and tell you how to move  
If you're five or eighty two  
This is somethin' you can do!  
  
Pop it, lock it,  
Polka dot it  
Countrify then hip hop it.  
Put your hawk in the sky  
Side to side  
Jump to the left  
Stick it, glide.  
Zig zag cross the floor  
Shuffle in diagonal  
When the drum hits,  
Hands on your hips  
One foot it, 180 twist  
And then a, zig zag,  
Step, slide  
Lean it left,  
Clap three times  
Shake it out  
Head to toe  
Throw it all together  
That's how we roll  
  
[Chorus]  
Do the hoedown (throwdown)  
Do the hoedown (throwdown)  
Do the hoedown (throwdown)  
Throw it all together  
That's how we roll  
  
We get to four, five, six  
And you're feelin' busted  
But it's not time to quit  
Practice makes you perfect  
  
Pop it, lock it,  
Polka dot it  
Countrify then hip hop it.  
Put your hawk in the sky  
Side to side  
Jump to the left  
Stick it, glide.  
Zig zag cross the floor  
Shuffle in diagonal  
When the drum hits,  
Hands on your hips  
One foot it, 180 twist  
And then a, zig zag,  
Step, slide  
Lean it left,  
Clap three times  
Shake it out  
Head to toe  
Throw it all together  
That's how we roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boom de clap de clap  
Boom boom clap  
C'mon, here we go  
Boom boom clap  
Boom de clap de clap  
Boom boom clap  
Boom de clap  
  
Pop it, lock it,  
Polka dot it  
Countrify then hip hop it.  
Put your hawk in the sky  
Side to side  
Jump to the left  
Stick it, glide.  
Zig zag cross the floor  
Shuffle in diagonal  
When the drum hits,  
Hands on your hips  
One foot it, 180 twist  
And then a, zig zag,  
Step, slide  
Lean it left,  
Clap three times  
Shake it out  
Head to toe  
Throw it all together  
That's how we roll  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Boom dap clap  
Ba boom da clap clap clap  
Boom dap clap  
Ba boom da clap clap  
Boom de clap  
Boom de clap de clap  
  
Throw it all together  
That's how we roll!
