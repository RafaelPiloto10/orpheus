Can you see now where I stand, my friend  
Will you offer me your helping hand  
And will you cross the void and speak your little words  
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts  
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts  
  
I'm standing back against the wall  
Dare I to move I got to fall  
My heart is blinded by the light  
I close my eyes forever  
  
May not turn left, may not turn right  
I sense a gap to every side  
I'm standing back against the wall  
Back against the wall  
  
Get back!  
Get back!  
  
I can hear it coming closer now  
Blaring silence of the dark below  
Under my feet I feel it slide like sand  
A frequent crushing down again, again, again and again  
  
I'm standing back against the wall  
Dare I to move I got to fall  
My heart is blinded by the light  
I close my eyes forever  
  
May not turn left, may not turn right  
I sense a gap to every side  
I'm standing back against the wall  
Back against the wall  
  
Will you cross the void of pride  
Then speak the words  
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts  
It hurts, it hurts, yes it hurts  
  
I'm standing back against the wall  
Dare I to move I got to fall  
My heart is blinded by the light  
I close my eyes forever  
  
May not turn left, may not turn right  
I sense a gap to every side  
I'm standing back against the wall  
Back against the wall  
  
Get back!  
Back against the wall  
Get back!  
Back against the wall
