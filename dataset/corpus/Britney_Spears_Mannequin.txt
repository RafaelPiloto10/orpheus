Always talking around this,  
He wants me,  
I get things, everything I wanted,  
My own way, your time, goldmines,  
Loose guys, on my backless, dresses, exes.  
  
I cannot help myself, I'm just doing what I do,  
Got my heart set, do anything that I want so thank you,  
I like it and I do what I like,  
And if you do what I like, then you'll like it,  
  
If you wanna just  
Scream,  
Scream your lungs out,  
If you wanna just  
Cry,  
Cry your eyes out,  
I'm not doing that  
  
That's what I'm about.  
  
[Chorus]  
You can cry your eyes out of your head,  
Baby, baby,  
I don't care, I don't care,  
I don't care, I don't care,  
You can cry-cry-cry again-gain-gain,  
My face like a mannequin,  
(Scream)  
Mannequin, yea I did,  
It again and again,  
You can cry-cry-cry again-gain-gain,  
My face like a mannequin.  
  
You told me more than he did,  
And then you were frozen, imposin',  
There's no way you want me,  
Watch me, trust me,  
Can't impress me,  
I'm not changing, I'm just  
  
I cannot help myself, I'm just doing what I do,  
Got my heart set, do anything that I want so thank you,  
I like it and I do what I like,  
And if you do what I like, then you'll like it,  
  
If you wanna just  
Scream,  
Scream your lungs out,  
If you wanna just  
Cry,  
Cry your eyes out,  
I'm not doing that  
  
That's what I'm about.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
  
Watch me,  
(Watch me, watch me, watch me,  
Watch me, watch me, watch me,  
Watch me, watch me, watch me,  
Watch me, watch me, watch me,  
Watch me, watch me)  
  
If you wanna just  
Scream,  
Scream your lungs out,  
If you wanna just  
Cry,  
Cry your eyes out,  
(I'm not doing that)  
  
That's what I'm about.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.  
My face like a mannequin.
