Woman trouble always in my life  
Got a babe, but she'll never be my wife  
'Cause I know, yes, I know  
When she got you, man, you're never letting go  
  
You see her in the street with the sparkling eyes  
Don't forget that she knows how to cry  
'Cause you know, yes, I know  
When she got you, man, you're never letting go  
  
She says, baby, that we'll never fight  
I know I'm gonna treat you right  
You won't be lonely, this I know  
There's a time when women have got to go  
  
Woman trouble always on my mind  
My kind of woman I'll never find  
'Cause I know, yes, I know  
When she got you, man, you'll never let go  
  
Woman trouble always in my life  
Got a babe, but she'll never be my wife  
'Cause I know, yes, I know  
When they got you, man, they're never letting go
