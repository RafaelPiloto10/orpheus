Set alight in purgatory  
Tormented moans of pain  
Piercing dark analogies  
Spat out in full disdain  
  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
  
Diabolus awaits you  
Tearing the flesh from bone  
Slicing edge of sharpened steel  
Terror to call your own  
  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
  
Earth cracks asunder  
Sharpens the bass to point  
Echoes summoning are'lyeh  
To agony anoint  
  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
War against Christ
