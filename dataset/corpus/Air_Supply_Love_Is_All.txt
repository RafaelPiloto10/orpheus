When we come into this world  
And we hunger for the touch  
From the one that brought us life  
From the one that gave so much  
  
Innocence will take your hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind  
  
Don't you know that love is all  
Love is where we all begin  
And when we knock on heaven's door  
Only love will let us in  
  
And as we gather to ourselves  
A part of everything we see  
We realize that what we own  
Isn't what we really need  
  
Innocence take my hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind  
  
Don't you know that love is all  
Love is where we all begin  
Love is all that we must do  
It is the reason why we live  
Love is all I have for you  
  
True love cannot be broken  
Through all the tears of pain  
Only one truth survives,  
Only one truth remains
