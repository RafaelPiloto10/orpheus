You and your baby had some words today  
Till not another word was left to say  
I see that grin boy  
Maybe you think you'll win boy  
Until the sun goes down and once again boy  
  
One lonely night  
One lonely night  
That's all it takes to completely break you  
  
They say it's darkest right before the dawn  
But, oh, those darkest hours can be so long  
You're feeling strong boy  
Tellin yourself she's wrong boy  
But how much longer can this night go on boy  
  
One lonely night  
One lonely night  
That's all it takes to completely break you  
  
One lonely night  
One lonely night  
That's all it takes to completely break you  
  
Oooh, she's such a good find  
Have you gone and lost your mind  
You should know she's one of a kind  
  
Oooh, she's such a good find  
Have you gone and lost your mind  
You should know she's one of a kind  
  
Just one lonely night  
One lonely night  
That's all it takes to completely break you
