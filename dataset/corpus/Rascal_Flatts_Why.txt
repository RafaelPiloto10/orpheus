You must've a been in a place so dark, couldn't feel the light  
Reachin' for you through that stormy cloud  
Now here we are gathered in our little home town  
This can't be the way you meant to draw a crowd  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh why, that's what I keep askin'  
Was there anything I could have said or done  
Oh I, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, God only knows  
What went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song  
  
Now in my mind I keep you frozen as a seventeen year old  
Roundin' third to score that winning run  
You always played with passion no matter what the game  
When you took the stage you shined just like the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Now the oak trees are swayin' in the early autumn breeze  
The golden sun is shining on my face  
The tangled thoughts I hear a mockingbird sing  
This old world really ain't that bad a place  
  
Oh why there's no comprehending  
And who am I to try to judge or explain  
Oh, but I do have one burning question  
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight  
They were wrong  
They lied  
And now you're gone  
And we cried  
  
'Cause It's not like you, to walk away in the middle of a song  
  
Your beautiful song  
Your absolutely beautiful song
