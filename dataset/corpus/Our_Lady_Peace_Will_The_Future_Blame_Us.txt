Are you disappointed,  
And have we destroyed it?  
I, well I've been stumbling down this long and winding road  
And these times are changing,  
And it's complicated,  
I, well I don't want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
And I, don't ask why, anymore  
And I, don't ask why, anymore  
Anymore  
  
Is it getting better,  
And can we live forever?  
I, and I'm not sure what the hell we're fighting for  
Does the money make us,  
And will the future blame us?  
I, oh, I don't want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're tired and alone,  
And you feel like letting go,  
Come home  
When you can't take anymore,  
When you're beat up and ignored,  
Come home  
  
The son is headed home  
The pastor you don't know  
You're a long, long way from home  
There are things you need to know,  
The answers leave you cold  
You're a long, long way from home  
The summer's coming back,  
And it brings a second chance  
If you're not part of this,  
Then I don't want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're tired and alone,  
And you feel like letting go,  
Come home  
When you can't take anymore,  
And you're beat up and ignored,  
Come home  
I'm coming home.
