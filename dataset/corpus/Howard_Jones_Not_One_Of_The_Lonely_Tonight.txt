Bring me down to earth  
Take this weight from tired shoulders  
Kiss me tenderly  
Let me drown in waves of your love  
You part the trees so I  
Can cherish things that matter  
Your single voice sounds through  
A room of din and chatter  
Oh take me home  
When the streetlights shine above  
Safe in your arms  
So simple to me  
Safe in your arms  
Oh so temporary  
Safe in you arms  
Oh so tenderly  
Not one of the lonely tonight  
Flying hectically  
Through a cloud of buts and maybes  
Passing frantically  
Over nights and days unended  
You turn my head and laugh  
When my world turns sour  
You give me strength to pass  
Through my darkest hour  
Oh take me home  
When the streetlights shine above
