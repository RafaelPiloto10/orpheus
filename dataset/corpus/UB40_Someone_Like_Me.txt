We don't need to make excuses  
Together we are free  
To throw away the rule book  
And start with ABC  
We can go to all the places  
We always wanted to be  
It takes a bad girl like you  
To love someone like me  
  
If you're looking for a daddy  
You won't get that from me  
There are things I want to do to you  
That he should never see  
You will never scare me baby  
You can try anything with me  
It takes a bad girl like you  
To love someone like me  
  
Don't need no little woman  
A wallflower's not for me  
The only way I want you girl  
Is independently  
won't lock you up in prison  
And throw away the key  
It takes a bad girl like you  
To love someone like me  
  
Not looking for redemption  
It's much too late for me  
The two of us together girl  
Can set each other free  
Children need a mother  
Buts it's not the same for me  
It takes a bad girl like you  
To love someone like me
