I need someones hand  
To lead me through the night  
Need someones arms  
To hold and squeeze me tight  
When the night begins  
I'm at an end  
'Cause I need your love so bad  
Need some lips to feel next to mine  
Need someone to stand up  
And tell my when I'm lying  
When the lights are low  
And it's time to go  
That's when I need your love so bad  
So why don't you give it up  
And bring it on home to me  
Or write it on a piece of paper, baby  
So it can be read to me  
Tell me that you love me  
Stop driving me mad  
Because I need your love so bad  
I need a soft voice  
To talk to me at night  
Don't won't to worry, baby  
I know we'll make everything alright  
Listen to my plea, yeah  
Bring it to me  
'Cause I need your love so bad  
Because I need your love so bad
