Wish it could be easy  
Why is life so messy  
Why is pain a part of us  
There are days I feel like  
Nothing ever goes right  
Sometimes it just hurts so much  
  
But You're here  
You're real  
I know I can trust You  
  
Even when it hurts  
Even when it's hard  
Even when it all just falls apart  
I will run to You  
Cause I know that You are  
  
Lover of my soul  
Healer of my scars  
You steady my heart  
You steady my heart  
  
I'm not gonna worry  
I know that You got me  
Right inside the palm of your hand  
Each and every moment  
What's good and what gets broken  
Happens just the way that You plan  
  
And I will run to You  
You're my refuge in Your arms  
And I will sing to You  
Cause of everything You are  
  
You steady my heart  
You steady my heart
