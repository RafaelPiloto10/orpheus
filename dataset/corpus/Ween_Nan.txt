Hi, I'm fuckin' Eddie Dingle  
I met this girl named Nan  
She, she overpopulated my senses  
And fuckin' dicked me over  
  
What's your big secret?  
Could you give me a clue?  
Oh, silly girl, I'm so in love with you  
Won't you tell me what's on your mind  
If you'd open your head tell me what would I find  
  
Are you for real? What do you feel?  
  
Finders keepers, losers weepers, baby  
If I could get the lid off, I'd look into the jar  
Is this the best thing that I can do?  
It ain't done me no good so far  
  
Mind over matter  
But it seems I don't matter at all (fucker)  
Nan, a table for one  
Do you think I could be invited to come? (fuck)  
  
What's your big secret?  
Could you give me a clue?  
Oh, silly, silly girl, I'm so in love with you  
Won't you tell me what's on your mind  
If you'd open your head tell me what would you find  
  
Are you for real? What do you feel?  
  
You know, I saw you yesterday walkin' with Danny  
He's a fucker, and you're a fucker too  
You know what you did to me baby?  
Yeah, you know what you did, now you're walkin' with Danny down the street  
How do you think that make me feel huh?  
How do you think that make me feel huh? Huh?  
You think I like it here, you fucker?  
You fuckin' bitch, I hate you, you fucker  
You keep walkin' with Danny  
You keep fuckin' walkin' with Danny, I don't give a fuck  
Yeah, I don't give a flying fuck about you or Danny, you bitch
