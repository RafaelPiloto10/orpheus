14 hours to go  
And the waiting's almost done  
When I get back home  
You're going to be the only one  
  
Staring at the lights or staring at the sun  
Everyday another fight or ill to overcome  
Another day another place  
Forgot the name but not the face  
I've been away for too long to remember  
  
14 hours to go  
And the waiting's almost done  
When I get back home  
You're going to be the only one  
  
Suspended animation countdown has begun  
Hurry up and wait for all of the things that must be done  
It doesn't matter what state I'm in  
They've all been waiting so let's begin  
I know that when I'm back I'm going to miss it  
  
I hate it when someone complains about their life  
So I hope you know exactly what I'm saying  
You won't get what you want without a sacrifice  
Just be careful what you wish for you might get it
