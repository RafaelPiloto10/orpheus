Social weapons that miss  
Pretend them to save  
Cowards bastards to shame  
Condemned social slaves  
  
Here to save the freaks again,  
You think and I bet you always will  
Here to save the freaks again,  
You think, here, here to save the freaks.  
Here to save the freaks again,  
You think, here, here to save the freaks.  
  
Snakes causing the fate  
Sadistic and free, so free  
Traders, defendents behave  
Lieges stay away, from me  
Oh, saints keep knocking  
Go home don't sell me mary,  
No no making the crazies well inside  
You think and I bet you always will  
  
Calling us no good, you are the social enemies.  
We change the people day to day  
Making us no good you are the social enemies.  
Changing the people day to day  
  
Agitators talking the show  
Messing with the heads  
To be the number one  
Smashers battling the hiv's  
Proud of yourselves aren't you  
Making the crazies well inside  
You think and I bet you always will  
  
Calling us no good, you are the social enemies.  
We change the people day to day  
Making us no good you are the social enemies.  
Changing the people day to day  
Calling us no good, you are the social enemies.  
We change the people day to day  
Making us no good you are the social enemies.  
Changing the people day to day  
  
Why must we play, so bitter me I'm suffering now  
The nowhere me, stop trying to say, you fell into this place  
So tragic you found the nowhere me  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks (the nowhere me)  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks (the nowhere me)  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks (the nowhere me)  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here, here to save the freaks
