Won't you come along with me  
To the Mississippi  
We'll take the boat to the land of dreams  
Steam down the river down to New Orleans  
The band's there to meet us  
And old friends to greet us  
Where all the people always meet  
Heaven on earth they call it Basin Street  
Basin Street is the street  
Where the elite always meet  
In New Orleans the land of dreams  
You'll never know how nice it seems or just how much it really means  
Glad to be oh yessiree  
Where welcome's free are dear to me  
Where I can lose  
My Basin Street blues  
Glad to be oh yessiree  
Where welcome's free are dear to me  
Where I can lose  
My Basin Street blues  
Ain't you glad you came with me  
Way down to the Mississippi  
We took the boat to the land of dreams  
Steam down the river to New Orleans
