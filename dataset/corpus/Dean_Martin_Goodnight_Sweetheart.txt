Goodnight sweetheart  
Til we meet tomorrow  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Sleep will vanish sorrow  
Tears and parting may make us forlorn  
But with the dawn a new day is born  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Though I'm not beside you  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Still my love will guide you  
Dreams will enfold you  
In each one I'll hold you  
Goodnight sweetheart  
Dreams will enfold you  
In each one I'll hold you  
Goodnight sweetheart goodnight
