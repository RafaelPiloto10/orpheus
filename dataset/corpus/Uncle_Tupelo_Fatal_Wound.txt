Don't the lights look empty  
When the streets are bare  
Almost as empty  
As the look you give me  
When I'm the only one  
  
And it's a long one  
So it brings you down  
So say you have nowhere else to go  
And nothing to do  
So you hang around  
You hang around  
  
But you wait around until  
You've received that fatal wound  
  
Columns of sunlight  
And glorious cities  
Oceans of opportunity  
And all your decisions seem ancient  
  
But you wait around until  
You've received that fatal wound
