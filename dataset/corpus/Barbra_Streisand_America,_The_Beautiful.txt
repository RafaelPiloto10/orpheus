O beautiful for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain!  
America! America!  
God shed his grace on thee,  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!  
O beautiful for heroes proved,  
In liberating strife,  
Who more than self, their country loved  
And more than life  
America! America!  
God mend thine every flaw,  
Confirm thy soul in self-control,  
Thy liberty in law!  
If you'd like to join me, please do!  
O beautiful for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain!  
America! America!  
God shed his grace on thee,  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea!  
To shining sea!
