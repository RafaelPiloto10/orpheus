If you could read my mind, love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old-time movie  
About a ghost from a wishing well  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
  
You know that ghost is me  
And I will never be set free as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see  
  
If I could read your mind, love  
What a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paperback novel  
The kind that drugstores sell  
When you reach the part  
Where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me  
The hero often fails  
And you won't read that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take  
  
I'll walk away like a movie star  
Who gets burned in a three-way script  
Enter number two  
A movie queen to play the scene  
Are bringing all the good things out in me  
But for now love, let's be real  
I never thought I could act this way  
And I've got to say, I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
