He made you feel plain  
When he forgot your name  
Let me tell you something  
I have felt the same  
I know you're in pain  
But be another boy along the way  
And God he made you beautiful and  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
You are jewel you're a treasure  
You are one of a kind  
And you shine just as bright  
As the stars in the sky  
You're a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right  
So keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothing about you that's plain  
No no no  
You tell me, you're not the type  
The kind of girl that they like  
And your a little insecure about  
How you look in their eyes  
Well fashion will change  
And trends come and go everyday  
But God only made one of you and  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
'Cause you are a jewel you're a treasure  
You are one of a kind and  
You shine just as bright as  
The stars in the sky  
You're a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right  
So keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
See your mind, it is precious  
Though your heart may be restless  
And your eyes they will see  
All that you're meant to be  
'Cause your spirit is strong  
And your soul carries on  
You'll keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
You know I've had my days  
When I feel out of place, yeah  
I look at who I am, cover what I can  
I wish it all would change but  
Take the makeup away  
You see the same girl still remains  
She may not feel that beautiful  
But there's nothin' about her that's plain  
And you are jewel you're a treasure  
You are one of a kind  
And you shine just as bright  
As the stars in the sky  
You're a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right so keep  
Your head up no matter the pain  
Keep your head up no matter the pain, ooh yeah  
Keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
You may have felt plain but  
God, he knows your name  
Let me tell you something  
There's nothin' about you that's plain
