Video, eo, eo, eo, eo, eo, eo  
The satellites that search the night they twinkle like a star  
They send their love from up above down to my vtr  
The world is at my fingers under control  
  
Ahhhumm, video, eo, eo, uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video, eh oh, got the world on my tv  
  
I see that rock and roll and all those old time movies  
They beam across the sky together in electric dreams  
I just sit here on my end I'll have it all  
  
Ahhhumm, video, eo, eo, uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video, eh oh, got the world on video  
  
I see the shadows in the twilight as they dance, la, la, la  
Video madness comes upon me like a trance in the dark  
So I just stay right here and the world is okay, okay, okay  
  
Ahhhumm, video, eo, eo, uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video, eh oh, got the world on video, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
  
And look at me now, I'm burning up the steely wires  
Look at me now, I'm burning up the steely wires  
Look at me now, now, now, now, now...........
