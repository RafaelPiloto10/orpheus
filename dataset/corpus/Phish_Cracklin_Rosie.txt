Yea, Cracklin' Rosie, get on board.  
We're gonna ride 'til there ain't no more to go.  
Takin' it slow, Lord don't you know,  
Happily a time when the poor man's let be  
  
Hitchin' on a twilight train,  
Ain't nothin' here that I care to take along,  
Maybe a song to sing when I'm long,  
Don't mean to say please, said old man, I'm happy too.  
  
Oh, I love my Rosie child, you got the way to make me happy.  
You and me, we go in style.  
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store-bought woman,  
You make me sing like a guitar hummin.  
  
Hang on to me, girl, our song keeps runnin' on.  
Play it now, Play it now, Play it now my lady!  
Cracklin Rosie, make me smile.  
God it'll last for an hour, well that's alright,  
  
We got all night, to set the world right.  
Find us a dream and don't ask no questions Yea!  
  
[Chorus]  
Bah, bah bah bah bah.  
Bah, bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah  
Bah bah bah bah  
Bah, bah bah bah bah  
Bah, bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah BAH
