Here I go again.  
Watch it now 'cos  
Here I go again.  
I've been hurt so much before.  
  
I told myself,  
Yes I did,  
No more, no more won't get hurt any more.  
There I was by myself  
  
Doin' all right  
Until I saw you last night.  
And then I knew that  
Here I go again.  
  
I cannot help it.  
Here I go again.  
Making the same mistakes,  
Heading for more heartaches.  
  
What can I do when there's nothing I can do?  
I looked in your eyes and I knew that I was blue.  
What 's the use?  
I'll just give in.  
  
Try as I may,  
And I do,  
I'll never win, never win, baby I'll never win.  
Now, you're here, so close to me.  
  
I can't resist you,  
And I knew when I kissed you.  
I'm gonna sing now  
Here I go again.  
  
Watch it now 'cos  
Here I go again.  
Falling in love, in love.  
Falling in love, in love.  
  
Falling in love, in love.  
Falling in love.
