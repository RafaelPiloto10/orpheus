Turn on your receiver, I'm gonna lay it on the line  
'Cause I'm a great believer, in hangin' on to what is mine  
So come over here and listen, I don't want you to be missin'  
What I say  
And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again  
  
I've been hearin' stories, 'fact the word's all over town  
I've had my share of worries ever since you've been around  
So come over hear and listen, I don't want you to be missin'  
What I say  
And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again  
  
Turn on your receiver, there's a message comin' through  
Keep your hands off my woman  
Keep your hands to yourself  
Keep your hands off my woman
