That old wind that's whipping out there  
It's whistlin' your tune  
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt  
And footprints to the moon  
And that old star that you been wishin' on  
Is shinin' mighty bright  
But it's the fire inside your heart  
That's gonna lead you to the light  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to live there  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance  
You know failure isn't failure  
If a lesson from it's learned  
I guess love would not be love  
Without a risk of being burned  
Anything in life worth havin'  
Lord, it has its sacrifice  
But the gift that you're receiving  
Is worth more than a price  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to live there  
How you ever gonna know  
What you never knew  
How you ever gonna know  
If you're down here doin'  
What the good Lord put you here to do  
How you ever gonna know  
If you could have done it  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to fly  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never dare to try  
Listen not to the critics  
Who put their own dreams on the shelf  
If you want to get the truth to admit it  
You gotta find out for yourself  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to be there  
How you ever gonna know  
If you're the best  
How you ever gonna know  
What you believe in  
If you don't put it to the test  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold him  
How you ever gonna know  
What livin' means  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never chase the dreams  
How you ever gonna know  
Your potential  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What it's like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance
