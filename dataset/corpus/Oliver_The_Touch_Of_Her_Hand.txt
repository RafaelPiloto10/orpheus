Here goes another day  
I'm rollin' more miles away  
And I would give anything  
To see her tonight  
  
Two more weeks of this endless road  
Another loneliness overload  
Ah, but I'd wait a hundred years  
For a glimpse of her smile  
And the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
Half-kept promises  
And dreamer's hopes  
Love by phone  
And "miss you" notes  
And I meant to give so much more  
Well, so much for plans  
  
But if she thinks that I've let her down  
Chasin' fool's gold from town to town  
You would never know by the love in her eyes  
Or the laugh in her voice  
Or the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm  
Anything I could hope to be...
