Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas  
Everybody's sniffing it Banapple gas  
O-o alas!  
All the world is stuck on it Banapple gas.  
  
Does it do you good, make you better  
Set you healthy when you're bed-tied?  
Well I don't know if it makes you well  
But it must be healthy  
'Cause it don't smell.  
  
Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas  
Everybody's living on Banapple gas  
O-o alas!  
All the world is grooving on Banapple gas.  
  
Do you know what goes inside to make it  
What kind of strange spice makes it right?  
Well I don't know what kind of spice  
But it must be healthy 'cause it's sterilized.  
  
Banapple gas, Banapple gas  
Give me more Banapple gas  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Does it help you smile more to wake up  
Make you happy just to be alive?  
Well I don't know if it makes you happy  
But it must be healthy  
'Cause it's certified.  
  
Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas  
All the world is breathing Banapple gas  
Oh oh alas!  
No one knows what's inside it Banapple gas  
Oh Banapple gas.
