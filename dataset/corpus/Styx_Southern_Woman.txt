First met you in a southern town  
On a warm November day  
You made me smoke like a whirlwind  
I knew we had nothing to say  
Love me but don't try and make me stay  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Once again in the early spring  
I touched your raven's crown  
Your wild eyed stories of rare delight  
Like to knock me down  
It's getting so damn hard to put you down  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Southern woman  
Yeah
