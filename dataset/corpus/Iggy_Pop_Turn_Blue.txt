See a black El Dorado  
Oh, rolling along down below my window  
That black girl in the back looks pretty good  
Christ! She's beautiful  
You know how soft she is  
Just what you feel like  
  
Oh, I'm so far away from her  
Jesus this is Iggy  
You, you might as well come with me,  
When you ride the ride  
There's talk and I don't wanna talk  
  
Oh momma, I shot myself down  
Oh momma, I shot myself down  
Oh momma, I shot myself down  
Oh momma, I shot myself down  
  
They're stepping on our hearts  
Stepping on our hearts  
I don't know why they're stepping on our hearts  
Stepping on our hearts  
Damn, I don't know why  
Stepping on our hearts  
Stepping on our hearts  
Stepping on our hearts  
Stepping on our hearts  
Stepping on our hearts  
Can't you see, oh no, Stepping on our hearts  
  
How come the blacks, how come they, they copy you so good?  
They get off on you, so sexually?  
If you wanna make it  
Young man you gotta make somebody come  
Come out of your black  
Come out of your black  
Black and strong and black black and strong and  
Black! Strong! Black!  
  
Jesus it's cold in this room, it's really cold  
You know I never, I never told you about this, but there's one guy  
Somebody I really love, he's never around  
Well he was taking things that could be alright, that could be nice  
And make him so ugly, so damn ugly  
And we put out the lights on them  
Yeah, we'd make it dark, we put out the lights, on them  
It's idiots like you that screw me up  
I know there's nothing to you  
And I don't know why I treat you so kind  
Come down and dance with me, dance with me  
You got nobody left but me  
Oh accept me, don't reject me, don't forget me  
Momma, what color will the lights be? Will they turn blue on me?  
Momma, what color will the lights be?  
Will they turn blue on me?  
Momma, I shot myself up, whoa momma, I shot myself up  
Momma, I shot myself up, up, up, up, up  
Momma, I shot myself  
Up down, up down momma  
Oh oh oh oh oh momma  
I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't mean to, but I did it,  
I shot myself up  
Momma I shot myself!
