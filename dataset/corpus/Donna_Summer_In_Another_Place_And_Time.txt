I can't lie  
I was attracted too  
Somehow the feelings  
Were so strong inside  
But I'm not free to be  
In love with you maybe  
Things would be different  
In another place and time  
  
And I can't give you  
All you want me to  
And I know you deserve  
The best from me  
But I can't give you more  
Of all that you long for  
I would have loved you  
In another place and time  
  
Dreams aren't always bound to come true  
But that's no reason you should cry  
  
'Cause I would have loved you  
Really loved you  
In another place and time  
  
I'm hurting deep inside  
Just want you to know  
Oh, I would have loved you  
Oh yeah, in another place and time  
  
Fate can't always be led by you  
The time ain't right for you and I  
  
In another place and time  
In another place and time
