Jack my friend, he's a busy man  
Trying to hustle an easy buck instead of a good man's dollar  
Oh Jack my buddy he's so goddamn full of money  
Workin' for a funny company for his father  
He got a black satin shirt best you could buy  
And a big fat straw hat to match his white tie  
And a shiny thirty-eight that'll look you straight in your eye  
Jack miraculous he was a' sure spectaculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack ...  
He got a black satin shirt best you could buy  
And a big fat straw hat to match his white tie  
And a big twenty-two that'll make you do what he want  
Jack miraculous he was a' sure spectaculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack ... Jack miraculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack
