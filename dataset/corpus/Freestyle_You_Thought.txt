You know today is a new day you see,  
  
I'll stab you the back and then sting like a bee,  
  
My ride be sit'n on some twenties,  
  
You thought you could battle me,  
  
While your ride sits on them little three's,  
  
Its like your jumping in the ring trying to box with Ali,  
  
Just stay in pee wees,  
  
You and all them are about same height I can see,  
  
You'll never be more then a shadow standing behind me
