Hey baby won't you take a chance.  
Say that you'll let me have this dance.  
  
Well let's dance, let's dance.  
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potatoes too,  
Any old dance that you want to do.  
Well let's dance, well let's dance.  
  
Hey baby yeah you thrill the soul  
Hold me tight, never let me go.  
  
Let's dance...  
Hey baby if you're all alone  
Baby you'll let me walk you home  
  
Let's dance...  
Hey baby yeah you swing it right.  
Yes I know that tonight's the night.  
Let's dance... Well let's dance, well let's dance
