Each day I'll do a golden deed  
By helping those who are in need  
My life on earth is but a span  
And so I'll do the best I can.  
  
Refrain:  
Life's evening sun is sinking low  
A few more days, and I must go  
To meet the deeds that I have done  
Where there will be no setting sun.  
  
To be a child of God each day  
My light must shine along the way  
I'll sing His praise while ages roll  
And strive to help some troubled soul.  
  
The only life that will endure  
Is one that's kind and good and pure  
And so for God I'll take my stand  
Each day I'll lend a helping hand.  
  
I'll help someone in time of need  
And journey on with rapid speed  
I'll help the sick and poor and weak  
And words of kindness to them speak.  
  
While going down life's weary road  
I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load  
I'll try to turn the night to day  
Make flowers bloom along the way.
