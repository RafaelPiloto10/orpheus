Ghetto freak show...  
It's three o'clock in the morning and you're sleeping  
Wicked clowns in the moonlight creeping  
Slide through your window under your bed  
  
Crawl in through your ear, eat your head  
Bumping into bones 'cause I need light  
Tip-toeing down through your windpipe  
Climbing down your spine was the fun part  
  
Looky looky and I think I see your fucking heart  
Uh huh so I'm stabbing like it ain't nothing  
Wicked clown cut his way out your belly button  
I'm like a vulture waiting in a dark place  
  
Swooping down and I'm picking at your dead face  
I'm sick but you don't know the whole deal  
No one ever loved me and they never will  
Bitch, I take you out on a blind date  
  
But then they find you dead under a wooden crate  
Rapped in a bag deep in the woods  
'Cause my mother always said I was no good  
Locked me in a closet, fed me dog shit  
  
Well, I'm out now, so motherfucker watch it  
The insanity's grip will never let go  
Here's your chance to a glimpse of a ghetto freak show  
I'd rather be dead...ghetto freak show...  
  
I'm a freak show coming to your house  
Standing at your porch, chewing on a dead mouse  
I'm looking like a fly so you swat me  
Keep chasing me even though you got me  
  
So what you wanna do to a ghetto thug  
First you starve me and feed me them fuckin' drugs  
Turn me into a wicked, wicked cat  
I'm coming to your house, so catch ya catch ya clown  
  
Gotta have a fucking throat, hatchet once, hatchet twice  
Gotta have the governor, the richer fucker, pay the price  
Driving with your woman, that's sweet  
Never even know I'm in the back seat  
  
Chat chit-chat about the weather  
But then I slam they fucking heads together  
Is it jealousy, they never loved me  
So now I'm ripping out your guts and it's ugly  
  
I'm trapped, don't wanna be a rich man  
Not a poor man, I need my own land  
Because the rich man be stressing all the dumb stuff  
They cut there fucking wrists if the grass ain't green enough  
  
Right there in your face, you can't tag it  
Just found out your son is a faggot  
Dick-sucking, butt-fucking homo man  
If ya stressing then you better talk to mojo man  
  
Insanity's grip will never let go  
Here's your chance to catch a glimpse of a ghetto freak show  
I'd rather be dead...ghetto freak show
