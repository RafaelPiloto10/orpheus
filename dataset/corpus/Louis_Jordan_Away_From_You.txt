It made me cry  
To say good-bye,  
I'm sad and blue,  
Now that you've gone  
I can't go on  
Away from you.  
  
I smile to hide  
The tears inside,  
It's hard to do,  
My happiness,  
My life's success  
Depends on you.  
  
The hours seem long,  
The world goes wrong,  
When we're apart,  
My skies are gray,  
What can I say  
To soothe my heart?  
  
It is the end,,  
I can't pretend  
That I'm not blue,  
Oh, can't you see  
Life's misery  
Away from you!  
  
The hours are long,  
The world goes wrong,  
When we're apart,  
My skies are gray,  
What can I say  
To soothe my heart?  
  
It is the end,  
I can't pretend  
That I'm not blue,  
Oh, can't you see  
Life's misery  
Away from you!  
Away from you!
