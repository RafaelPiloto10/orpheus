It's been like this from the start  
One piece after another to make my heart  
You mistake the game for being smart  
Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark  
But the sound of the steel  
And the crush and the grind  
It'll scream cause who am I to decide my life  
But in time it all dies  
There's nothing left inside  
Just rusted metal that was never even mine  
  
I would scream  
But I'm just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
God, set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey!  
Stop trying to live my life for me,  
I need to breathe  
I'm not your robot  
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine  
I'm breaking free  
Can't you see?  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
  
All this time,  
I've been misled  
There was nothing but crossed wires in my head  
I've been taught to think about what I feel  
Doesn't matter at all until you say it's real  
  
I would scream  
But I'm just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
Set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey!  
Stop trying to live my life for me,  
I need to breathe  
I'm not your robot  
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine  
I'm breaking free  
Can't you see?  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
I'm not your robot  
  
I would scream  
But I'm just this hollow shell  
Waiting here  
Begging please  
Set me free so I can feel  
  
Hey!  
Stop trying to live my life for me,  
I need to breathe  
I'm not your robot  
Stop telling me I'm part of this big machine  
I'm breaking free  
Can't you see?  
I can love  
I can speak  
Without somebody else operating me  
You gave me eyes and now I see  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
  
I'm not your robot  
I'm just me  
I'm not your robot!
