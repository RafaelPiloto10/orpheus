The more you win, the more you gain  
An open window to the human brain  
The more you give, the more you lose  
You can't go dancing in these mountain shoes  
And that won't do.  
The more you touch, the more you feel  
It's just a picture that you thought was real  
The less you need, the more you know  
You can say the prophet told you so  
Do do dooo  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove.  
VERSE 2  
The world is just potato chips  
Joined together at the female hips  
The Universe we left behind  
We never know what we are going to find.  
Do do dooo  
And when we want to be alone  
To get away, baby, to another zone  
The word is out, the clothes are in  
And who knows maybe it's another sin  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The more you win, the more you gain  
An open window to the human brain  
The more you touch, the more you feel  
It's just a picture that you thought was real  
You thought was real  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove
