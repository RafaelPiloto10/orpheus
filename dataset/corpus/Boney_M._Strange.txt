Strange, how you stopped loving me!  
How you stopped needing me!  
When you came along, oh how strange!  
Strange, how you stopped loving me!  
How you stopped needing me!  
When you came along, oh how strange!  
Strange, you change like night and day  
Just stopped and walked away  
When you came along, oh how strange!  
Well I guess that I was meant to be  
A puppet on a string  
To think I found you really love me  
Look what love can bring  
Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a foolish me  
I still care for you, oh how strange!  
How strange!  
Well I guess that I was meant to be  
A puppet on a string  
To think I found you really love me  
Look what love can bring  
Strange, how you stopped loving me!  
How you stopped needing me!  
When you came along, oh how strange!  
Strange, you change like night and day  
Just stopped and walked away  
When you came along, oh how strange!  
Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a foolish me  
I still care for you, oh how strange!  
Well I guess that I was meant to be

Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a foolish me  
I still care for you, oh...
