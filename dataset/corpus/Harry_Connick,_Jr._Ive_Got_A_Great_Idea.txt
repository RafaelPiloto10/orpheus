I've got a great idea  
And wouldn't you like to know  
You probably can't bear it  
So I guess I'll have to share it  
I thought of it a moment ago  
  
It starts with your hand in mine  
And next comes a little stroll  
You probably won't buy it  
But I'm trying to keep it quiet  
So please don't tell a soul  
  
'cause if you do  
The world and you  
Will think I'm crazy and give me medicine  
They'll drag me away  
And as I go you'll hear me say  
I could have been a decent match for edison  
  
Ideas are few and far between  
And good ideas are rarer still  
So listen and be wise  
Just forget the other guys  
'cause my idea's no good for three  
My idea is you and me
