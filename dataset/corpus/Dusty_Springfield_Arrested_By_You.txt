What is this strange elation?  
Taking my train of thought to an unknown destination  
And suddenly I don't know where I am  
But like a tremor or a spark  
Something's happening in my heart  
  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
  
You've broken my concentration  
Saving me just in time from a desperate situation  
And suddenly, I don't know who I am  
But my dilemma's where to start  
Something's happening in my heart  
  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh, oh, oh  
Finally captured by you, by you and by you  
Take me in  
I've been arrested by you  
Take me in, oh  
Finally captured by you, oh, oh  
Take me in  
I've been captured, captured, captured, captured  
Oh, baby  
Oh, ho,  
Take me baby  
Oh, oh, oh, oh
