I just wanna be a playboy, play it night an' day boy  
Just wanna have lots of fun  
Chase the girls and spend lots of mon...  
I just wanna be a playboy, 'cause that's the only way boy  
To really get a lotta lovin' done, while I'm still young  
I don't especially want a limousine  
I don't especially want a Cadillac  
I just want a hot rod machine and really wreck a back  
I just wanna be a playboy, just wanna be the real Mccoy  
I don't really want a steady girl  
I kinda like to give 'em all the whirl  
I just wanna be a playboy, I just wanna spread lots of joy  
I gotta get a lotta lovin' done, while I'm still young playboy!
