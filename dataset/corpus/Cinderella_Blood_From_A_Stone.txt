Well I've been walkin'  
Down a one way dirty street  
Tryin' to find the answers  
And I've been hopin'  
For a chance to meet  
The rat that spread the cancer  
  
And the lies they've been spinnin'  
And the smiles they've been grinnin'  
There has sure been some sinnin'  
But nobody's winnin'  
When the walls start to crumblin'  
You feel like you're stumblin'  
And nobody wants you when you're down  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they can't take the city from  
the boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get blood from a stone  
You can't get blood from a stone  
  
Well I'm a rollin'  
But my train's gone off the tracks  
and my wheels are spinnin'  
And I'm a walkin'  
Down a one way dirty street  
But my heart's not sinkin'  
  
From the love they've been buyin'  
And the blues they've been cryin'  
Now the time keeps a flyin'  
But nobody's tryin'  
Cause the love of the money  
Didn't turn out so sunny  
When the well's dry  
No one comes around  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they can't take the city from the  
Boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get from a stone  
  
You can try  
But I still got the fight in my eyes  
Suck it dry  
Cause I've had about enough of your lies  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they can't take the city form the  
Boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get blood from a stone  
  
They took the boy form the city  
But they can't take the city from the  
Boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's looking like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get blood from a stone
