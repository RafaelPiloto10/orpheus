[Frank:]  
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie  
All the day and night-time hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion  
That I could fall with so much emotion  
[Barbra:]  
I wonder... Could you coo, now, could you care  
For a cozy cottage we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you  
[Barbra:] I've got a crush on you,  
[Frank:] I've got a crush on you,  
[Barbra:] Sweetie pie  
[Frank:] Sweetie pie  
[Barbra:] All the day and night-time  
[Frank:] All the day and night-time  
[Barbra:] Hear me sigh  
[Frank:] Hear me sigh  
[Both:] I never had the least notion  
[Frank:] That I could fall with...  
[Barbra:] I'd fall with...  
[Frank:] So much...  
[Barbra:] So much emotion  
[Frank:] So much emotion  
Could you coo?  
[Barbra:] I could coo!  
[Frank:] Could you possibly care?  
[Barbra:] I could care!  
[Frank:] For a lovely cottage...  
[Barbra:] Ooo that cottage  
[Both:] That we could share!  
The world will pardon my mush  
[Frank:] Yes, I have got a crush, my Barbra, on you!  
[Barbra:] You will make me blush, Francis!  
[Frank:] Yes!  
[Both:] I have got a crush, my baby, on you...
