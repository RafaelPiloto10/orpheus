Open the door and let the night come crawlin' in  
Take a bite of the core of the original sin  
Yeah, you're ready for more  
But you just don't know where to begin (yeah you do)  
  
This is your last chance to get it right  
Do your dance on the edge of the knife  
It's your last chance so just roll the dice  
'Cause nobody here is getting out alive  
  
You want it, you need it so get on the ride  
Yeah, you heard you'll be sorry but you know that they lied  
Yeah, there's so much here that you wanna see  
You'll give it up eventually, yeah, yeah  
So come on and open your eyes  
You gotta live or you die  
  
Hey!  
Your last chance  
  
This is your last chance to get it right  
Do your dance on the edge of the knife  
Do your dance, dance, dance on the edge of the knife  
Let's go!  
  
This is your last chance, yeah  
This is your last chance, right  
This is your last chance  
Yeah!
