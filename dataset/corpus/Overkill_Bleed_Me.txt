Bleed me, Let it out slow suck me dry  
You got to feed me take me down low  
Where those angels fly  
ain't nothing that I need no more  
Like a full truckload of pain  
All over like the final score  
With a fist full of open veins, you got to bleed me  
To all the people that I loved I hated lied  
To all my enemies that tried  
[CH]  
Bleed me  
Read me torn out pages in an open book  
Got to please me one more razor now before I cook  
Getting hotter as the seconds pass  
But I'm told that's what I need  
Getting colder now it's flowing fast  
But I'm told that's why I bleed  
To all the people that I loved I hated lied  
To all my enemies that tried  
[CH]  
[BR]  
I remember sitting in the open air  
I remember calling out your name  
I remember clearly that I didn't care  
I hadn't changed  
I need to go away  
I need to leave you here  
I need to face my fears
