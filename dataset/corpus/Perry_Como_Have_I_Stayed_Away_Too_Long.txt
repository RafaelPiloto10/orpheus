Have I stayed away too long?  
Have I stayed away too long?  
If I came home tonight, would you still be my darlin' ?  
Or, have I stayed away too long?  
  
The love light that shone so strong  
Sweet love light that shone so strong  
If I came home tonight, would that same light be shinin' ?  
Or, have I stayed away too long?  
  
I'm just outside of town  
I'll soon be at your door  
But maybe I'd be wrong to hurry there  
I'd best keep out of town, and worry you no more  
For, maybe someone else has made you care  
  
Have all of my dreams gone wrong?  
My beautiful dreams gone wrong?  
If I came home tonight, would you still be my darlin' ?  
Or, have I stayed away too long?  
  
I'd best keep out of town, and worry you no more  
For, maybe someone else has made you care  
  
Have all of my dreams gone wrong?  
My beautiful dreams gone wrong?  
If I came home tonight, would you still be my darlin' ?  
Or, have I stayed away too long?  
  
Stayed away too long?
