You're in deeper than you seem  
What you need, what you want  
Are not the same thing  
I think you're getting sick on the dream  
  
I don't want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please don't make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
You told me that we could make it right  
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight  
Do you think forevers only last all night  
  
I don't want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please don't make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
First it's promises then it's lies  
Watch those stares turn to turned-away eyes  
  
You told me that we could make it right  
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight  
Do you think forevers only last all night  
I don't want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please don't make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
Till you know the cost  
Of love
