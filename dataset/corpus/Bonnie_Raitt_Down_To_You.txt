Come around cryin' that you just can't win  
You thought this one was different' now it's gone again  
You just can't believe, baby  
Why's it happenin' to me now  
  
You step out on the track in the pouring rain,  
And when you get run over will you blame the train?  
You just can't deny, baby,  
Life is passing you by, baby  
  
And don't you think you've had enough?  
Ain't it time to get a different view?  
You can't just wait around for what you want  
It's all about the way you choose  
Ain't nobody else that can make things right  
Baby, it's down to you  
  
Everywhere you look they're trying' to do you in  
You just can't understand, they used to be your friend  
It's always the same, baby  
Someone else is to blame, baby  
  
Still ain't got a clue to where it all goes down  
'Cause what you're dishing out is coming back around  
Same old song, baby  
Gone all too long now  
  
Dont'cha think that you've had enough?  
Ain't it time to get a different view  
You can't just wait around for what you want  
It's all about the way you choose  
Ain't nobody else that can make things right  
Baby, it's down to you  
Down to you  
  
Dont'cha think that you've had enough?  
Ain't it time to get a different view  
Can't just wait around for what you want  
It's all about the way you choose  
Ain't nobody else that can make things right  
Baby, it's down to you  
Down to you, honey
