There is a time when a man needs somebody to talk to  
Someone to talk to, somebody who'll always be there  
(All alone) Nothin' seemed to matter  
(So alone) Doesn't get much better  
(Can't explain) Something that you're feeling  
For the very first time  
  
There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to  
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere  
(All alone) Suddenly you see her  
(So alone) You know you're gonna meet her  
(Can't explain) Something that you're feeling  
For the very first time  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the way  
That you're feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that it's right  
  
There was a time that you needed somebody to count on  
You needed someone to count on, somebody to care  
(Now she's here) Nothin' seems to matter  
(She's so near) Everything is better  
(Can't explain) Something that you're feeling  
For the very first time  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the way  
That you're feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that it's right  
(And you know that it's right)  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the air  
That you're breathing tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you're holding her tight  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the way  
That you're feeling tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you know that it's right  
(And you know that it's right)  
  
Then along comes a woman  
There's a change in the air  
That you're breathing tonight  
Then along comes a woman  
And you're holding her tight
