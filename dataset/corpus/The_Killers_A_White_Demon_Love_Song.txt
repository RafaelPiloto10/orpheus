White demon love song down the hall  
White demon shadow on the road  
Back up your mind, there is a call  
He isn't coming after all  
Love this time  
She likes the way he sings  
White demon love song's in her dreams  
  
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?  
White demon sorrow will arrange  
Let's not forget about the fear  
Black invitation to this place that cannot change  
While strangely holy, come for a rain  
  
(Darling)  
  
White demon, widen your heart's scope  
White demon, who let your friends go?  
White demon, widen your heart's scope  
White demon, who let your friends go?  
  
Let us be in love  
(Let us be in love)  
Let's do old and grey  
(Let's do old and grey)  
I won't make you cry  
(I won't make you cry)  
I will never stray  
(I will never stray)  
I will do my part  
(I will do my part)  
Let us be in love tonight  
  
White demon, widen your heart's scope  
White demon, who let your friends go?  
White demon, widen your heart's scope  
White demon, who let your friends go?  
  
(Stand it anymore, darling)  
(Stand it)  
  
(I can't stand it anymore, darling)  
(Stand it)
