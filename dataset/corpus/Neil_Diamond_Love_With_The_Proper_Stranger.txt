I could fall in love with the proper stranger  
If I heard the bells and the banjos ring  
If two certain eyes with the look of danger  
Smiled a welcome warm as spring  
If the beating in my heart  
Sounded out a warning  
"Don't let her,"  
"Don't let her walk through the door"  
"This is the one you've been waiting for"  
Oh, yes, I'd know  
However wild it seems,  
You know I'd know  
And I'd whisper  
"Come take my hand, proper stranger"  
"Don't go through life as a stranger"  
"For I'm a poor proper stranger, too"  
"Don't let her,"  
"Don't let her walk through the door"  
"This is the one you've been waiting for"  
Oh, yes, I'd know  
However wild it seems,  
You know I'd know  
And I'd whisper  
"Come take my hand, proper stranger"  
"Don't go through life as a stranger"  
"For I'm a poor proper stranger, too"
