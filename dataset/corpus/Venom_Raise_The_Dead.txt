Rising from my deadly tomb I've got  
maddened eyes with fright  
fingers bleeding fast heart beating  
the moons my only light  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
If God won't have me, then the Devil must  
  
[CHORUS:]  
we will raise the dead  
we will raise the dead  
we will raise the dead  
stop at nothing raise the dead  
Gaze across the blackened yard  
my mind is filled with dread  
so give me all the powers of Hell  
and I'll raise the dead  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
The hotter the fire, the greater the lust  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I hear the star of the Necromancer  
my blood is black and my heart doth bleed  
I am infernal and my mind's in torment  
I'll raise the dead make the world unclean  
  
Laughing as my legions rise  
control the zombies mind  
I hold Hell close to my breast  
I'm leaving God behind  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
I'll enter hellfire, I'll break the crust  
  
[CHORUS:]
