Papa, can you hear me?  
Papa, can you see me?  
Papa, can you find me in the night?  
Papa, are you near me?  
Papa, can you hear me?  
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?  
  
Looking at the skies I see a million eyes  
Which ones are yours?  
Where are you now  
That yesterday has waved goodbye  
And closed it's doors  
The night is so much darker  
The wind is so much colder  
The world is so much bigger  
Now that I am alone.  
  
Papa, please forgive me  
I know you understand me  
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?  
Oh, can you hear me prayin'?  
Anything I'm sayin'?  
  
Even though the night is filled with voices  
I remember everything you ever taught me  
Evey book I've ever read.  
  
Can all the words,  
All the music help me face what's ahead?  
The trees are so much taller  
I feel so much smaller  
The moon is twice as lonely  
And the stars are half as bright.  
  
Daddy, how I love you  
Daddy, how I need you  
Daddy, how I miss you  
Kissing me goodnight.
