What's troubling Gus? You sound demented  
Is it because someone talked and she told me?  
He no longer thinks anything that moves  
And everything he sees is something to kill and eat  
what's troubling Gus? Is it nothing goes quiet?  
The whip-poor-will at dusk  
what's troubling Gus? Overhearing conversations  
But it?s because you're too either them or me  
Well, it?s either them or it?s us anything that moves  
And everything you see is something to kill and eat  
what's troubling Gus? Is it nothing goes quiet?  
Is that what's troubling ya Gus? The mere mention of the name  
Used to be enough to make every bird stop singing  
Is that what's troubling ya Gus? No one is afraid enough  
what's troubling Gus? Is it nothing goes quiet?  
Is that what's troubling ya Gus? The mere mention of the name  
Used to be enough to make every bird stop singing  
The whip-poor-will at dusk, tells you no one is afraid  
No one is afraid enough  
Is it afraid? Or is it afraid enough?  
Troubling Gus
