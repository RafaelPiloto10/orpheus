Now we take our time  
So nonchalant  
And spend our nights  
So Bon vivant  
We dress our days  
In silken robes  
The money comes  
The money goes  
We know it's all a passing phase,  
  
We light our lamps  
For atmosphere  
And hang our hopes  
On chandeliers  
We're going wrong  
We're gaining weight  
We're sleeping long  
And far too late  
And so it's time  
To change our ways  
But I've loved these days.  
  
Now as we indulge  
In things refined  
We hide our hearts  
From harder times  
A string of pearls  
A foreign car  
Oh we can only go so far  
On caviar and Cabernet.  
  
We drown our doubts  
In dry champagne  
And soothe our souls  
With fine cocaine  
I don't know why I even care  
We'll get so high  
And get nowhere  
We'll have to change our jaded ways,  
But I've loved these days.  
  
So before we end  
And then begin  
We'll drink a toast to how it's been  
A few more hours to be complete  
A few more nights on satin sheets  
A few more times that I can say,  
I've loved these days.
