Half of 8  
2 of 4  
Nothing's less  
Less is more  
  
3 fine chords  
1 sharp hook  
Get a shouter with a dirty look  
  
Could be the lemon  
Could be the cream  
Tasty tasty  
In your dreams  
  
Strap it on long  
Throw it down hard  
Pull it up tight with that crazy 5 bar  
  
59 Crunch  
59 Crunch  
59 Crunch

Eat it raw  
Now eat it alive

Deep deep water  
Where the big fish go  
Relax relax  
Ride it down slow  
  
Not too early  
Not too late  
On the money now incinerate  
  
Deep deep water  
Ride it down slow  
Not too early, not too late  
On the money now incinerate  
  
59 Crunch  
59  
59 Crunch

59 Crunch  
59 Crunch
