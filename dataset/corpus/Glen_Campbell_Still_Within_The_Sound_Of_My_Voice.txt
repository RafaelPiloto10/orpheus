Where have you gone, my darling one?  
Are you on your own?  
Are you having fun?  
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad?  
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had?  
  
Does a day go by like a memory?  
Do you ever try to remember me  
In an automobile or a crowded bar?  
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are  
  
And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio  
I just want you to know you were always my only choice  
And where ever you go then I still love you so,  
if you're still within the sound of my voice.  
  
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?  
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all  
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head?  
Was it really me talking to your heart instead?  
  
And if you are still within the sound of my voice  
watching this video, I just want you to know  
That it always made me rejoice  
Just to have you so near  
There's a place for you here  
If you're still within the sound of my voice.  
  
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries  
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies  
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress  
but only you can send a lifeline out to me.  
  
Are you still within the sound of my voice?  
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong  
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will  
Are you still within the sound of my voice  
  
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries  
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
