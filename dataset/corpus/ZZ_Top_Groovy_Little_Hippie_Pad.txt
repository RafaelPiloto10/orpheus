I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad.  
I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad.  
I work a hundred grand scam from a border town.  
Well, I'll be feeling glad.  
  
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama,  
In a Jeep with a German Shepherd by her side.  
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama,  
With boots and a forty-four on her side.  
And if I ain't too hjigh or used up,  
I'll have her take me for a groovy little hippie ride.  
  
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day,  
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red.  
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day,  
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red.  
That's all I need to get groovy,  
That's what all the little hippie said.
