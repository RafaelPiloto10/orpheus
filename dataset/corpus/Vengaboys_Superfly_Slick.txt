Big boy showing of all around the city  
Still the same for such a  
Suite  
Thinking you're so bad  
Hustlin' girls, handy phone, acting like your  
Busy baby let me tell you, you're the worst I ever had

Highbrow attitude, really don't impress me  
I know where you're coming from  
See right through your game  
Luxury overdose won't make you possess me  
Baby let me tell you, in the end it's all the same  
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get  
You out of my heart  
No need denying that you have been lying  
Right from the start  
I thought this love would take us to the  
Heights of sensuality  
But now I know that you're not even half  
The man you said you'd be  
  
Don't think I'm crying and trying to get  
You out of my heart  
No need denying that you have been lying  
Right from the start  
I thought this love would take us to the  
Heights of sensuality  
But now I know that you're not even half  
The man you said you'd be
