Beat surrender  
Come on boy, come on girl  
Succumb to the beat surrender  
All the things that I care about (are packed into one punch)  
All the things that I'm not sure about (are sorted out at once)  
  
And as it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end  
That bullshit is bullshit, it just goes by different names  
  
All the things that I shout about (but never act upon)  
All the courage and the dreams that I have  
(but seem to wait so long)  
My doubt is cast aside, watch phonies run to hide  
The dignified don't even enter in the game  
  
And if you feel there's no passion  
No quality sensation  
Seize the young determination  
Show the fakers you ain't foolin'  
You'll see me come runnin'  
To the sound of your strummin'  
Fill my heart with joy and gladness  
I've lived too long in shadows of sadness
