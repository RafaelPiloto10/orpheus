Every time you go  
Every time you go  
  
It starts with a picture  
And it sits in your frame  
And we part with a letter  
And it ends in my name  
It starts with forever  
And it ends with a touch  
And I know that you're clever  
And I don't ask for much oh  
  
Maybe we forgot all the things we are  
When we are together  
  
You said I'm arresting  
You said I had heat  
I really thought that we would go further  
The second time we'd meet  
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you  
All I want to do is sleep  
But perhaps when I'm sleeping  
You'll get back on your feet  
  
Maybe we forgot all the things we are  
When we are together  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm at my weakest  
It's not so hard  
Every time you go  
  
I run out to meet you  
When I knew the storm had come  
And I felt the rain on your face  
And the damage you have done  
And I know what you're thinking  
It will never be the end  
And when the storm is over  
You won't see me again  
Do know all the regrets I paid  
For all the times I saved we were together  
  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm my weakest  
It's not so hard  
  
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?  
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?  
Maybe we forgot, are we awake, or not?  
Maybe we forgot  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm at my weakest  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Stop my fall  
Every time you go  
Tape me up  
Then break me up  
Ever so gently  
When I'm at my weakest  
It's not so hard  
Every time you go
