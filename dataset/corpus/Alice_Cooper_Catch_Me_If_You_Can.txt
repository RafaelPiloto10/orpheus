She was not the first  
And he won't be my last  
My hunger and my thirst  
My brilliant future  
And my ugly past  
  
They'll all be here with me  
'Til my web is spun  
My blessing and my curse  
There'll be no rest  
Until my work is done  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself  
  
You won't have a clue  
Of what is coming next  
What I'm gonna do  
Surely classical in its effect  
  
Which limb will I choose?  
Which one gets sawn in half?  
Which leg would you lose?  
To an arachnophobic psychopath  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
I wrestled with the devil and I'll do it again  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself, I can't control myself  
  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
Catch me, catch me if you can  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again  
  
Catch me, catch me when you can  
I can't control myself, I just can't control myself  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again  
  
I wrestled with the devil and I'll do it again  
I'm scheming with the demons and I'll do it again
