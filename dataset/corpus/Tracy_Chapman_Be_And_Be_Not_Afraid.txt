I believe in mistakes and accidents  
That the nature of life is chaos and confusion  
That man's rules of law and order  
May not stand  
  
And I should be and be not afraid  
To reach for heaven  
  
I may think that I know  
The true heart's needs  
But my pride may bring me low  
Unable to see  
I'm no closer than yesterday  
But tomorrow I may stand  
  
And be and be not afraid  
To reach for heaven  
  
I'll see the black car cavalcade  
Lights on in the morn  
I'll run fast and far away  
I'll run without stopping  
Til hear and feet fail  
Or until I can stand  
  
And be and be not afraid  
  
Be and be not afraid  
Be and be not afraid  
To reach for heaven
