When I walk through deep waters  
I know that You will be with me  
When I'm standing in the fire  
I will not be overcome  
Through the valley of the shadow  
I will not fear  
  
I am not alone  
I am not alone  
You will go before me  
You will never leave me [2x]  
  
In the midst of deep sorrow  
I see Your light is breaking through  
The dark of night will not overtake me  
I am pressing into You  
Lord, You fight my every battle  
And I will not fear  
  
I am not alone  
I am not alone  
You will go before me  
You will never leave me [2x]  
  
You amaze me  
Redeem me  
You call me as Your own [4x]  
  
You're my strength  
You're my defender  
You're my refuge in the storm  
Through these trials  
You've always been faithful  
You bring healing to my soul  
  
I am not alone  
I am not alone  
You will go before me  
You will never leave me [3x]
