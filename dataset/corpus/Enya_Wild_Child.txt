Ever close your eyes  
Ever stop and listen  
Ever feel alive  
And you've nothing missing  
You don't need a reason  
Let the day go on and on  
  
Let the rain fall down  
Everywhere around you  
Give into it now  
Let the day surround you  
You don't need a reason  
Let the rain go on and on  
  
[Chorus]  
What a day, what a day to take to  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child  
  
Only take the time  
From the helter skelter  
Every day you find  
Everything's in kilter  
You don't need a reason  
Let the day go on and on  
  
Every summer sun  
Every winter evening  
Every spring to come  
Every autumn leaving  
You don't need a reason  
Let it all go on and on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What a day, what a day to take to  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
What a day, what a day to take to  
  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
  
What a way, what a way to make it through  
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child  
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
