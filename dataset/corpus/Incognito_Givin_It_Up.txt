I've taken time to say goodbye to my sadness  
But now I know I'm free  
You took my hand and led me out of the darkness  
To help me find a brand new me (Baby)  
Though all the world around me criticized  
The love you gave was never compromised  
  
I never heard you say through all of the madness  
Maybe, maybe  
There's no denyin' I feel the same way too  
Baby, I would die for you (Yeah)  
I would (Die for you)  
With you I know I'm in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it all up to the feelin'  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Baby, I know you've got that somethin'  
(Givin it up)  
  
Learning the truth, that exposed me to my blindness  
Has opened up my world  
Gone are the barriers that kept me out in darkness  
Living in a twilight world  
You guided me, where others feared to tread  
And through it all no grudging words were said  
  
I never heard you say through all of this madness  
Maybe, maybe  
There's no denial I feel the same way too  
Honey, I would die for you  
I would (Die for you)  
With you I know I'm in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it all up to the feelin'  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
Give it up!  
I want to give it up!  
  
There's no denial I feel the same way too  
Baby, I would die for you (Yes)  
I would (Die for you)  
With you I know I'm in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it all up to the feelin'  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
That's why, I'm givin' it all up to you, Baby!
