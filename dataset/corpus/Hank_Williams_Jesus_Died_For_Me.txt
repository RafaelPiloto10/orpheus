When everything goes wrong and it seems all hope is gone  
I remember how my Savior died, He died there on the cross  
So, this world would not be lost, Jesus died for me long ago  
Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away  
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name  
Jesus died for me long ago  
What pain He suffered there, the holy one, so dear  
So that you and I could live, I'll try to repay  
For His sufferin' on that day, Jesus died for me long ago  
Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away  
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name  
Jesus died for me long ago  
As He hung there all alone, His life's blood almost gone  
He never stopped prayin' for me, so I'll follow all the way  
And live with Him someday, Jesus died for me long ago  
Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away  
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name  
Jesus died for me long ago, Jesus died for me
