A cowboy return to the scene of his childhood  
To his sweetheart of long long ago  
But today he returns she was wed to another  
Tells the story of heartbreak and woe  
  
Cowboy ridin'  
Sorrow hidin'  
Head bowed lonesome and blue  
Church bells ringin'  
  
Boy sat singin'  
Someone sayin' adieu  
Love's old sweet song  
Was never meant to turn out wrong  
  
Even in a cowboy's song 'bout old pal  
I guess we strayed too long  
Yes sir, heaven bless her  
Either caress her  
  
As we ride the heartbreak trail  
(Love's old sweet song...  
Was never meant to turn out wrong.)
