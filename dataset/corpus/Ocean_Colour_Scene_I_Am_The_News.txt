I am the news and I'll say no more  
I am the stranger at your door  
I am the the deep beneath the sea  
The threat of flood tide rising  
I am the banks bearing refugees  
Always a cause not solution  
A constant fear or a fleeting joy  
Your only friend who needs using  
  
I am the news and I'm in your face  
And I'll take my profit from your faith  
I am the the face beneath the face  
The catalyst of explosions  
I am the crop bearing crippled genes  
I am an inside connection  
A constant friend on a changing screen  
Your history and direction  
  
Radio, radio  
I'll turn you on again  
You're the truth  
You're a soothe  
Be the blues  
Be my best friend  
Don't give us the truth  
I need the news again  
  
I am the news and I'm every spin  
I am what is and what's not in  
I am the trump card, I'm the ace  
I am the news and I'm in your face  
I am the ocean's biggest roar  
I am the smallest twist of fate  
I am the ending of a play  
I am the opening curtain  
  
I am the crop bearing crippled genes  
I am an inside connection  
A constant friend on a changing screen  
Your history and direction
