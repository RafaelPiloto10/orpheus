She shines  
In a world full of ugliness  
She matters when everything is meaningless  
  
Fragile  
She doesn't see her beauty  
She tries to get away  
Sometimes  
It's just that nothing seems worth saving  
I can't watch her slip away  
  
I won't let you fall apart  
  
She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by  
Hoping someone can see  
If I could fix myself I'd - but it's too late for me  
  
I wont let you fall apart  
  
We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide  
I'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side  
...but they keep waiting  
...and picking...  
  
It's something I have to do  
I was there, too  
Before everything else  
I was like you
