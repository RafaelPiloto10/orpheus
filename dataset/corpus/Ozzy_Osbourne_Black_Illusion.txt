You load the dice and paint the smile upon your face  
With fingers crossed you switch the perfume with the mace  
What kind of dreams to you enjoy inside your bed  
I'll face the lies and shake the evil from your head  
  
Black Illusion  
Is all I ever see  
Black Illusion  
I bring you misery  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
You always seem to know the answer to it all  
You seem to cheat the truth and never take the fall  
Your life is hollow and you simply the rules  
The time will come when you will join the other fools  
  
Black Illusion  
Is all I ever see  
Black Illusion  
I bring you misery  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
I load the dice and fake a smile upon my face  
With fingers crossed I switch the perfume with the mace  
What kind of dreams do I enjoy inside my bed  
You'll face the lies and shake the evil from my head  
  
Black Illusion  
Is all I ever see  
Black Illusion  
I bring you misery  
Oh yeah  
Yeah
