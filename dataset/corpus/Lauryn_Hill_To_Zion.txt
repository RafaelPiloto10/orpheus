Unsure of what the balance held  
I touched my belly overwhelmed  
By what I had been chosen to perform  
But then an angel came one day  
Told me to kneel down and pray  
For unto me a man child would be born  
Woe this crazy circumstance  
I knew his life deserved a chance  
But everybody told me to be smart  
Look at your career they said  
Lauryn, baby use your head  
But instead I chose to use my heart  
  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
  
How beautiful if nothing more  
Than to wait at Zion's door  
I've never been in love like this before  
Now let me pray to keep you from  
The perils that will surely come  
See life for you my prince has just begun  
And I thank you for choosing me  
To come through unto life to be  
A beautiful reflection of his grace  
For I know that a gift so great  
Is only one god could create  
And I'm reminded every time I see your face  
  
That the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
Now the joy of my world is in Zion  
  
Marching, marching, marching to Zion  
Marching, marching  
Marching, marching, marching to Zion  
Beautiful, beautiful Zion
