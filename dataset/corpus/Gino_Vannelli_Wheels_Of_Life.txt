The wheels of life are turning so much faster  
The restless hands of time pass me by  
There are dreams I'll never live to see  
But as long as you believe in me  
I'll still feel them on the way  
As I take life day by day  
  
Oh the wheels of time are turning so much stronger  
The blues of days gone by weigh me down  
But maybe love will come to rescue me  
And I'll never set you free  
Like the sea runs to the shore  
I've come back yo you once more  
  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life keep turning round and round  
  
And if I should only have one tomorrow  
It's a lifetime if I knew  
I could spend that day with you  
  
Ooh, the wheels of love will turn my world forever  
I want you in my arms for all time  
And maybe love will come to rescue me  
And I'll never ever set you free  
Like the sea runs to the shore  
I'll love you forever more  
  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life keep turning round and round  
  
The wheels of life  
The wheels of life keep turning so much faster  
The wheels of life are turning so much stronger
