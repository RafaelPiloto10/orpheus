Every now and then we all want something  
Even if there's no way of gettin' it  
If i stomach that that's the way it must be  
Be the way around it, could I get myself around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
  
don't want to always have to be so nice  
don't want to hear you say well that's just life  
I dry out when I open my mouth  
I make my way around it, make my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  
  
I'm not about to take no for an answer  
no  
If I tell you I can't I'm still gonna go  
I did it all by myself  
I found my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  
  
It's not to lovely  
It could start to get ugly  
It really bugs me  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want
