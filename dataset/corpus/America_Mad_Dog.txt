Through the darkness I see you again  
Watch my temperature rise  
Can't believe my eyes, don't tell me  
I've had way too much tonight  
  
Drank the potion stronger than me  
Got me all confused  
Why you so amused, don't tell me  
You've had way too much tonight  
  
Please don't tell me no  
God, I miss you so  
One thing you should know  
God, I love you so, oh  
  
Had way too much tonight  
I'm a mad dog at times like these  
Don't know where to turn  
Ain't the time to learn my lesson  
I've had way too much tonight  
  
Ain't the time to learn my lesson  
I've had way too much to-  
Really too much to-  
I've had way too much tonight  
Alright  
  
I've had way too much to-  
Really too much to-  
I've had way too much tonight
