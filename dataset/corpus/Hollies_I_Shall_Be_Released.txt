Any day now, any way now  
I shall be released  
They say every thing can be replaced  
Yet every distance is not near  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any way now  
I shall be released  
They say every man needs protection  
They say that every man must fall  
Yet I swear, I see my reflection  
Somewhere so high above this wall  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any way now  
I shall be released  
Standin' next to me in this lonely crowd  
A man who swears he's not to blame  
All day long, I hear him shoutin' so loud  
Cryin' out that he was framed  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any way now  
I shall be released  
Any day now, any way now  
I shall be released
