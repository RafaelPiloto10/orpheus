You're a soul with no religion  
There's ice in your embrace  
In your dance of indecision  
I see the anger in yor face  
A little drink to help my vision  
A little something for the pain  
There's no drug for my condition  
There's no sweetness in the taste.  
  
Tell me where the ride's gonna lead you  
Do I have to pay to be your friend?  
There's nothing left to say  
When you slipped away.  
  
I can see you fading fast  
I won't let you take me  
When you slipped away  
I can see your burning stare  
Nothing's gonna shake me  
As you slip away  
  
You're a world of blind ambition  
Staring through the looking glass  
You will meet your own collision  
When your conscience comes to ask.  
  
Steal the love from those around you  
Help yourself to everything  
Take the shelter that surrounds you  
It leaves you standing in the rain.  
  
Tell me if the money can heal you  
Do I have to pray to make it end?  
There's nothing left to say when you slipped away.  
  
I can see you fading fast  
I won't let you take me  
When you slipped away  
I can see your burning stare  
Nothing's gonna shake me  
As you slip away  
As you slip away
