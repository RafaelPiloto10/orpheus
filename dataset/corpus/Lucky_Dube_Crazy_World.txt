So far so good we still living today  
But we don't know what tomorrow brings  
In this crazy world  
People dying like flies every day  
You read about it in the news  
But you don't believe it  
You'll only know about it  
When the man in the long black coat  
Knocks on your door  
'Cause you're his next victim  
As you are living in this  
  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
  
Leaders starting wars every time they want  
Some for their rights,  
Some for fun and their own glory letting people die for the wrong that they do  
Oh it's painful come on now little boy  
Say your prayers before you sleep  
Little boy went down on his knees  
And he said  
  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world  
Living in, living in this crazy world
