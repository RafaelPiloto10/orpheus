And I'd like to take you take you away  
And if you'd come with me we'd leave here today  
There's nothing to hold you as strong as this feeling  
And I've got to have you as soon as I can  
  
And I know you're worried about where you stand  
The ring that he gave you is still on your hand  
You want to be faithful you want to believe  
He's easy to lie to but hard to deceive  
And you say it's over between you and him  
He tells you he needs you but chances are slim  
That he even wants you as much as I do  
So why don't you go on and tell him you're through  
Cause I'd like to take you  
And I'd like to take you  
And I've got to have you as soon as I can as soon as I can
