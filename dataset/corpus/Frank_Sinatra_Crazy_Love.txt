Crazy love, people say I'm crazy in love.  
Just a fool, sighing sighs to the skies up above  
It isn't normal or real, to feel heaven's right inside your door.  
But somehow that's how I feel, and I've never felt this way before.  
  
Crazy dreams, keep me clinging to this affair.  
I'm insane to keep dreaming that you could care.  
But I am a kind of a fool who stayed after school.  
  
I've learned my lessons well,  
And if this crazy love is such a crazy love, I'm glad I fell.
