Well I'm calling you  
'Cause you deserve to know  
You are not the reason that I had to go,  
Late at night in these hotel rooms  
I think of all I've lost,  
What I've put you through  
  
And if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to  
  
I've got a guilty heart  
And a troubled mind  
No matter where I go  
You're never far behind  
I'd like to think  
That you've forgiven me  
But forgiveness ain't enough  
To wash my conscience clean  
  
Oh and if I knew the reason  
I would tell you why somehow  
The feeling slipped away  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to  
  
I only did what I had to do  
Not 'cause I wanted to
