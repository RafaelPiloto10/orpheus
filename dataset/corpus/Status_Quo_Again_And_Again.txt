Once upon a time not so very long ago  
There wasn't such a thing as a rock'n roll show  
You had to sit at home and listen to the radio  
  
Then came a man with a rockin'guitar  
Found himself a beat and he played it near and far  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
He travelled round the world in a rock-n-roll band  
He stood there like a giant with a guitar in his hand  
Everybody danced and sang and let the good times roll  
  
Nobody cared about the clothes he would wear  
Nobody cared about the colour of his hair  
Everybody came to see and let the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
Now we've got the rhythm in us now we've got the rock  
Time didn't matter never living by the clock  
Everybody came to hear him playing his rock-n-roll  
  
Then came a line when the music didn't rhyme  
He couldn't find the rhythm 'cause he couldn't find the time  
But still the people came to listen to the good times roll  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Again again again again, again again again again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again  
Why don't you do it, why don't you do it again
