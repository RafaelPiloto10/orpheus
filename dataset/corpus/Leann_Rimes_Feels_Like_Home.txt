In your eyes I find the answers to my questions  
In your arms, yeah, I found the world I've waited for  
In your touch I've found everything I ever needed  
I need nothing more  
  
Always dreamed of the day when  
my dream would find me  
Now my dream's beside me  
You are in my life  
  
In your arms I know where I belong  
I've never known this feeling, oh  
But it feels like home  
In your eyes I know what I can be  
You opened up your heart to me  
And it feels like home  
When I'm with you baby  
It feels like home.  
  
All this time there was not much to believe in  
I kept my faith, yeah, that you were waiting there for me  
I searched this world  
And now my search is finally over  
I found what I believed  
Always hoped for the day  
When my heart would find you  
Now my heart's beside you  
You are in my life  
  
In your arms I know where I belong  
I've never known this feeling, oh  
But it feels like home  
In your eyes I know what I can be  
You've opened up your heart to me  
Oh, and it feels like home  
  
It doesn't matter where I've been  
Or what I've been through  
Cause I know I've been waiting  
Every day of my life  
To be with you, to be with you  
  
In your arms I know where I belong  
I've never known this feeling before  
But it feels like home  
In your eyes I know what I can be  
You've opened up your heart to me, oh  
And it feels like home  
  
When I'm with you baby, it feels like home  
When I'm with you baby, it feels like home  
Feels like home, feels like home  
Feels like home, feels like home  
Feels like home, feels like home  
It feels like home
