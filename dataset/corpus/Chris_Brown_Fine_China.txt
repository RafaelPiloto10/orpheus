Baby,  
Does he do it for you  
When he's finished, does he step back, and adore you  
I just gotta know,  
'Cause your time is money and I won't let him  
Waste it, oh no, no  
Baby,  
Just go with it  
'Cause when you're with me, I can't explain it,  
It's just different  
We can take it slow  
Or act like you're my girl let's skip the basics,  
Oh woah  
  
He's so replaceable  
You're worth the chase, you put it on  
  
It's alright,  
I'm not dangerous  
When you're mine,  
I'll be generous  
You're irreplaceable, a collectible  
Just like fine china  
  
Favorite,  
You're my favorite  
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces  
And the saying goes  
Life is just a game but I'm not playin'  
Whoah oh  
  
He's so replaceable  
You're worth the chase, you put it on  
  
It's alright, I'm not dangerous  
When you're mine, I'll be generous  
You're irreplaceable  
A collectible, (Just like)

It's alright,  
I'm not dangerous  
When you're mine,

You're irreplaceable a collectible,  
Just like fine china  
  
Give me a weapon, your love  
Ain't no amount of time, in this world  
Save me a lot of time, and just love me  
Feel it baby, feel it in your soul  
Are you ready?  
I know your heart's been telling you belong me  
  
Ah na na no  
  
It's alright,

You're irreplaceable a collectible,  
Just like fine china
