They call me Junior  
I live here on the street  
I earn two hundred dollars a week  
I'd like to say  
"Hey, thanks a lot"  
I know I'm missin' something  
But I don't know what it is  
That I don't got  
  
I sit here watchin'  
The people down below  
I try to imagine  
The places they may go  
I don't know  
I stay home a lot  
I know I'm missin' something  
But I don't know what it is  
That I don't got  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
I'm afraid of everything  
From golden rules to airplanes  
What a small little man I am  
  
They call me Junior  
I'm caught up in this hell  
Sometimes I feel better  
But I never do feel well.  
Jesus must have one hell of a plan for me  
I know I'm missin' something  
But I don't know what it is  
That I don't got  
  
And if I have anything to say  
About judgement day  
There'll be a crown in heaven  
For those who live this way  
Anyway  
You know exactly who you are  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
I'm afraid of everything  
From the golden rule to airplanes  
What a small little man I am  
  
They call me Junior  
I live here on the street  
I earn two hundred dollars a week  
I'd like to say  
"Hey man, thanks a lot"  
My name is Junior  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
I'm afraid of everything  
From the golden rule to airplanes  
What a small little man I am
