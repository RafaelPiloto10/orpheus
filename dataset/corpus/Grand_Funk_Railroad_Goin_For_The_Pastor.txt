I've been in love for a short time.  
I had a little trouble makin' up my mind.  
Somthin' got in my way, babe.  
I find it really hard for me to say.  
I know that my head was hot, girl.  
Hot enough to hit the spot that makes you trot.  
But, girl I ain't no liar.  
Gonna' set your little heart on fire. yeah.  
  
I've had my hit and miss, girl.  
I'm ready now to settle right down to this.  
I hope that your love is true, babe.  
As true as the love I hold for you.  
There's one thing that I'd say, girl.  
I love you for ever and a day.  
Now, girl I ain't no liar.  
I'm gonna' set your little heart on fire. yeah.  
  
(chorus)  
'cause when I'm thinking of you.  
Thinkin' about you.  
My heart beats faster I'm goin' for the pastor.  
I got me a love and I'm gonna' make it last, girl.  
Girl.  
'cause when I think about you.  
Thinkin' about you.  
My heart beats faster I'm goin' for the pastor.  
I got me a love and I'm gonna' make it last, girl.  
  
Ohhhhh ...  
  
I really think you're brave, babe.  
For cuttin' loose that bloodthirsty dave the knave.  
Now davey, his love was strong, babe.  
But, you're better off with a love that's long.  
You never have to be alone, girl.  
'cause I'll be there when you come back home.  
Now, girl I ain't no liar.  
I'm gonna' set your little heart on fire. ahh, ohh ...  
  
(chorus)
