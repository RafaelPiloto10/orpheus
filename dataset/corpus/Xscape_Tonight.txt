Come a little bit closer and look into my eyes,  
If only for a moment, boy don't be surprised.  
I want you right here next to me,  
So tell me we can spend some time.  
  
So I can hold you softly,  
In these gentle arms of mine.  
And the moonlight's gazing,ooh,  
Shining on my window pane,  
  
Beaming down on the midnight hour,  
I hear the sound of rain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tonight, tonight, ooh...  
Tonight, tonight, ooh...  
  
So why don't you stay awhile,  
I can't help it if you put me in a daze boy.  
But you look so good to me,  
In your satin PJs.  
  
So let's make love by candlelight,  
And listen to the quiet storm.  
As I kiss you in the places,  
That make your body warm.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
I'm holding you  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Holding you tight all through the night  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Looks like it's gonna rain  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Holding you tight all through the night  
  
Tonight.
