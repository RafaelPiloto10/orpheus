[Chorus]  
In the night, I hear 'em talk,  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..  
How could you be so heartless?  
Oh, how could you be so heartless?  
  
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo  
Just remember that you talkin' to me though  
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo  
I mean after all the things that we've been through  
I mean after all the things we got into  
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me  
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me  
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me  
So you walk around like you don't know me  
You got a new friend, well I got homies  
But in the end it's still so lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know  
I decided we weren't goin' speak so  
Why we up three A.M. on the phone  
Why does she be so mad at me for  
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold  
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up  
Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me  
They say that they don't see what you see in me  
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
You'll never find nobody better than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk  
Baby let's just knock it off  
They don't know what we been through  
They don't know 'bout me and you  
So I got something new to see  
And you just goin' keep hatin' me  
And we just goin' be enemies  
I know you can't believe  
I could just leave it wrong  
And you can't make it right  
I'm goin' take off tonight  
Into the night  
  
[Chorus]
