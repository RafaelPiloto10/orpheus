Girl, don't you know it's all I can do  
To keep my hands off of you  
Anytime you're around  
And when the stars come out at night  
I dream of holdin' you tight  
Every time I lay down  
It feels so good to me to have you this bad  
The only other thing I wish I had was  
  
A chance  
A chance  
To tell you how I feel about you  
How it feels to live without a chance  
A chance  
To tell you I'll love you forever  
Knowing that I'll never have a chance  
  
Sometimes reality hurts  
And you wonder if life's worth living at all  
Knowing no matter how much you care  
You'll never have a prayer  
Of having what you want  
At least I've been close enough I could taste  
Beauty at it's best but never a trace of  
  
A chance  
A chance  
To tell you how I feel about you  
How it feels to live without a chance  
A chance  
To tell you I'll love you forever  
Knowing that I'll never have a chance  
  
A chance  
A chance  
To tell you I'll love you forever  
Knowing that I'll never have  
The chance
