When I heard that familiar voice,  
My heart stopped dead in it's tracks.  
Across the room I could see him there,  
A ghost from my past.  
But he's too caught up to notice me.  
She must be his new love.  
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much,  
It's just  
  
I know how he feels.  
How warm his touch is.  
Oh how he feels.  
How soft his kiss is.  
And it cuts right down to the bone  
Cause I let him go.  
I know how he cares.  
How strong his love can be,  
When he believes it's real.  
Oh I've been there.  
I know how he feels.  
  
As long as I kept him out of site,  
I kept from going out of my mind.  
Tried to believe that leaving him was some how justified.  
But tonight there's no denying what a love like his is worth  
He once looked at me the way he's looking at her.  
What a lucky girl.
