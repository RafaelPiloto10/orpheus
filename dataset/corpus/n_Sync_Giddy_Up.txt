(Gotta giddy up)  
Yeah, 'N Sync, giddy up  
(Gotta giddy up)  
Like this, come on  
  
Tried to get a hold of you last night  
(Called you on the phone)  
Thinking to myself something ain't right  
Girl were you alone  
Letting little things come between us  
(All we do is fuss)  
When all I want to do is show you love  
  
[Chorus]  
So I say  
(Hold up) I'm tired of all these lies, yeah yeah  
(Hold up) And if you want to make things right, that's right  
(Hold up) I'm tired of all these lies  
(Hold up) 'Cause if you want to make things right  
  
You've got to giddy up  
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now  
(Giddy up, giddy up)  
I gotta giddy up, giddy up  
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now, yeah  
(Giddy up, giddy up, gotta giddy up)  
  
Remembering the way we used to be  
(Everything was cool)  
And now you've gone and done all this to me, babe (to me)  
Maybe we can turn this love around  
(Give it one more try)  
You see, every time you're thinking about saying goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've got to  
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now  
(Giddy up, giddy up)  
I gotta giddy up  
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now  
(Giddy up, giddy up, gotta giddy up)  
  
Yeah, ride...giddy up, giddy up yeah  
Ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it  
Ride it, ride it, ride it  
Giddy up, giddy up  
  
You got to, you got to  
You got to giddy giddy up  
You got to, you got to  
You got to giddy giddy up  
  
You've got to giddy up  
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now  
(Giddy up, giddy up)  
I gotta giddy up, giddy up  
(Giddy up, giddy up) Giddy up now, yeah  
(Giddy up, giddy up, gotta giddy up)  
  
Ride it, ride it, ride it  
Giddy up
