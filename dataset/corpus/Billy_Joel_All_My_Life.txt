All my life, I've searched this whole world through  
Try as I might, to find someone like you  
The years drifted by, but it was always on my mind  
I didn't know how long I'd go, until I ran out of time  
  
All my life, I've hurt the ones who cared  
One by one, no loving heart was spared  
I've been a wild and restless man, but still a man who needs a wife  
That was my dream and now it seems you've taken all my life  
  
For as long as I could my intentions were good  
I assumed my affairs would be fine  
But I know very well, there's a long road to hell  
That's been paved with intentions like mine  
  
All my life, I've paid for my mistakes  
After a while, the strongest spirit breaks  
I've had heartache and pain, it cut me deeper than a knife  
But those days are done, 'cause you're the one I've wanted all my life  
  
And I know very well, there's a long road to hell  
That's been paved with intentions like mine  
All my life, my stars were surely crossed  
Now and then, I missed the love I lost  
But all that changed, the day you said you'd be my wife  
  
Who could have known that finding you  
Would only take me all my life
