I want to make myself complete  
I want to hold it in my arms  
I want this blow to scar your eyes  
I want this pain to go away  
I want to shake this thinking here  
I wish there was a heaven  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell  
  
You want to write my name in blood  
You want to carve it in my arm  
You want to make yourself a dream  
You want this world under your thumb  
You want to make me shout and scream  
We know there ain't no heaven  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell  
  
And we all know it well...  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell
