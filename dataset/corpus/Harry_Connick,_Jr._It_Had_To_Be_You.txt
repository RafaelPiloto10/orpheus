It had to be you  
It had to be you  
I wandered around and finally found  
  
The somebody who could make me be true  
Could make me be blue or even be glad  
Just to be sad just thinking of you  
  
Some others I've seen might never be mean  
Might never be cross or try to be boss  
But they wouldn't do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill  
  
With all your faults I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you  
It had to be you
