One look in your innocent eyes  
And I knew you had to be the one  
You walked out of all of my dreams  
Never thought the day would really come  
  
I've been standing in a long desperate line  
Waiting for somebody like you  
I may only be wasting my time  
Don't know what else to do  
  
If you turn me away  
Just be careful what you say  
Girl, you've got my heart on the line  
Don't be mean, don't be cruel  
Don't you treat me like a fool  
Girl, you've got my heart on the line  
  
It's too late to be wishing I was  
In somebody else's shoes this time  
I'm tied up, like a slave to a chain  
Praying that you'll please be kind  
  
If it's true that love's a disease  
Baby, I'm a dangerous case  
I beg for mercy, got me down on my knees  
You've got a smile on your face  
  
If you turn me away  
Just be careful what you say  
Girl, you've got my heart on the line  
Don't be mean, don't be cruel  
Don't you treat me like a fool  
Girl, you've got my heart on the line  
  
I don't want to stay  
In my own little world  
So if you want to play  
Won't you show me, little girl  
  
If you turn me away  
Just be careful what you say  
Girl, you've got my heart on the line  
Don't be mean, don't be cruel  
Don't you treat me like a fool  
Girl, you've got my heart on the line
