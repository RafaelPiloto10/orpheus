There are nights made out of magic  
Magic nights when dreams come true  
Nights like that fall on anybody  
Even me and you  
  
Think we're gonna have one tonight  
We're gonna have one of those nights  
We're gonna have one of those times  
One of those times of our lives  
Baby, tonight in this world  
There's gonna be just you and me  
We're gonna be falling in love  
Baby, just you wait and see  
We're gonna have one of those nights  
  
So kill the lights and light the candles  
Turn your favorite station on  
Sometime tonight no matter what they're playin'  
They'll be playin' our song  
  
Think we're gonna have one tonight  
We're gonna have one of those nights  
We're gonna have one of those times  
One of those times of our lives  
Baby, tonight in this world  
There's gonna be just you and me  
We're gonna be falling in love  
Baby, just you wait and see  
We're gonna have one of those nights  
  
Nights of magic midnight blue  
Everybody is allowed a few  
  
Think we're gonna have one tonight  
We're gonna have one of those nights  
One of those star-spangled nights  
We're gonna have one of those times  
One of those times of our lives  
Baby, tonight in this world  
There's gonna be just you and me  
We're gonna be falling in love  
Baby, just you wait and see  
One of those nights  
One of those nights  
Oh, we're gonna have one of those nights  
One of those nights  
One of those nights  
One of those nights
