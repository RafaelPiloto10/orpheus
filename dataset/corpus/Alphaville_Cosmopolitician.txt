I sleep between the gates of night, in a no man's land  
Always closer than you think, a kind of your best friend  
I have no religion and I have no flag  
I don't care if you're wrong or right  
Lilac skinned or black  
  
I'm a cosmopolitician  
Closer than your next of kin  
Angel, devil of the night  
And the seed of everything  
  
And if your world has turned to ashes  
I will leave you never  
Even when the sun's blown out, I will shine forever  
I caress you with my charms  
I'm your best friend, the dream  
I'm the light that guides you through the nights  
And deepest haze  
  
I'm a cosmopolitician...  
  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around  
Are you awake or do you dream  
You're stuck inside a frozen scene  
You try to move but there's no moves  
You try to speak but there's no use  
You try to wake but you can't  
You close your eyes without a chance  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around..
