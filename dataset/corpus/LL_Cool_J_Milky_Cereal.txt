Oh yeah  
Hey yo, man  
Ain't nothin' like a nice bowl of cornflakes in the morning  
To smooth you out  
  
Milky cereal  
(Baby)  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Who's the baddest female of them all?  
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl  
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul  
Rich female, very debonair  
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair  
We was hangin out, pumpin' the stereo  
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's  
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle  
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles  
A guy walked over, said, "Your earring's cute."  
I said, "I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop."  
Me and Frosted went to get a drink  
But she ordered somethin' bugged, and I ain't know what to think  
She ordered potassium, calcium  
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium  
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch  
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth  
She's  
  
[Chorus]  
Milky cereal  
(Baby)  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm  
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm  
For some reason, we walked in the rain  
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain  
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real  
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal  
So we went to be alone  
But we had to be quiet, 'cause her corn pops was home  
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms  
I said "Forget it, let me see your lucky charms."  
When we began, her hairstyle was neat  
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat  
Talked about marriage, I said "That's risky  
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies"  
She had a robe with the velour material  
Her pops woke up, I said "Hello Mr. Cereal  
I came this morning to deliver the paper."  
He said "Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors  
That's my daughter, so save your croonin'  
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, check this out here  
  
Then there was Pebbles, times was rough  
She was turnin' tricks to get her "coo-coo puff!"  
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact  
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat  
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks  
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks  
We called him Hungry Jack  
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack  
He invited me out to lunch  
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch  
The waiter said, "Jack, what would you like today?"  
He said "I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?"  
He said "Cool," came back with the order  
That's when I said, "Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter."  
He said "Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?"  
I said "Nah, I want to ride in a Mercedes  
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing  
'Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King."  
He said "Go party, do some minglin'  
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin'"  
I said "It's smooth, no disrespect  
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week cheque."  
Then we walked down the aisle  
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style  
  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Milky  
  
Peace!
