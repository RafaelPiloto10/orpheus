Debt  
On my head  
Wasting time  
On my own  
  
Sleep  
Rescue me  
Take me back  
To my home  
  
[Chorus:]  
For the times  
That you want to go and  
Bust rhymes real slow  
I'll appear  
Slap you on the face and  
Enjoy the show  
  
Cheese  
Smells so good  
On a burnt  
Piece of lamb  
  
Fag  
Of the year  
Who could beat  
Up your man?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohhhh  
This dope nose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohhhh  
This dope nose
