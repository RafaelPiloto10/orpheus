Love has truly been good to me  
Not even one sad day  
Or minute I had since you come my way  
I hope you know I gladly go  
Anywhere you take me  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above  
  
Got to tell you how you thrill me  
I'm happy as I can be  
You have come and changed my whole world  
Bye bye sadness hello mellow  
What a wonderful day  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above  
  
And it's so amazing, so amazing  
I could stay forever, forever  
I would leave you never, never  
Cause we go amazing love  
Truly it's amazing, so amazing  
Love brought us together, together  
I would leave you never, never  
Cause we got amazing love  
  
So amazing and I've been waiting  
For a love like you  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above
