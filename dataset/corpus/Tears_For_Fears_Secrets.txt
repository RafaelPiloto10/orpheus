It seems we caused a forest fire  
With just a flicker of a flame  
And now I set alight to everything  
Now all I do is cause you pain  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child  
  
I used to think the time would come  
When man would rise above the beast  
I gave up thinking that way long ago  
In conversation with a priest  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child  
  
We could have heal this blindness  
With some human kindness  
I know secrets kill you  
But my love can fill you  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
  
It would be so fine  
If you could be mine  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child
