Man's atomic age is here  
Horrifying hordes appear  
Exoskeleton armored, exoskeleton might  
Exoskeleton horror, exoskeleton bite  
  
Beware of them!  
Beware of them!  
  
Something wicked this way comes  
Creepy crawling giant bugs  
Exoskeleton armored, exoskeleton might  
Exoskeleton horror, exoskeleton bite  
  
Beware of them!  
Beware of them!  
  
In the desert sands where they test the bombs came these man-made monsters  
They'll try to breed, they'll fly by night  
We must destroy these nests of mutant ants, these man-made monsters  
Their bodies burn a gruesome sight  
  
Beware of them!  
Beware of them!  
  
Evil is as humans do  
Bible prophecy comes true  
  
In the desert sands where they test the bombs came these man-made monsters  
They'll try to breed, they'll fly by night  
We must destroy these nests of mutant ants, these man-made monsters  
Their bodies burn a gruesome sight  
Their bodies burn a gruesome sight  
  
Beware of them!  
Beware of them!  
Beware of them!  
Beware of them!
