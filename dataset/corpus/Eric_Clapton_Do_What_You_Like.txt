Do right, use your head.  
Everybody must be fed.  
Get together, break your bread.  
Yes, together, that's what I said.  
Do what you like.  
  
Don't fight, use your head.  
It's all right every night.  
Do what you like, that's what I said.  
Everybody must be fed.  
Do what you like.  
  
Open your eyes.  
Realize you're not dead.  
Take a look at an open book.  
Do what you like, that's what I said.  
Do what you like.
