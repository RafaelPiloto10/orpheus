Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?  
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?  
No desire, no ambition leads me  
Maybe it's because nobody needs me  
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?  
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?  
Maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear  
  
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?  
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?  
No desire, no ambition leads me  
Maybe it's because nobody needs me  
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?  
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?  
Maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear
