Gomen nasai I'm so sorry gomen nasai  
I am so sorry I made you cry  
Won't you forgive me dear  
Goman nasai nights have been lonely  
My days are blue, because I made a fool of you  
Won't you forgive me dear  
My butterfly heart has brought you pain  
Won't you forgive won't you forget  
Let's be sweethearts again  
Goman nasai nights would be heaven  
Love fill my days  
If you'd believe me when I say  
I love you gomen nasai  
I love you gomen nasai  
I love you gomen nasai
