If I give my love to you girl, will I get love in return?  
Or will I just get a fire, for as long as it will burn  
I'm not looking for a lover, I don't even want a friend  
I want this to last forever, and forever never ends  
  
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away  
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you don't love me  
If this is just a game, well honey I don't think I really care to play  
  
I've trusted you before, babe and you always let me down  
I came back to you believing, I was more than just a clown  
You say it will be different, this time your love is real  
Honey don't make me believe you, if that ain't the way you feel  
  
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away  
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you don't love me  
If this is just a game, well honey I don't think I really care to play  
  
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away  
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you don't love me
