Kid's gettin' tired, hangin' around  
So cocksure, thinkin' aloud  
Can't get it in, can't get it out  
Sure ain't enough and there ain't no doubt  
Can't stop a train with just a smile  
Stop me at the start only for a while  
Hole in my pocket, hole in my arm  
All that's left when life's lost it's charm  
This could be for us just any other day  
Come on girl, we've really got to get away  
It's the only chance you'll ever have to change  
Stickin' in this city will drive you insane  
Kid's gettin' tired, hangin' around  
So cocksure, thinkin' aloud  
Can't get it in, can't get out  
Sure ain't enough and there ain't no doubt  
Can't win or lose when there's little left to choose  
Now 'til next year it'll always be the same  
The black back streets and people  
Who don't know your name  
Go with the wind, it'll only carry us away
