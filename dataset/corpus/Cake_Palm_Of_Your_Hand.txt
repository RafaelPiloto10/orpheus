When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed it  
When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed  
The bricks and mortar  
Have all given way  
At first they resisted but then they began to sway  
How can you say forever is at your command  
How can you say the future's in the palm  
In the palm of your hand  
  
When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed it  
When the house was standing  
You'd never have believed  
That gaping hole was once a foundation  
Where you stand now were tools in the basement  
How can you say forever is at your command  
How can you say the future in the palm  
In the palm of your hand
