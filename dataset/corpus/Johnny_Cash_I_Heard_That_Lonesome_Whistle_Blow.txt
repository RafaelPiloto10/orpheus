I was riding number nine  
Heading South from Caraloine  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
I got in trouble, had to roam  
I left my gal an' left my home  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
Just a kid, actin' smart  
I went and broke my darling's heart  
I guess I was too young to know  
  
They took me off the Georgia Main  
Locked me to a ball and chain  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All alone I bear the shame  
I'm a number, not a name  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All I do is sit an' cry  
When that evenin' train goes by  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
An' my hair turns whiter than snow  
  
I'll never see that gal of mine  
I'm in Georgia, doin' time  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
