In West Philadelphia I was born and raised  
On the playground is where I spent most of my days  
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,  
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school  
  
When a couple of guys who where up to no good  
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,  
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bell air".
