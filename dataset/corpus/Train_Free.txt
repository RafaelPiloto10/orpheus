Staring at the dark again, you left your silhouette upon my pillow  
Right inside the night, I'm waiting for the light, seems like  
I'm in the middle  
Workin' for something that I can't touch and sometimes  
Can't even believe in woah  
Cradled by the hands of fate the faith that  
Sometimes wraps around too tight so tight  
They call me free but I call me a fool  
They call me free but I call me a fool  
Well I look back at April, but she won't look back at me  
No, no, no  
So I pray in May for June to stay, but she just came  
To wash into the sea away  
They call me free nut I call me a fool  
  
Slipped down to Mexico, started messin' with her yellow afro  
Slipped down behind the sheets, started talkin' bout Pistol Pete  
Slipped down to the African, started talkin' bout what she can do  
Well here we are again, back where we started  
Slipped down to the dark again  
You left your silhouette on my pillow hey  
Well I'm right inside the night, I'm waitin' for the light  
Seems like I'm in the, seems like I'm always in the middle  
They call me free but I call me a fool
