This is someone else's story  
Someone that I never knew  
This is someone else's body  
Am I getting through to you  
If you peel away the armor is something underneath  
If you look below for hidden treasure underneath another layer  
Are you hiding underneath the skin  
CHORUS  
If you peel away the skin is there anybody there  
If you peel away the skin is there anybody there  
If you peel away the armor is it too late to begin  
Is there anybody hiding if you peel away the skin  
Now a spark has passed between us now  
A momentary recognition  
Something lost and something gained  
And something shared that feels strange  
Something cold that will not go away  
There's a heart as cold as ice  
In a vault that's made of stone  
Over years the walls got higher  
Over years the walls have grown  
  
Is there anybody in there in this self inflicted tomb  
If you peel away the layers is there someone in this room  
If you peel away the skin, if you peel away the skin  
This is someone else's story  
Someone that I never knew  
This is someone else's body  
Am I getting through to you
