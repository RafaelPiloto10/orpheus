I shall think it a dream tomorrow  
I won't believe you returned  
That once again I saw and touched you  
And you're so unconserned, unconcerned  
You must have known that your cruel silence  
Would be so hard to bear  
And yet you let me wait, you let me wait and  
Wonder  
Neither here nor there, here nor there  
I came back with just one intention  
For one last look, one last taste of you  
Revenge on those who still despise me  
And take my own life too  
But there's a long and twisted journey  
Between this callous thought and deed  
And you're a sweeter way to give me  
All the things I need  
Two ambitions coincidind  
Will only happen now and then  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore your faith again  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore your faith again  
How I hope it's no dream tomorrow  
But I'm scared the light will fade  
And today will be a vague recollection  
Just a fool's escapade, escapade  
I never cared much about the future  
Yesterday was always there  
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise  
It just isn't fair, isn't fair  
Any plan, any calculation  
Any plot or device at all  
Runs into another's dream  
Runs into a wall  
No matter what premeditation  
In our three score years and ten  
There are only fractured moments  
We'd want to live again  
Two ambitions coinciding  
Will only happen now and then  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore your faith again  
Never hope or dream tomorrow  
Will restore you faith again
