The emotion it was, electric  
And the stars, they all aligned  
I knew I had to make my, decision  
But I never made the time  
No, I never made the time  
  
[Chorus]  
In the dark, for a while now  
I can't stay, so far  
I can't stay, much longer  
Riding my decision home  
  
Exoneration lost his, eraser  
But my forgiver found the sun  
And there are twisted days that I take comfort  
Cause I'm not the only one  
No, I'm not the only one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is a majesty at my doorstep  
There is a little boy in her arms  
Now we'll parade around without game plans  
Obligations, or alarm  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
In the dark
