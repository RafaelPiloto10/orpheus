Country boy, ain't got no shoes  
Country boy, ain't got no blues  
Well, you work all day while you're waiting to play  
In the sun and the sand, with cheeks of tan  
But at the end of the day, when your work is done  
You ain't got nothing but fun  
  
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog  
Country boy, up a hollow log  
Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun  
And with a shell or two, and your dog and you  
When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide  
He's gonna be good fried  
  
Country boy, you got a lot to lose  
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes  
  
Country boy, ain't got no ills  
Country boy, don't owe no bills  
You got a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm  
While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook  
If everything's gonna turn out right, you're gonna fry fish tonight  
  
Country boy, got a lot to lose  
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes  
  
Country boy, you got work to do  
Country boy, in the morning dew  
You gotta plant the seed, you gotta cut the weeds  
There's many a row you know you gotta hoe  
When it's quitting time, and your work is through  
There's a lot if life in you  
  
Country boy, you lucky thing  
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you were me
