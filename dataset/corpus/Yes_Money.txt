Money high, money low  
Money come, money go.  
Don't worry me  
Don't worry me  
  
(Money don't buy)  
  
The things that we like, the things that we love  
The things that we have, so high above  
Don't bother me  
(It doesn't even matter to you)  
Don't bother me  
(money doesn't grow on trees)  
Just don't worry!  
  
Now listen!  
  
Suns do shine, moons do glow  
Simplicity everyone knows  
Don't hurry me  
(I'm in the middle of a dream)  
Don't hurry me  
(It's not at all the way it seems)  
  
Now!  
  
Money so high, money so low  
Money to count, money to go  
It won't be there where I go  
(Where is that you're going to? )  
It won't be there where I go  
(Where is that you're going to? )  
  
Just won't be there  
No way!  
  
[Screw anything you can, and I'm trying  
To do that with the country]  
  
Do wop  
Da da da
