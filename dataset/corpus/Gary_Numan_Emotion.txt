Look up  
Look down  
I've seen it all before  
I need emotion  
Look left  
Look right  
I've tried it all before  
I need emotion  
  
Say nothing  
It's over  
I sold my soul  
Forever  
  
She's tempting  
Sex tension  
It could be the wrong move  
  
One question  
One answer  
I don't need  
Exposure  
  
I don't know  
The slogan  
New fashion kills me  
  
Fashion  
Tear it up  
It don't mean a thing so  
Fashion  
Tear it up good  
  
Touch me  
Picture this  
It don't mean a thing so  
Touch me  
Life is cruel  
  
How did this ever get serious?  
  
One night  
One touch  
I've used them all before  
I need emotion  
  
One lie  
Too much  
I've heard it all before  
I need emotion  
  
I'll show you  
Religion  
Some people  
Disgust me  
  
Listen to  
Opinion  
I'm in a glass house  
  
'I've been sick'  
She whispers  
Abandon  
Nostalgia  
  
Remember  
My picture  
I only work here  
  
I need emotion
