Well I'm a middle-aged teenager  
I'm a man of angst and leisure  
Doin' the best that I can do  
My problems are incorrect  
I've always got it around my neck  
Hey I'm just like you  
Yeah I've done some good and I've done some bad  
But the most fun that I ever had  
Was singing my songs for you  
And if I should go astray  
I'd get down on my knees and pray  
Say God forgive me for what I do  
  
Oh in our lives  
There's no right way for us to live it  
You know in our lives  
There's a time to cry and a time to forget it  
  
Well I'm a broke down humble man  
Baby that's just who I am  
And that's from me to you  
Well I feel good here  
Got about a million more years  
To do what it is I gotta do  
And if some day you happen to be passin' my way  
Say hi, hello, how are you  
Well, I'll return the gesture in kind  
And hope that things are fine  
And you all just do what you gotta do  
  
Oh in our lives  
There's no right way for us to live it  
Oh in our lives  
There's a time to cry and a time to get with it  
You know in our lives there's no right way for us to live it.  
  
Well I'm a broke down humble man  
That's just who I am  
And that's from me to you  
Yeah I'm a broke down humble man  
Yeah that's just who I am  
And that's from me to you  
  
Oh in our lives  
You know in our lives  
Yeah in our lives there's no right way for us to live it
