You need a job, so you can make some money  
You need a nice warm place to stay  
A sense of humor 'cause life ain't funny  
A big stick keeps the wolves away  
You need a car with good tyres on it  
The right place to eat barbecue  
A heavy duty set of jumper cables  
No holes in your walkin' shoes  
The main thing you're gonna find, you need  
A fertile place to plant your seed  
Gotta find somebody to love you  
Someone to be there for you night and day  
Somebody to share with, be a part of you  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
You got to give it away  
I got to recommend some Life Insurance  
Be prepared to dial 911  
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure  
Stay away from the man with the gun  
You need a reason to get up in the mornin'  
Make sure the clock got snooze control  
Be sure you got a place to run for cover  
'Cause overnight things can get real cold  
You're gonna find that sooner or later  
You need a common denominator  
You gotta find somebody to love  
Someone to be there night and day  
Someone to share with, be a part of you  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Oh, give it away  
The main thing you're gonna go, what you need  
A fertile place where the plant you seed  
You got to find somebody to love  
Someone to be there for you night and day  
Someone to share with, be a part of you  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
You gotta find somebody to love  
Be there for you night and day  
Someone to share, be a part of you  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Gotta find somebody, you gotta find somebody  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
You gotta find somebody to love  
Someone to be there for you night and day  
Someone to share with, be a part of you  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Love ain't no good till you give it away  
Gotta give it away, gotta give it away
