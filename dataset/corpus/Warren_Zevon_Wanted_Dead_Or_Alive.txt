I am wanted dead or alive  
I'm wanted everywhere  
I've got to survive  
They say I am a violent man  
Only trying to do the best I can, dig it  
I am wanted dead or alive  
Fifteen states I've got to survive  
I am wanted dead or alive  
I'm a new kind of man  
I've got to survive  
Running a long way  
I am wanted dead or alive  
I'm wanted everywhere  
I've got to survive  
Now all I'm trying to do  
Is find a peaceful place  
But they say I have an outlaw face  
My Lord, I have an outlaw's face  
I have an outlaw's face  
They say I have an outlaw's face  
My, my, yes, I have an outlaw's face  
I have an outlaw's face, I have an outlaw's face  
Oh my Lord, I have an outlaw's face  
Sweet God Almighty, I have an outlaw's face
