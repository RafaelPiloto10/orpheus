I was too busy counting all my zeros  
Never really thought too much about heroes  
Never really thought too much about anyone but me  
Never really opened my eyes wide enough so that I could see  
  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
We're only separated by a few degrees  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
Just like me, just like me  
  
Never really thought too much about tomorrow  
Never really dealt very well with sorrow  
Tired of living my life like a feather floating on the breeze  
Trying to find me a good woman that can bring me down to my knee  
  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
We're only separated by a few degrees  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
Just like me, just like me  
  
I think I've always tried to do the right thing  
I've been a little to scared to ride the lightening  
Tired of living my days surrounded by all these fears  
Still stuck in my ways haven't changed after all these years  
  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
We're only separated by a few degrees  
And I'm just like you, you're just like me  
Just like me, just like me, just like me, just like me  
Just like me, just like me, just like me, just like me
