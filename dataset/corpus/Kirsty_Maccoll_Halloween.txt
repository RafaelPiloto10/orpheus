I must have fallen on my feet  
A hundred times or more  
I heard the wind blow down the street  
The knocking at the door  
But there was no one there  
Though I looked everywhere  
So was it all a dream?  
  
Oh Halloween  
The spirits of the past  
The costumes and the masks  
The shipwrecks and the ghosts  
From up and down the coast  
They've all come back to see  
If we were meant to be  
We can't escape our dreams  
  
Oh Halloween  
You must have followed me back home  
And hid behind my back  
No one could find me on their own  
I'm off the beaten track  
Well I was scared before  
But I'm afraid no more  
And nothing's as it seems  
  
Halloween  
The spirits of the past  
The costumes and the masks  
To me they don't disguise  
The presence in your eyes  
They turn their heads to see  
If we were meant to be  
A nightmare or a dream  
  
Oh Halloween
