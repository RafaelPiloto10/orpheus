[Lil' Bow Wow]  
Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport  
I love the way they dribble up and down the court  
I keep it so fresh on the microphone  
I like no interruption when the game is on  
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop  
My favorite play is the alley-oop  
I like the pick-and-roll  
I like the give-and-go  
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

[Lil' Bow Wow]  
I got the rock in my hands  
Aint no telling what I'm gonna do with it  
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it  
I might cross you up fake one way  
Turn around and hit you with you with the mj fadeaway  
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd  
Taking cats to the rack  
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac  
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style  
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles  
  
[Fabolous]  
Don't too many players get offers like me  
Back and forth, I'll likely  
Shake the checks off your Nikes  
They almost had me in a suit at the draft  
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half  
The first step like Iverson - blow past you  
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too  
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook  
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look  
See my game consist of a whole lotta  
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters  
J. D. Gon lead us to a ring  
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders wanna sing

[Jermaine Dupri]  
Now tell me were you in the joint  
The night mj scored 63 points  
When the Lakers won titles back to back  
Didn't give nobody, no kind of slack  
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim  
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym  
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall  
Playing D with desire, it's basketball
