I will remember you  
Will you remember me?  
Don't let your life pass you by  
Weep not for the memories  
  
I'm so tired  
I can't sleep  
Standing on the edge of something  
Much too deep  
  
It's funny how we feel so much  
And cannot say a word  
We're screaming inside  
But we can't be heard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So afraid to love you  
More afraid to lose  
Clinging to a past  
That doesn't let me choose  
  
Well once there was a darkness  
A deep and endless night  
You gave me everything  
You gave me life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember all the good times that we had  
Let them slip away from us  
When things got bad  
  
How clearly I first saw you  
Smiling in the sun  
I want to feel your warmth around me  
I want to be the one  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
Weep not for the memories  
  
Weep not for the memories
