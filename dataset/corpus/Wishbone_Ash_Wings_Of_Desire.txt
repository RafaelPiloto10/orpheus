I've seen you in black and white  
Like a silent movie,  
But your colours came through tonight  
You really threw me.  
Wings of desire will carry us to where we want to be.  
Wings of desire will keep us flying for eternity.  
I'm riding on a wave of love too blue to lose me.  
I just can't get enough  
You really knew me.  
Wings of desire will carry us to where we want to be.  
Wings of desire will keep us flying for eternity.  
How many times have I told you  
Whenever you ask me why?  
How many times can I hold you?  
You always know when I try.  
We connect without a single word  
Like a book you read me.  
One look, the message heard  
With you it's easy.  
I'm riding on a wave of love  
And I see you in black and white,  
But your colours came through tonight.
