Woke up this morning, not feeling too well  
The man in my mirror looking mighty pale  
On this old CB calling for emergency  
But all of a sudden, it?s dawning on me  
  
I don't need no doctor  
To tell me what's wrong  
I've known my problem  
I've been gone too long, way too long  
  
Homesick fever running through my vein  
Lonely feeling, love hungry pain  
You can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Got this homesick fever mama, missing you  
  
That old evening sun, it's going down on my right  
Baby, I'm southbound coming home tonight  
I'm in the mountain, mama, headed up the hill  
The closer I get to you the better I feel  
  
that's just one gift, mama  
She don't get my mind  
One once of your love honey  
And I?ll be feeling fine, so fine  
  
Homesick fever running through my vein  
Lonely feeling, love hungry pain  
You can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Got this homesick fever mama, missing you  
  
Homesick fever, lonely feelin'  
  
Yes, you can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Homesick fever mama, missing you
