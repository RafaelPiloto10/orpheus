Caught, in an endless time  
Waiting for a sign  
To show you where to go  
Lost, in a silent stare  
Looking anywhere  
For answers you don't know  
  
[Chorus:]  
On the wire  
Balancing your dreams  
Hoping ends will meet their means  
You feel alone  
Uninspired  
Well does it help you to  
Know that I believe in you  
You're an angel waiting for wings...Emily  
  
You, going through this stage  
It's a restless age  
Young and insecure  
Sill, there are doubts to fade  
Moments to be made  
And one of them is yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On the wire  
Balancing your dreams  
Hoping ends will meet their means  
But you feel alone  
Uninspired  
Oh does it help you to  
Know that I believe in you  
You're an angel waiting for wings  
Oh, you're an angel waiting for wings...Emily
