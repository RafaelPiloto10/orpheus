I'm a menace, to society baby  
The police want to relocate me  
They run up with gun up, but they can't faze me  
They wanted to come up, but they ain't crazy got  
I ride one in the chain with gun on top  
Six train Chevrolet rolln' without no top  
Got them hydraulics is dumpin and make it drop  
California to Virginia, Timmy makin it hot  
Takin long rides in a G4 plane  
X-Man to the stage got em goin insane  
Yeah nigga got the world sayin my name  
I'm bout to make a little change, I'm a keep it the same  
X to the Z baby, run up on ya, hittin corners  
Phantom platinum grill  
X be the life of the party,  
Don't be scared girl, reach out and touch somebody  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin' but they won't say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
'Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
  
Hey girl, look where I live  
40 acres and a Maybach Benz  
You wanted to party, but I got biz  
This ain't entertainin, I'm feedin my kids  
On a 4-oh-5 in the car pool lane  
Got to hit some corners, I'm ridin the cane  
Wanna ride out to a island, and tan your frame  
And just waste away a couple of days,  
Holla back at me!  
Look where I rap, make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat  
LA on my baseball hat, where they wanna ride up on you in that black on black  
Move, betta, bounce like a mother  
When brother got mass weapons of war with each other  
X getting big, not ready to die yet, my militant mindset  
Got you runnin for cover  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin' but they won't say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
'Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
  
I'm the life of the party,  
I got a moon roof, we poppin up out of  
Look at the whole world they talkin about us  
I got a mean hook, to rattle ya body  
  
I wanna talk a little, pick ya brain  
Wanna see you in somethin little, walk around the plane  
I got a lot to gain, getting my record off the ground  
Like David Blaine  
So now, what you know bout me?, I'm a self-made man from poverty  
Now I own a lot of property  
I pimp rides, lifestyles, and companies  
Now let me spit you the facts  
I used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringin you that  
I'm like swingin a bat, run at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that  
Baby girl touchin my chain, now let me tell you who I ain't  
Bitch you can't run no games, (A gangsta baby, ain't nothing changed)  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin' but they won't say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
'Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy, huh?  
Hey Now, Hey Now
