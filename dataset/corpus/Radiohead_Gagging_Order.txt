I know what you're thinking  
But I'm not your property  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you say  
  
Move along, there's nothing left to see  
Just a body, nothing left to see  
  
A couple more for breakfast  
A little more for tea  
Just to take the edge off  
Just to take the edge off  
  
Move along, there's nothing left to see  
Just a body, pouring down the street  
  
Move along, there's nothing left to see  
Just a body, nothing left to see  
  
Move along
