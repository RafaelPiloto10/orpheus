The first time I looked in your eyes I knew  
That I would do anything for you  
The first time you touched my face I felt  
What I'd never felt with anyone else  
  
I want to give back, what you've given to me  
And I want to witness all of your dreams  
Now that you've shown me who I really am  
I want to be more than just your man  
  
I want to be the wind that fills your sails  
And be the hand that lifts your veil  
And be the moon that moves your tide  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that you've been dreaming of and more, so much more  
I want to be your everything  
  
When you wake up I'll be the first thing you see  
And when it gets dark you can reach out to me  
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts  
I'll be your compass baby when you get lost  
  
I want to be the wind that fills your sails  
Be the hand that lifts your veil  
Be the moon that moves your tide  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that you've been dreaming of and more, so much more  
I want to be your everything  
  
I'll be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that you've been dreaming of and more, so much more  
I want to be your everything  
I want to be your everything  
I want to be your everything, I want to be your everything
