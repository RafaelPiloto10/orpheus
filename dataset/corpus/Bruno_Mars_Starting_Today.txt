We had a date, I stood you up  
You tried to call but I didn't pick up  
See I forgot about our plans..  
Please forgive your man for ruining your night so many times  
I'm sorry, I know you're mad  
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had  
So I'm stopping all these childish things, girl, you mean too much to me  
Your love is worth too much to lose  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
Girl, I'm starting today..  
You're tired of playing the kiss and make up game  
And I apologize for the man I became  
If I could do it all again, I wouldn't hurt my best friend  
And I'd throw away all my selfish ways I'm sorry, I know you're mad  
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had  
So I'm stopping all these childish things, girl, you mean too much to me  
Your love is worth too much to lose  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
Girl, I'm starting today..  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today
