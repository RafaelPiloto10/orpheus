Do me wrong, do me right  
Tell me lies, but hold me tight  
Save your good-byes for the morning light  
But don't let me be lonely tonight  
  
Say good-bye and say hello  
Sure 'nough good to see you  
But it's time to go  
Don't say yes, but please  
Don't say no  
I don't want to be lonely tonight  
  
Go away then, damn you  
Go on and do as you please  
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees  
I'm undecided and your heart's been divided  
You've been turning my world upside down  
  
Do me wrong, do me right  
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight  
Save your good-byes for the morning light  
But don't let me be lonely tonight
