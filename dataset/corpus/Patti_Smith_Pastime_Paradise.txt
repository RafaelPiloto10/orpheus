Been spending most their lives  
Living in a pastime paradise  
Been spending most their lives  
Living in a pastime paradise  
Been wasting most their lives  
Glorifying days long gone behind  
Been wasting most their days  
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise  
Who of them will come to be  
How many of them are you and me?  
Dissipation, race relations  
Consolation, segregation  
Dispensation, isolation, exploitation, mutilation  
Mutations, miscreation, confirmation to the evils of the world  
Been spending most their lives  
Living in a future paradise  
Been spending most their lives  
Living in a future paradise  
Been looking in their minds  
For the day that sorrow's gone from time  
Keep telling of the day  
When the savior of love will come to stay  
Who of them will come to be  
How many of them are you and me?  
Proclamation of race relations  
Immigration, integration  
Verification of relations, acclamation, world salvation  
Vibrations, stimulation, confirmation to the peace of the world
