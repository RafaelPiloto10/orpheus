Long, long ago  
In a world dark and cold  
Night so still, winter's chill  
One bright star was shining  
On a bed made of hay  
In a manger He lay  
The shepherds came, they knew His name  
King of Kings, a brand new day  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on us in tenderness  
It brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night  
On this Christmas day  
May that star light your way  
This Christmas Eve, I still believe  
That same star still shines on me  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on us in tenderness  
It brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night  
May it shine it's light on you this Christmas Night
