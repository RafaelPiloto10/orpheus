Say that you'll marry me  
Sometimes carry me  
And I will be there forever more  
For you  
  
And if you marry me  
I will give everything  
And I will do anything that you need  
We do  
  
You'll know, by the love in my eyes  
And the beat of my heart  
I'll be there  
  
You'll know, cause you'll never be lonely again  
Anytime anywhere  
This I promise  
If you Marry me  
  
Promise you'll stay with me  
We'll make some memories  
And maybe a dream or two  
Will come true, who knows  
  
This I can say for sure  
All that I have is yours  
You'll never wonder where I stand  
It shows  
  
You'll know, by the love in my eyes  
And the beat of my heart  
I'll be there  
  
You'll know, cause you'll never be lonely again  
Anytime anywhere  
All I promise you I will be  
If you'll only say you'll Marry me  
  
I won't ever forget these words  
And I'll love you for all I'm worth  
If you say you will Marry me  
Won't you Marry me  
  
Marry me
