I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Something that you said burnin' in my head  
I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Everything you do makes me furious with you  
  
It's like a poison to me  
It's like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
I'm so angry  
I'm so stupid  
Everything you say, I believe it anyway  
I'm so stupid  
I'm so angry  
Running after you, that's what I gotta do  
  
It's like a poison to me  
It's like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Is there any one at all  
Any one you didn't call  
Is there any one you didn't deny  
Is there any one you missed  
Any one you didn't kiss  
Is there any law you didn't defy  
  
I'm so crazy  
I'm so crazy  
I used to be so cool, now I'm just your little fool  
I'm so crazy  
I'm so crazy  
Talking in my sleep like a scary little creep  
  
It's like a poison to me  
It's like you put me in shock  
You stick a needle in me  
Every time that you talk  
  
Is there any one at all  
Anyone you didn't call  
Is there any one you didn't deny  
Is there any one you missed  
Anyone you didn't kiss  
Is there any law you didn't defy  
  
I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Always chewing nails, it never, ever fails  
I'm so angry  
I'm so angry  
Better hide my knife, better run for your life  
  
So Angry  
So Angry  
I'm so angry  
Angry, angry, angry etc.
