I know you know my boyfriend is out of town  
So have a drink, let's talk it over  
So many things I shouldn't be sayin' now  
You know I like my boys a little bit older  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight. tonight, tonight  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
  
All my girls are nowhere to be found  
They all split when I'm in trouble  
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around  
The 'undercover-lovers' under the covers  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight. tonight, tonight  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
  
I just wanna use your l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e  
I just wanna use your l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e  
I just wanna use your l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e  
  
try to keep my head from spinning  
Too much to drink, not making sense  
Been a while since I've been with someone new  
But I can't stop the way I'm feeling  
  
As you leave please would you just close the door  
Now that our love affair is over  
You're exactly what I was looking for  
We'll go find a shoulder to cry upon  
  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
  
(You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all  
  
I think I'm done fuck'n singing this song  
I think I'm done fuck'n singing this song  
I think I'm done fuck'n singing this song  
Singing this song, song, song song
