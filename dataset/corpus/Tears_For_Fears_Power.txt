Last years rivals share their blood  
Sailor sworn to secrecy  
Ride the waves and stem the flood  
The tides of endless enmity  
Power now is all the rage  
Sons and daughters of the gun  
Hungry babies come of age  
Phasers switched and set to stun  
Power now, power how, power wow!  
Here's power  
If you're seeking power . . .  
Doctor held you tight and torn  
Boy he was a lucky man  
Out of you the future born  
Slight of foot and sight of hand  
Douse the candle, dim the light  
Focus not on fire or flame  
Don't believe that might is right  
Your soul can turn you just the same  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power  
If you take my breath away  
The whole damn thing will turn and return  
Redefined, rearranged, rearranged  
And till my dying the day  
I guess I'll have to burn just to learn  
This the time, this the place  
To show a human face  
Dressed to kill we guessed you might  
Friend or foe or family  
We'll sacrifice the Virgin white  
Her death will be the life of me  
Power now is all the rage  
Don't excuse it use it well  
Keep the lion in his cage  
Free from hunger, free from hell  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power!
