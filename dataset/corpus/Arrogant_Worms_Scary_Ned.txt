Let me tell you a story about scary Ned  
Scariest guy to ever wet a bed  
He had hands on his arms and eyes on his head  
But they weren't his  
  
He'd go down to the market and try to scare the fish  
He said that they bothered him, they weren't his favorite dish  
Then he'd go down to the highway and pretend that he was dead  
That just the way he was, creepy scary Ned  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
  
Ned loved Halloween 'cause he didn't need a mask  
He'd steal the children's candy, he didn't even ask  
He'd sit right down in front of them and then he'd start to eat  
He'd tell them they were better off 'cause that stuff can rot your teeth  
  
Oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
A strange glow would come from his place late into the night  
He'd watch T.V. 'til the dawn, you know that ain't right  
If he started to get tired he'd rub sauerkraut on his head  
That's just the kind of guy he was, good old scary Ned  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
He had a face his mother didn't love  
When people saw on the street they often said "Uughh!"  
Sometimes late at night he'd walk alone  
He'd be reciting stuff  
Bad sounding stuff  
Icky awful stuff  
But when you got to know him, he weren't so bad  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Scary Ned  
  
Oh oh Scary Ned  
He's pretty scary  
Scary Ned  
Really scary  
Scary Ned  
He's scary  
Hence the name  
Scary Ned  
I saw him yesterday  
He said "Hi"  
I got scared  
'Cause he's  
Scary Ned  
If he weren't scary  
I supposed he'd be called  
Like, Happy Ned  
And who wants to hear a song about  
Happy Ned (Happy Ned)
