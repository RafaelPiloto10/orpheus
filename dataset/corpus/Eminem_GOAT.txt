Here it go  
See this is the part I was worried about  
Everybody thinks that my career was down the tubes  
And I must be in some dusty garage  
Inhalin' the carbon monoxide fumes  
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do and how I should come out or what
to rap about  
And I know that I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out  
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off  
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky  
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me: worship:  
See the thing about me, is you don't really know a thing about me  
Everyone's makin' a stink about me  
Like it's some kind of a aura of that up that came around me  
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers and bangers
