There's just no way to say how much I love you  
You never make me cry and that's just fine  
I've only got my fear to burn above me  
You know we all get scared from time to time  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
There's just no way to play the things I'm feelin'  
No way to tell you all the things you mean  
Every day I only feel like stealin'  
Away to where I know I can be free  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me when I'm wild  
  
Laying down the ways to say I need you  
Scared of lookin' tall and feeling small  
Running through the days I have beside you  
Scared of being wrong, and that's it all  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child
