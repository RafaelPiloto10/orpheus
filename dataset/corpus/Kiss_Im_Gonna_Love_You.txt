Don't let me find you  
Sleepin' with another man  
Say you're gonna be true  
And stay and love me like you can  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
Honey, won't you tell me  
You don't want nobody else  
Don't you tear my heart out  
And lay it on your shelf  
  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
And I'm gonna love you (gonna love you)  
Rain or come shine (rain or come shine)  
You know you're gonna find me (gonna find me)  
Around you all the time (time)  
  
'Cause I really love you and it's true  
I'm gonna love you rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine, rain or come shine
