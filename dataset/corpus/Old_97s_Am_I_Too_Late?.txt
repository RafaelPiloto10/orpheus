When you were just a little girl in Pine Bluff,  
Daddy disappeared without a trace.  
Now there's no more little girls in Pine Bluff,  
They all ran like tears out of this place.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Am I too late  
Am I too late  
Tell you that I love you  
Now they've carried you away  
  
(repeat)  
  
Never thought that you would see a sickbed,  
Never thought that you'd stop bein' 'round.  
Now I hear you're lost and gone forever,  
Just like all the other girls in town.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now I hear that you have gone to Heaven,  
And if there's one, I'm sure that's where you are.  
Maybe you're the new star in the night sky,  
Just outside the moonroof on my car.  
  
(2x Chorus)  
  
Tell you that I love you  
Now they've carried you away  
Tell you that I love you  
Now they've carried you away  
Tell you that I love you  
Now they've carried you away
