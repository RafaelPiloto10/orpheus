I feel so bad I've got a worried mind  
I'm so lonesome all the time  
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou  
  
Savin' nickels, savin' dimes  
Workin' till the sun don't shine  
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou  
  
I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou  
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou  
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see  
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be  
  
Oh, to see my baby again  
And to be with some of my friends  
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou  
  
I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou  
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou  
Ah, that girl of mine by my side  
The silver moon and the evening tide  
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside  
  
I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on Blue Bayou
