You're sweeter than the morning  
When the sun is shining down on me  
There is nothing you can say  
That could make me go away you see  
But you keep saying to me baby  
  
Hold on,  
I feel I'm getting ready  
Hold on,  
I feel I'm rockin' steady  
Hold on,  
I'm gonna make it with you woman  
Hold on,  
You got to gimme some love, gimme some love  
  
I held back before  
But your love took me easily  
You got the power  
I knew was gonna creep up on me  
The more I give  
Your love keeps comin' on strong  
Although it's mine now  
I know it won't be for long  
There's something in the saying  
That a woman needs a little more time  
I'm getting tired of waiting for you  
Giving me some kind of sign  
  
Hold on  
I've got to love you when I want to  
Hold on  
You've got to love me when I want you to  
Hold on  
I ain't gonna let you leave me baby  
Hold on  
No never no more  
  
I know the game you're playing  
And I guess you think I'm easily led  
You think the words you're saying  
Are really going through my head  
I'm gonna take you home  
And give you all I can  
I'll prove to you, baby  
That really I'm a man  
  
Hold on  
I know I'm feeling ready  
Hold on  
I know I'm rockin' steady  
Hold on  
Guess I've made it with you woman  
Hold on  
I've got you giving me love  
  
Something that you give me  
Keeps me hangin' on  
No use me stayin'  
There's nothing to be done  
I'm gonna take you home  
And give you all I can  
I'll prove to you woman  
That really I'm a man  
  
Hold on  
I only want to take you higher  
Hold on  
You are the root of my desire  
Hold on  
c'mon baby light my fire  
Hold on
