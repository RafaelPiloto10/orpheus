They're writing songs of love but not for me  
A lucky star's above but not for me  
With love to lead the way  
I've found more clouds of gray  
Than any Russian play can guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall and get this way  
Ah ho alas and awe so lackaday  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess she's not she's not for me  
  
Old man sunshine listen you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it and all start a riot  
  
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare  
Ever tell me she will care  
I'm certain it's the final curtain  
  
I never want to here from any cheerful Polly-Anna's  
Who tell you fate supplies a mate it's all bananas  
  
It all began so well but what an end  
This is the time a fellow needs a friend  
When every happy plot  
Ends with a marriage knot  
And there's no knot, no (k)not for me
