Lay at my side and shut out the world  
Warm this cold heart and wrap me in love  
Pour magic into a space made for you  
Lifetimes of longing are to live through  
Blue blue blue blue blue blue  
All of my life I've hungered for you  
All my lost days of dreaming are through  
Riding the clouds on a mission of schemes  
Now you are here oh how simple it seems  
Blue blue blue blue blue blue  
Blue is my world cold is my name  
Love was my problem with no one to blame and you  
Taught me how to see light shine in me  
Light is reflected so easily  
I said blue no more blue don't say good-bye  
You leave me breathless with nothing to say  
Turned me burned me and blew me away  
And if you leave like a ghost without trace  
This night of love means a world I can face  
Blue blue blue blue blue blue  
Holding you close timeless together  
Heaven just spoke freeze this moment forever and  
All other images fall from my eyes  
Love you have come to me straight from the skies  
I said blue no more blue  
I said blue no more blue don't say good-bye  
I will always know that love can live
