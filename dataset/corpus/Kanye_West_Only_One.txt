[Intro]  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say  
  
[Hook 1]  
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun  
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say  
  
[Hook 2]  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand  
  
[Bridge]  
So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly  
  
[Hook 3]  
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun  
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name  
And you're still my chosen one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Outro]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab (I just want you to do me a favor)  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me
