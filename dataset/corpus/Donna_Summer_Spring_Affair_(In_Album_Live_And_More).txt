Spoken:  
Thank you!  
Good Evening!  
Why don't you follow me on my magical mystical journey  
Through time and love  
This is what you've been waiting for  
Come on now  
  
Ooh, something's coming over me  
Ooh, I think it's got a hold on me, it's got me  
  
Ooh, just the man I hoped you'd be  
Ooh, just the man to set me free,  
You got me, you got all of me  
  
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair  
And I'm hung on you, oh yeah  
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair  
And we've got something new  
  
Ooh, you're the sunshine in my life  
Ooh, how you come on shining bright, you got me  
  
Ooh, the feeling's getting really strong  
Ooh, gives me strength to carry on  
You got me, you got all of me  
  
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair  
And I'm hung on you  
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair  
And we've got something new  
  
It's a spring affair  
It's a spring affair  
It's a spring affair  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
