Cold sweat, cold sweat  
Cold..  
Go away, go away, go!  
I'm sweating baby  
In my bed of roses  
Sweating baby  
In my bed of roses  
Love, I don't want it  
....  
Answer the fucking phone!  
Cold sweat, cold sweat  
Go away, go away, go!  
I'm sweating baby  
In my bed of roses  
Sweating baby  
In my bed of roses  
Love, I don't want it  
Put your cold hand in my pocket  
.....  
Answer the fucking phone!  
Go away, go away, go!  
I'm sweating baby  
In my bed of roses  
Sweating baby  
Lying in my heaven of roses  
Drunk, on a trip, and i'll take him  
....  
Ooh, oooh  
Cold sweat  
Go away, go away, go!...
