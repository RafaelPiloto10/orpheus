Oh twinkling we  
Can't see the right roads when the streets are big  
That old slave mill might grind slow  
  
But it grinds fine  
African Herbsman why linger on  
Just concentrate 'cause heaven lives on  
Retire slave men will look with a scorn  
With a transplanted heart  
That's how quick they have to part  
That's how quick  
  
The remembrance of today  
Sad feeling of tomorrow oh yeah  
African herbsman seize your time  
Taking illusion to the edge of my mind  
Taking loses down through my life  
Down through my life yes  
That's how quick  
That's how quick  
  
Do they part yes they part  
In remembrance of today oh yeah  
African Herbsman why linger on  
Just concentrate 'cause heaven lives on  
Retired slave men will look with a scorn  
With a transplanted heart 'cause that's how quick  
That's how quick  
  
The remembrance of today sad feeling of tomorrow  
Lead me oh Lord, Lord, Lord I pray  
African Herbsman (repeat 5 times)  
Oh twinkling we  
Can't see the road when the streets are big  
That old slave mill might grind slow  
But it grinds fine  
  
African Herbsman seize your time  
Taking illusion on the edge of my mind  
Taking loses down through their lives  
Down throught heir lives  
The African Herbsman [Repeat: x3]
