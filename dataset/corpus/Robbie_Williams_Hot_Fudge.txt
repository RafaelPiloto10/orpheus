Yeah!  
  
Queen Bitch, eat the rich  
I'm on the second course today.  
I'm not the first  
And I won't be the worst  
You done most of LA.  
Can't find a virgin  
I can get you a surgeon  
24 hours a day.  
Wasn't Jean Genie a Rolling Stones hit?  
I'm about to be blown away.  
  
Come on, sing it  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo.  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
There's a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
And we've been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother, things have got to change  
I'm moving to LA.  
  
Take the piss  
I was English  
God bless you Uncle Sam.  
You got a cool gene pool  
And I went to school  
And God knows I love to tan.  
Making cents and dead presidents  
Before I could count to ten.  
With the nation behind me  
Can't stop the limey  
She's on her back again.  
  
Come on, sing it  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo.  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
There's a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
'Cause we've been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother, things have got to change  
I'm moving to LA, LA, LA  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo.  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
There's a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
'Cause we've been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother, things have got to change  
I'm moving to  
  
Keep a-moving keep a-moving, keep a-moving to LA  
Mo, mo, mo, mo
