When I hear the music... Lord, I'm gonna let it play... Somethin' like that!  
  
Did you ever get up on the wrong side of the bed  
With an achin' head, and just fall apart  
You're runnin' late, the boss is bitchin'  
It's cold outside and your car won't start  
Well I don't mean to bitch, I swear  
'Cause we all got our cross to bear  
  
Chorus:  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Gotta let it play  
Sure as darkness, I can see the day  
But when I hear the music  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Let it play  
  
Life's just rented space, Gettin' laid to waste  
When the lines on my face say I'm growing older  
Just a stitch in time, Gonna save my mind  
When the weight of the world lies on my shoulers  
Soon I won't have a place to fit  
But I'll cross that bridge when I come to it  
  
Chorus:  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Gotta let it play  
Sure as darkness, I can see the day  
But when I hear the music  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Let it play  
  
Solo  
  
Chorus:  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Gotta let it play  
Sure as darkness, I can see the day  
But when I hear the music  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Let it play  
  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Gotta let it play  
Sure as darkness, I can see the day  
But when I hear the music  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Let it play  
  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Gotta let it play  
Sure as darkness, I can see the day  
But when I hear the music  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, Let it play
