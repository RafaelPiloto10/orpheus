We know better it was bitter, baby  
Watching love become a lie  
Now we're coming to that point of no returning  
Do you really want to try ?  
Are the reasons or the chances any better than before ?  
Are we into something more than we imagined  
That we really can't afford ?  
Does it matter anymore ?  
You're the biggest gamble that I've ever tried to win  
Maybe more than I can stand to lose  
But girl I never thought I'd ever feel this good again  
More than I could dream of coming true  
I'll take any chance I can with you.
