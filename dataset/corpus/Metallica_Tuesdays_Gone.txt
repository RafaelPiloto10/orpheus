Hey, you guys ready?  
One, two, three, one, two, three  
  
Train roll on, on down the line,  
Won't you please take me far, far away.  
Now I feel the wind blow, outside my door,  
I'm leavin' my woman at home, oh yeah.  
My baby's gone  
Tuesday's gone with the wind,  
My baby's gone, gone with that wind  
Long Gone (Gary)  
  
(Pepper)  
And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'.  
I just want to be left alone.  
When this train ends, I'll try again.  
I'm leavin' my woman at home.  
My baby's gone  
  
Tuesday's gone with the wind. (oh yeah)  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
My baby's gone, with the wind.  
Train roll on (Jean paul)  
  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
My baby's gone, with the wind.  
  
Train roll on  
Train roll on many miles from my home,  
See I'm, I'm ridin' my blues, babe, blues away, yeah.  
But Tuesday you see, oh, she had to be free.  
Somehow I got to, to carry on.  
My baby's gone.  
  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind. (Tuesday's gone)  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
My baby's gone, with the wind.  
  
Train roll on, train roll on  
Ride on train, ride on train, ride on train  
Train roll on, (train rolls on)  
The train, it rolls on  
  
Train rolls on (train rolls on)  
Lord, I can't change (I can't change)  
Lord, I can't change (I can't change)  
Lord, I can't change  
Lord, I can't change (I can't change)  
Train roll on  
Ride on train
