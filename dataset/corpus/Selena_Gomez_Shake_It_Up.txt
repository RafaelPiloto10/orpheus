Don't like waiting  
Don't like waiting  
Lets go right now!  
Gotta' hit the ground  
Dancing before the music  
Slows down  
  
What I'm sayin'  
What I'm sayin'  
If there's something to fix  
Take it to another level,  
This is the remix  
  
Everybody, everybody  
Get out on the floor  
It can get a little crazy  
When the kick hits the floor  
  
Make a scene  
Make a scene  
Nobody can ignore  
Don't knock it, til you rock it  
We can't take it no more  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off,  
Shake it up!  
Shake it up!  
DJ set it off!  
Take it up a notch  
All together now!  
Shake it up!  
Shake it up!  
  
Shake it up!  
Break it down  
Break it down  
I've got something to say  
When you're dancin' with me,  
It's like we go MIA  
  
Make a scene  
Make a scene  
Nobody can ignore  
Don't knock it, til you rock it  
We can't take it no more  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off,  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
  
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up,  
You gotta change it up  
And if the days not right?  
Just brush it off tonight  
Put on the attitude  
Your in my pocket mood  
And when you've had enough,  
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off,  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
  
Bring the lights up  
Bust the doors down  
Dust yourself off,  
Shake it up  
Shake it up  
DJ set it off  
Take it up a notch  
All together now  
Shake it up  
Shake it up
