Interrupting all programs  
  
This is radio clash from pirate satellite  
  
Orbiting your living room,  
Cashing in the bill of rights  
Cuban army surplus or refusing all third lights  
This is radio clash on pirate satellite  
  
This sound does not subscribe  
To the international plan  
In the psycho shadow of the white right hand  
Then that see ghettology as an urban Vietnam  
Giving deadly exhibitions of murder by napalm  
  
This is radio clash tearing up the seven veils  
This is radio clash please save us, not the whales  
This is radio clash underneath a mushroom cloud  
This is radio clash  
You don't need that funeral shroud  
  
Forces have been looting  
My humanity  
Curfews have been curbing  
The end of liberty  
  
Hands of law have sorted through  
My identity  
But now this sound is brave  
And wants to be free - anyway to be free  
  
This is Radio clash on pirate satellite  
This is not free Europe  
Not an armed force network  
This is Radio Clash using audio ammunition  
This is Radio Clash can we get that world to listen?  
This is Radio Clash using aural ammunition  
This is Radio Clash can we get that world to listen?  
This is Radio Clash on pirate satellite  
Orbiting your living room,  
Cashing in the bill of rights  
This is radio Clash on pirate satellite  
This is radio Clash everybody hold on tight  
  
A-riggy diggy dig dang dang  
  
Go back to urban 'nam
