Our hand is like a torch each time you touch me  
That look that's in your eyes pulls me apart  
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in  
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.  
  
Your kiss is like a drink, oh, when I'm thirsty  
Oh, and I'm thirsty for you with all my heart  
But don't love me then act as though we've never kissed  
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.  
  
Don't give me something, oh, that you might take away  
To have you then lose you it wouldn't be smart on my part  
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in  
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.  
  
No, don't give me something, Lord, that you might take away  
To have you then lose you it wouldn't be smart on my part  
Don't open the door to heaven, honey, if I can't come in  
And don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart.  
  
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart
