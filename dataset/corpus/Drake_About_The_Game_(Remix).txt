[Drake:]  
It's Southern Smoke Boy!  
Ho, Yeah, Uh huh  
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-are-A-K-K-E  
Ahahaha, the boy of summer are here man  
Ayo Track, I got something mean for this one boy  
  
[Verse 1: drake]  
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around  
I made money that's why these girls eyeing me down  
By nineteen I might seem desitend for millions  
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled  
In I take q's from my big boy popz  
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch  
They getting foul on the star  
But it's all eyes on me like I'm coppin some vows for the bar  
Get it guess not picture me not strive  
To land in the top ten slip in the top five  
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy  
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me  
Now a day I peep they intrests  
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed  
Money making brothers should take notes  
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat  
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a  
This knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later  
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up  
I put a split in the middle then I seperater  
  
[Chorus: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ridin' low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
That's just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
That's it goes  
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough  
Cause it ain't all about that no more  
  
[Chorus: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game  
  
[Verse 3: trey songz]  
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be  
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free  
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury  
But without it all I'm still about the game  
  
[Bridge:]  
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)  
  
[Chorus x2: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game  
  
[Verse 4:]  
Ridin' low  
Layed back in the seat when I creep  
That's just how I roll  
With some fresh nice ones on my feet  
That's it goes  
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough  
Cause it ain't all about that no more  
  
[Bridge:]  
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing  
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)  
  
[Chorus x2: trey songz]  
It aint about the rims on my truck  
Aint about the ice on my watch  
Aint about teh coop of my truck  
Baby it's about the Game  
  
It aint about the shoes that I've got  
Aint about my dough or my rocks  
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop  
Baby it's about the game
