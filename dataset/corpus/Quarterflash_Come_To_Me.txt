There's a lizard on my window,  
There's a moon above Cassis  
There's a menu in my room that can't be read  
I am burned, broke and legless on pastis  
And tonight you're all I really miss or need  
There's a band down the street  
Singing high and sweet  
But I can't make out a word they say  
"Tout le monde de besoin d'amour"  
  
Won't you come to me, come to me  
Won't you come to me  
  
There's a map inside my pocket,  
But I don't know where I'll go  
I'm pulled in all directions by the moon  
I am lost, free, exhausted and alive  
And you been on my mind all afternoon  
But the lines are always blocked  
And the operators talk  
But I can't make out a word they say  
"Tout le monde de besoin d'amour"  
  
Won't you come to me, come to me  
Won't you come to me
