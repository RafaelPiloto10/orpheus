My life changes all the time.  
Things were different when you were mine.  
You loved me yesterday.  
Now these changes have come to stay.  
There have been changes,  
So many changes along the way.  
(Too many changes,changes in the way).  
(So many changes,changes in the how).  
(To many changes, changes when you cry).  
  
Time brings changes,right or wrong.  
I still love you, but now you're gone.  
  
Maybe someday love will come,  
But who can say what kind of changes,  
What kind of changes come my way.  
(Too many changes come along).  
(Too many changes,leaving me alone).  
(So many changes,now that you are gone).
