Let's try getting to the sky  
Hang on or you're going to die  
Sour life can turn sweet  
It's laying at your feet  
Sweet child with an innocent smile  
Watched closely all the while  
Don't be fooled when he cries  
Keep looking at the eyes  
  
Good life is contradiction  
Because of the crucifixion  
If you're ready and have the need  
I will take your soul and plant my seed  
  
You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day  
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away  
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel  
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal  
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs  
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers  
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise  
And icy fingers fan electric lies  
  
We're disturbing the priest  
Won't you please come to our feast  
Do we mind disturbing the priest  
Not at all not at all not in the least  
  
The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face  
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace  
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light  
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside  
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away  
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and the night and day  
The force of the devil that we're all told to fear  
Watched out for religion when he gets too near too near
