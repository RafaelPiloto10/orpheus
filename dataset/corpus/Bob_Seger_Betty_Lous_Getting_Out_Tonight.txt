Words and music by bob seger  
  
Have you heard the news  
It's all over town  
If you ain't heard it boys  
You better sit down  
  
I got the story here  
It's hot off the press  
Brace yourself now  
And take a deep breath  
Grob a hold of something  
Hold on tight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
  
First heard the rumor down on 12th and main  
  
The poor druggist he was going insane  
His stuff is selling out like never before  
He finally had to up and close the store  
  
All the boys were getting ready to fight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
Betty lou's gettin' out tonight  
She was bad  
Her momma got mad  
But now her momma said it's all right  
All the boys are getting ready and right  
Betty lou's gettin'out tonight  
  
Betty lou  
Betty lou  
It's all true  
It's really true  
What do you think about that boys
