I'm sitting on top of the world  
Just rollin' along, just rollin' along  
  
And I'm quittin' the blues of the world  
Just singin' a song, just singin' a song  
  
Glory, Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson  
"Hey, Par, get ready to call"  
Just like humpty dumpty  
I'm goin' to fall  
  
And I'm sitting on top of the world  
Just rollin' along, oh, rollin' along  
  
Glory, Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson  
"Hey, Par, get ready to call"  
Just like humpty dumpty  
I'm goin' to fall  
  
And I'm sitting on top, top of the world  
Just rollin' along, just rollin' along  
  
Glory, Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson  
"Hey, Par, get ready to call"  
Just like humpty dumpty  
I'm goin' to fall  
  
And I'm sitting on top, top of the world  
Just rollin' along, just rollin' along
