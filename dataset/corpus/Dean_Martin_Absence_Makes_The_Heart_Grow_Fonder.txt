If you should leave me,  
I know it would grieve me,  
So honey please remember,  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder...  
  
For somebody else  
I love you dearly,  
I'm yours sincerely,  
But honey please remember,  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder...  
For somebody else  
When the cat's away the mice will play,  
I don't say I will but still I may,  
  
I may be blue away from you,  
And then again I may be gay.  
When I get fretful, I get forgetful,  
So honey please remember,  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder,  
For somebody else.  
When the cat's away the mice will play,  
I don't say I will but still I may,  
  
I may be blue away from you,  
And then again I may be gay.  
When I get fretful I get forgetful,  
So honey please remember,  
  
Absence makes the heart grow fonder,  
For somebody else...  
For somebody else...
