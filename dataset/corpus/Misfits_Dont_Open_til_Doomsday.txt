Buried beneath the statue, the answer hides  
Enduring throughout the ages  
The transmitter lies  
Once the chambers open the signal will be sent  
To another world... far beyond the stars  
  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
Destruction's not far away  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
You might not like what you find  
  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
Destruction's not far away  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
You might not like what you find inside  
  
We were warned of this coming so long ago  
Immortal secrets... man shouldn't know  
Entering a realm where we just don't belong  
We called them and they're coming  
  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
Destruction's not far away  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
You might not like what you find inside  
  
Don't open 'til doomsday  
(Inside) Destruction's not far away  
(Inside) Don't open 'til doomsday  
You might not like what you find  
You might not like what you find inside
