Lonely nights I think of you  
My life, my king and my land  
Land of war will turn into light  
Divine light will give us strength  
  
Sunlight divine cover my land  
Angels of light take care of us  
  
Still darkness surrounds myself  
Among the trees I saw the gates of hell  
I hear that someone screams my name  
Devil claims for my life  
  
Sunlight divine give me the strength  
Angels of light show me the way  
  
Flying up in the sky, riding through the wind  
Until dawn things won't change at all  
Strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart  
Angels of light help me save my land  
  
Stars guide me in this night  
Light my way to fight the dark  
God, I pray to you one more time  
With your help I'll save my land  
  
Sunlight divine cover my land  
Angels of light take care of us  
  
Flying up in the sky, riding through the wind  
Until dawn things won't change at all  
Strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart  
Angels of light help me save my land
