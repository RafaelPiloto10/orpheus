I looked over at my pillow but your face wasn't there  
And I don't smell the perfume you used to wear  
And I don't see your blouse or jeans or your pretty white cotton gown  
And I've looked all over Hell but Heaven can't be found  
  
I looked on the bedside table but your jewelry was all gone  
And I just wish you'd call every time I look at the phone  
I looked in our dressing mirror and I saw myself break down  
Oh, I looked all over Hell but Heaven can't be found  
  
I called and looked in everyplace you used to hang around  
I've searched in every bar and club and honkey tonk in town  
And I don't know if I can go on without breaking down  
I've looked all over Hell but Heaven can't be found  
  
And I don't know if I can go on without breaking down  
Oh, I've looked all over Hell but my Heaven can't be found
