I got chills  
They're multiplying  
And I'm losing control  
Cause the power you're supplying  
  
It's electrifying!  
You better shape up  
Cause I need a man  
And my heart is set on you  
  
You better shape up  
You better understand  
To my heart I must be true  
Nothing left  
  
Nothing left for me to do  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
The one that I want  
  
Oo-oo-oo  
The one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need  
Oh, yes indeed  
  
If you're filled  
With affection  
You're too shy to convey  
Better take my direction  
  
Feel your way  
Feel your way  
You better shape up  
'Cause I need a man  
  
Who can keep me satisfied  
You better shape up  
If you're gonna prove  
That my faith is justified  
  
Are you sure  
Yes I'm sure down deep inside  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need  
  
Oh, yes indeed  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo  
You're the one that I want  
  
Oo-oo-oo  
You're the one that I want  
Oo-oo-oo, the one I need  
Oh, yes indeed  
  
You're the one that I want  
You're the one that I want  
The one I need  
Oh, yes indeed
