If I'm butter, if I'm butter  
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife  
He makes my heart a cinema scope  
He's showing the dancing bird of paradise  
  
If I'm butter, if I'm butter  
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife  
He makes my heart a cinema scope  
He's showing the dancing bird of paradise  
  
He excites me  
Must be like a genesis of rhythm  
I get feisty  
Whenever I'm with him  
  
If I'm butter, if I'm butter  
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife  
He makes my heart a cinema scope  
He's showing the dancing bird of paradise  
  
(I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife)  
(I'm a hot knife, he's a pad of butter)  
(If I get a chance, I'm gonna show him that)  
(He's never gonna need another, never need another)  
  
If I'm butter, if I'm butter  
If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife
