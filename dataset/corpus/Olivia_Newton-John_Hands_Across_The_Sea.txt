And there'll be hands, hands across the sea  
Touching everybody, joining you and me  
If we could build a new horizon  
I'd like to see some changes made  
When nations hear the voice of reason  
And all the world live unafraid  
And there'll be hands, hands across the sea  
People joined as one, innocent and free  
And we'll have love, love and sympathy  
Touching everybody, joining you and me  
If we could share that new tomorrow  
You with your troubles, me with mine  
Then we could face the world together  
With open heart and easy mind  
And there'll be hands, hands across the sea  
People joined as one, innocent and free  
And we'll have love, love and sympathy  
Touching everybody, joining you and me  
Hands across the sea  
Hands across the sea
