Skulking in the mean streets whispering in the halls  
Red light bandits on the corner give no quarter calls  
Infectious garbage fills the streets and in their eyes you know  
A thin blue line bends and breaks stop the overflow  
  
Fan the flames of the city's heat  
In dark corners that you never seen  
Desperation when the trouble flares  
Alarm guns ring ("well I'm gonna scream") running scared  
  
And you're long gone, down in this hell  
Long gone down in this hell  
So baby won't you hold me tight  
Let your softness fill my night  
We've got a dream don't let it slip away  
In your eyes I can see the fear  
This town never sheds a tear  
We're gonna be out someday walking away  
  
People looking for the holy one,  
Some kind of hero or a prophet to come  
Visionaries dance the night away  
  
There's no tomorrow living for today  
But you're long gone down in this hell  
Long gone down in this hell  
  
I saw the stars come out tonight so lonely and immune  
Summer rain kissed the streets that bleed like open wounds ("old balloons")  
Patrol cars sweep the avenues down on forty eighth  
While faces in dark doorways wait to arouse the hate  
  
Fan the flames of the city's heat  
In dark corners that you never seen  
Desperation when the trouble flares  
Alarm guns ring ("well I'm gonna scream") running scared  
  
Baby better walk away  
Baby better walk away  
We'll be busting out someday  
  
Baby better walk away  
Baby better walk away  
We'll be busting out someday
