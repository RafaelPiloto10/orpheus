Hearken to me both high and low  
I'll sing for you a song  
Of Kings and Queens, and rose-lipped maidens  
Courting light foot lads  
  
Now love is grand, when love is new  
The heart blood, it runs strong  
There's nothing a doting lad won't do  
To keep his princess warm  
  
He'll tease her with poems and promises  
He'll ask her out to dance  
He'll cajole and he'll beg  
And he'll always win  
In bitter-sweet romance  
  
[Chorus]  
For time it comes, and time it goes  
It makes the strongest tree to bend  
Kings and Queens have no defence  
Time brings all things to an end.  
  
But he goes out, with his drinking pals  
His eyes begin to roam  
He forgets all about the brown-eyed beauty  
Who now, sits home alone  
  
There's no more walks, down lover's lane  
There's no more wine in the sun  
All that's left is a hollow pain  
Time, alas you've won  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now all who wish for love to stay  
And last your whole life through  
Keep ahead of time me boys  
And never be untrue  
  
[Chorus]
