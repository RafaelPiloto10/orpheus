I'll never forget you  
I'll never forget you  
I'll never forget how we promised one day  
To love one another forever that way  
We said we'd never say  
Good-bye  
  
But that was long ago  
Now you've forgotten, I know  
No use to wonder why  
Let's say farewell with a sigh  
Let love die  
  
But we'll go on living  
Our own way of living  
So you take the high road  
And I'll take the low  
It's time that we parted  
It's much better so  
But kiss me as you go  
Good-bye  
  
But we'll go on living  
Our own way of living  
So you take the high road  
And I'll take the low  
It's time that we parted  
It's much better so  
But kiss me as you go  
Good-bye  
Good-bye  
Good-bye
