She's a gold-plated lover  
Twenty-four carat cool  
She can walk on water  
She can walk in my room  
She's a one man woman  
and it's a one man race  
She's got a kiss like fire  
She burns the lips right off my face  
  
It's finder's keepers  
Loser's gonna weep  
She's personal, property  
Sealed 'n' stamped  
Money in the bank  
She's private  
For my eyes only  
  
[Chorus]  
She's personal property  
Personal property  
Personal service, personal touch  
Exclusively mine, thank you so much  
She's a heart stoppin', brain thuddin'  
Blood pumpin', knee tremblin'  
Spine crushin', tongue tyin'  
Personal property  
And she belongs to me  
  
She won't fall for nothin'  
She's much more than cute  
Don't mind why' window shoppin', that's all right  
But you ain't gonna taste  
My forbidden fruit  
  
Adios, au revoir,  
Wiedersehen, goodbye  
She's personal property  
Off limits, out of bounds  
Under lock 'n' key  
Confidential  
For my eyes only  
  
She's personal property  
Personal property  
Personal service, personal touch  
Exclusively mine, thank you so much  
She's a heart stoppin', brain thuddin'  
Blood pumpin', knee tremblin'  
Spine crushin', tongue tyin'  
  
She's mine, yeah  
  
Now I don't mind you guys checkin' her out  
You can whistle like a wolf  
Or you can mess around  
But let me tell you the secret  
Of the sweet life  
If you want to stay healthy, man  
Take my advice  
You better kit the road, Jack  
And don't come back!  
  
You could be king of the jungle  
Or you could swing in the rain  
But she don't need no monkey, not my babe  
Cause I'm her Tarzan and she's my Jane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And she's mine  
She belongs to me
