Everywhere I turn, I hurt someone  
But there's nothing I can say to change  
The things I've done  
Of all the things I hid from you  
I cannot hide the shame  
And I pray someone, something will come  
To take away the pain  
  
There's no way out of this dark place  
No hope, no future  
I know I can't be free  
But I can't see another way  
I can't face another day  
  
Tell me where, did I go wrong  
Everyone I loved, they're all gone  
I'd do everything so differently  
But I can't turn back the time  
There's no shelter from the storm  
Inside of me  
  
There's no way out of this dark place  
No hope, no future  
I know I can't be free  
But I can't see another way  
I can't face another day  
  
I can't believe the words I hear  
It's like an answer to a prayer  
When I look around I see  
This place, this time, this friend of mine  
  
I know it's hard but you  
Found somehow  
To look into your heart and  
To forgive me now  
You've given me the strength to see  
Just where my journey ends  
You've given me the strength  
To carry on  
  
I see the path from this dark place  
I see my future  
Your forgiveness has set me free  
On and I can see another way  
I can face another day!  
  
I see the path, I can see the path  
I see the future  
I see the path from this dark place  
I see the future  
  
I see the path, I can see the path  
I see the future
