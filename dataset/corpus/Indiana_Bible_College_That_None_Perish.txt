Chorus  
That none perish  
Is the will of God  
To redeem man from his sin  
He hung upon the cross  
That none perish  
But have everlasting life  
That the world may know  
The love of Christ  
  
Verse 1  
In every tribe and tongue  
There are those who don't know God  
The world must know that Jesus loves them so  
It is the master's plan  
To reach the soul of every man  
So He paid the final sacrifice  
On a cross with nail-scarred hands  
  
Bridge  
From far and near  
To every land  
The world must know about the Master's plan
