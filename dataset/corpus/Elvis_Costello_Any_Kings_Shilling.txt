You're a fine one, oh yes you are  
You're a fine one just like me  
And we're friends now, oh wouldn't you say?  
We've been friends now, oh haven't we?  
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you  
I can't say more it would be telling  
For if you don't what will become of you  
Just isn't worth any king's shilling  
  
I will answer when they make that call, pull upon this ragged uniform  
Up 'til now I know it's been your trade  
Spit and polish the potato parade  
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you  
I can't say more it would be telling  
For if you don't what will become of you  
Just isn't worth any king's shilling  
  
Please don't put your silly head in that pretty soldier's hat  
You've done your duty, that's enough of that  
  
I don't know if what I'm doing is right  
I don't know if you should be forgiving  
But for me it seems it means my life  
While for you it could just be a living  
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you  
I can't say more it would be telling  
For if you don't what will become of you  
Just isn't worth any king's shilling  
  
Please don't put your silly head in that British soldier's hat  
You've done your duty that's enough of that  
  
You're a fine one, oh yes you are  
You're a fine one, just like me
