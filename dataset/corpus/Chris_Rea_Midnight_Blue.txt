I got my money  
I got it here in my hand  
OK let me tell you  
This is how we stand  
I've waited so long  
Good things, never too late  
So don't take no chances  
Leave nothing to faith  
  
I want to walk tall in midnight blue  
Look good, oh so good  
Step out in midnight blue  
Midnight blue  
  
I watch the razors with their class and their style  
Dressed to kill, man  
Their lives is just one great big smile  
And oh I want to be there  
When they dish that stuff out  
Cool and collected  
Man that's what it's all about  
  
So gimme, gimme, gimme  
I want midnight blue  
I love midnight blue  
I'm gonna step out in midnight blue  
So gimme, gimme, gimme midnight blue  
Midnight blue  
I walk tall in midnight blue  
Look good, oh so good  
In midnight blue
