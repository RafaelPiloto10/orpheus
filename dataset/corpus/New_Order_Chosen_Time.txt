One day it's now or never  
To stay at home  
Sometimes the dreams are better  
One thing you hold  
Believe that all these changes  
Keep me alone  
What brought the last reaction  
I'll never know  
I'll never know  
I'll never know  
  
Believe me, all I said to you  
Believe me, all I did for you  
All I did for you  
All the times it takes to complain  
But live in doubt  
Sometimes they keep you waiting  
For a look around  
I've got a friend in here somewhere  
Who can help me out  
Believe me, all I said to you  
Believe me, all I did for you  
All I did for you
