Did you think you knew the game?  
Did you think that fame and fortune's  
All that I had in my head?  
Bang you're dead  
It's not a game I'm gonna play with you  
  
Did you think I'm high and dry?  
Did you think I'd hide from the  
Tentacles of the deaf dumb and blind  
Their poison inks behind me  
At the bottom of the sea  
And your criticism doesn't worry me  
And I'll sing  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
Get out  
Did you think you'd tie me up  
Did you think that I would  
Help but dance for your piece of paper  
They'll tame you and set you  
To licking all the foes  
Zap! pow!  
  
Did you think that I don't feel  
Did you think that I'd simply heal up  
After each ego beating  
We can't go on meeting  
This once in every year  
And in the meantime if we all stand up  
And cheer him up here  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
They all took their money out  
And they laid it down, down  
On the bright colored manes  
They all took their money out  
But they laid it down, down  
On the different names to ours  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact
