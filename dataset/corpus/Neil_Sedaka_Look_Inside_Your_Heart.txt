If you need my love and you don't know why to do  
Cause you heard they are been running no rout  
If you're wandering if those stories are really too  
And you're wandering just were I can be found  
  
Just look inside your heart because there is wear I will be  
I wearing helped you, no mere what to do  
Why can't you fight me  
Just look inside your heart my darling and than you will see  
You are the only one  
My love in daisy dark  
That's all the high me  
Remember  
  
When the parties of one more lonely night again  
And you want to cry because you're love  
When you want my heart to make it all right again  
All you have to do his working your all  
Your all  
  
Just look inside your heart because there is wear I will be  
I wearing helped you, no mere what to do  
Why can't you fight me  
Just look inside your heart my darling and than you will see  
You are the only one  
My love in daisy dark  
That's all the high me  
Remember  
  
When the parties of one more lonely night again  
And you want to cry because you're love  
When you want my heart to make it all right again  
All you have to do his working your all  
Your all  
  
Oh, look inside your heart  
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh  
Just look inside your heart  
[Fade out]  
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh  
Look inside your heart...
