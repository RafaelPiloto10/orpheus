I don't know what he does to make you cry,  
But I'll be there to make you smile.  
I don't have a fancy car,  
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles.  
I don't care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know  
But if you were my girl  
I'd make it so we'd never be apart.  
  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you, but  
Love is all I have to give  
  
When you talk-does it seem like he's not  
Even listening to a word you say?  
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems  
I'll try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most?  
Does his friends get all your time?  
Baby please, I'm on my knees  
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!!  
  
To you, hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more-inside  
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love  
I have inside, I Love You  
  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give  
Everything I have is for you  
But love is all I have to give
