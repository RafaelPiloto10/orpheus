You and me, sittin' in the back of my memory  
Like a honey bee buzzin' 'round a glass of sweet Chablis  
Radio's on, windows rolled up and my mind's rolled down  
Headlights shining like silver moon's rollin' on the ground  
We made love in every way love can be made  
And we made time, look like time could never fade  
Friday Night, we both made the guitar hum  
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again  
Soul to soul, heart to heart and cheek to cheek  
Now, come on, baby, give me a kiss that'll last all week  
The thought of you leavin' again brings me down  
The promise of your sweet love brings me around  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end  
It's gonna be a long Monday  
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again and again
