So long to you, hope I don't make you blue,  
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.  
Apart we've grown, now I can't go on alone.  
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.  
  
Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.  
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.  
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.  
  
I bow my head, cause in the mornin' I'm a gonna be dead.  
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.  
  
Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.  
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.  
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.
