In your time  
The innocence will fall away  
In your time  
The mission bells will toll  
All along  
The corridors and river beds  
There'll be sign  
In your time  
  
Towering waves  
Will crash across your southern capes  
Massive storms  
Will reach your eastern shores  
Fields of green  
  
Will tumble through your summer days  
By design  
In your time  
  
Feel the wind  
And set yourself the bolder course  
Keep your heart  
As open as a shrine  
You'll sail the perfect line  
  
And after all  
The dead ends and the lessons learned  
After all  
The stars have turned to stone  
There'll be peace  
Across the great unbroken void  
All benign  
In your time  
You'll be fine  
In your time
