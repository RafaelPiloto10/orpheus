85 miles out of Nashville, thinkin' bout  
The way things change  
Try an keep it by the reigns  
I'm a lone drifter, big money flipper  
Take anything you got on the rocks in snifter  
I missed her in Kentucky, went down to Louisiana  
I never had no lovin' like I had in Alabama  
A man of my word ain't out to hurt nobody  
I'm just a M see to keep the boogie in the party  
Been singin' lodi dodi since 84  
And I'll be singin' lodi dodi 'til I'm 84  
I couldn't ask for more, life's been sweet  
So you can save the planet,  
I'll save your seat  
  
I been gone for weeks, I ain't slept days  
I can't find myself in this self made maze  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
I never thought about change until  
Spend a little time where time stood still  
Been lookin' for a mill but I keep comin' up shy  
I been a broke fool, I ain't tryin' to be that guy  
Want to ride like lightning, roll like thunder  
I'm tryin' to get some money, I ain't getting any younger  
At times I wonder, at times I won't  
Sometimes I give a fuck but most times I don't  
  
even care, through stained glass windows these eyes stare  
I try to stay straight but it's kickin' my ass  
Every time I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past  
I sit half mass like a soldier's flag  
That's why my left leg limps and my Dickies sag  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
Well I been around this crooked land  
I come across walks, I shook Jim Beam's hand  
I got no plans and no place to go  
It keep getting harder to just say no  
I see the people laugh and people cry  
That's how some live and that's how some die  
Well me myself I'm gonna sit right here  
And I'm a watch this world break down in tears  
All my fears and dark grey skies  
Couldn't crack my smile or break my stride  
Got too much pride, I got too much shout  
I might be down but I still ain't out  
Got too much time and that's all I have  
When I leave this world I'll still be sad  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin', to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way
