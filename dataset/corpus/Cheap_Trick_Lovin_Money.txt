Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  
Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  
There's a lot of things that seem to go 'round  
Like the world the love and the fun  
There's a lot of things that seem to go 'round  
Like the girls and the love I get numb  
Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'  
Lovin', lovin', I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin' 'bout lovin'
