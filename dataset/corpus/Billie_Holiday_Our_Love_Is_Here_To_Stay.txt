The more I read the papers  
The less I comprehend  
The world with all its capers  
And how it all will end.  
Nothing seems to be lasting.  
But that isn't our affair,  
We've got something permanent,  
I mean in the way we care.  
  
It's very clear  
Our love is here to stay,  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day.  
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies,  
And in time may go.  
But, oh my dear,  
Our love is here to stay,  
Together we're going a long, long way.  
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble,  
They're only made of clay,  
But our love is here to stay.
