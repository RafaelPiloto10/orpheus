It's been a long time since I've been spoken to you  
Was it the right time?  
Your current troubles and you know they'll get much worse  
I hope you know how much I enjoyed them  
You're a pig of a person, there's a justice in this world  
Hey, how about this?  
Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality  
Well, more and more people know all about it  
  
We sat around the other night, me and the guys,  
Trying to find the right word  
That would best fit and describe you and people like you  
That no principle has touched no principles baptized  
How about that?  
Who'd eat shit and say it taseted good  
If there was some money in it for him  
Hey, you remember that song by this guy from Texas  
Whose name was Bobby Fuller?  
I'll sing it for you it went like this  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won
