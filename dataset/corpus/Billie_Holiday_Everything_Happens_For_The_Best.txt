Always blue all in a mist  
It's plain as can be  
You're so mean to me  
But everything happens for the best  
You always play around  
You're running my heart so deep in the ground  
That O.K. everything happens for the best  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best  
  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
It's over all over because we're through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best
