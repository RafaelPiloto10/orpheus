Leaves were falling ..just like embers  
In colors red and gold they set us on fire  
Burning just like a moonbeam ..in our eyes  
Chorus:  
Somebody said they saw me  
Swinging the world by the tail  
Bouncing over a white cloud.  
Killing the blues  
I am guilty of something  
I hope you never do because there is nothing  
Sadder than losing .. yourself in love  
Repeat chorus:  
Repeat chorus:  
Now, you ask me just to leave you  
To go out on my own and get what I need to  
You want me to find ..what I've already had  
Repeat chorus:  
Repeat chorus:  
Repeat chorus:  
Repeat chorus:
