Quite some time, I been sittin' it out  
Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt  
I knocked down the wailin' wall, it ain't no sin  
I, got, the feel of fortune, deal me in  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm comin' straight on for you  
You made my mind  
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through,  
Straight on, straight on for you,  
Straight on for you  
  
Now, I know, I got to play my hand  
What the winner don't know, the gambler understands  
My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend  
I'll take my chances on you, again and again, again  
  
[Chorus]
