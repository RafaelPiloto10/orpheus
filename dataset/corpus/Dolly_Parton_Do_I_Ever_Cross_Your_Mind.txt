Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked  
Long ago in the sweet used to be  
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet  
As they did when you picked them for me  
Chorus:  
  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever think back on old memories like that  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night  
Because you miss me, do you darling  
Oh, and do your memories ever take  
You back into another place in time  
And do you ever miss the feelings  
And the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darling  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss  
Your sweet lips like I did long ago  
And how often I long for those two loving arms  
That once held me so gentle and close  
  
Repeat chorus
