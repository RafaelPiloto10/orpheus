There came a girl from France  
Who didn't know how to dance  
The only thing that she could do  
Was knees up Mother Brown  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Knees up Mother Brown  
Knees up Mother Brown  
Knees up, knees up, never let the breeze  
Up  
Knees up Mother Brown.  
  
Oh, hopping on one foot,  
Hopping on one foot,  
Hopping, hopping, never stopping  
Hopping on one foot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, prancing up and down  
Prancing up and down  
Prancing, prancing, never dancing  
Prancing up and down  
  
And whirling round and round,  
Whirling round and round  
Whirling, whirling, never twirling  
Whirling round and round  
  
(Repeat chorus)
