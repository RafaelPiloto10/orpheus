Sometimes I listen to what people try to say  
And then when I tune in I think no that's not the way  
Sometimes I listen to what people have to say  
And then when I tune in I think no that's not the way  
  
It must be the music  
It sounds so confusing  
It must be the music  
That's opening my eyes  
It must be the music  
It sounds so confusing  
It must be the music  
Making me satisfied
