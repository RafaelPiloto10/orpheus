I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack  
Just a little shanty by the railroad track  
Freight train was it taught me how to cry  
Hummin' of the driver was my lullaby  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my old ma here,  
She was the only daughter of the engineer  
My sweetheart loved a brakeman and it ain't no joke  
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again  
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train  
Every place I want to go  
I never can go, because you know  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.
