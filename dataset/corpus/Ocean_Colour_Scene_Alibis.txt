You told so many lies, your tongue is black with fireflies  
But you spit them out and pretend you're sneezing  
And every word is such a joke  
With so many pasts you'd be ninety years old  
Don't you wonder why the room keeps on leaving  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would never need it  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would ever believe it  
It's just a thought and nothing more  
That all your thoughts and moves are taught  
And memorized each night before your sleeping  
And every word is such a joke  
Strung from neon masts flying flags you hope  
Will win you friends and give your life some meaning  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would never need it  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would ever believe it  
You told so many lies, your tongue is stained with alibis  
You've been around the world and found it pleasing  
And every word is such a joke  
With so many pasts you'd be a hundred years old  
Don't you wonder why the room keeps on leaving  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would never need it  
Hey, hey, what's that I heard you say  
Don't think that I would ever believe it
