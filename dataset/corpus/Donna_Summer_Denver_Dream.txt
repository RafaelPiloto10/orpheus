The Denver dream  
Colorado girl  
Denver!  
Denver!  
  
You were just a young girl the  
Well I know your story well  
Your parents died and left you  
Just a name and little else  
  
You split from Colorado  
You left without a word  
I guess I should have hated you  
But I loved you even more  
  
Denver dream  
So you're the one they called  
Denver dream  
Colorado girl  
Denver dream  
So you're the one they called

Colorado girl  
Denver!  
Denver!  
  
Quite a change come over you  
But then you're a woman now  
See just how you earned your name  
Your beauty conquered all  
  
Denver dream I've missed you  
It's been a long long time  
Since the day we've been apart  
You've been on my mind  
  
Say you're not sure whom I am  
Then cast your thoughts do Denver  
'cause I'm the girl you left so lost  
Yes I'm your little sister  
I'm your sister!  
  
Denver dream
