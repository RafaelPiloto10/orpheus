The fortune queen of New Orleans,  
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine  
On the backseat were scratches from  
The marks of men her fortune she had won  
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,  
She said "home James" and he hit the gas  
I followed her to some darkened room,  
She took my money, she said "I'll be with you soon"  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three  
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me  
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,  
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black  
She said the man you love is secretly true  
To someone else who is very close to you  
My advice is that you leave this place,  
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
So I ran home and crawled in my bed,  
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said  
Then I remembered her strange perfume,  
And how I smelled it was in my own room!  
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,  
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand  
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,  
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself
