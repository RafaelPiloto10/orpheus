Voices, I hear the people calling  
Deep in my dreams  
Choices, I made my own they've fallen  
Apart with their screams  
  
Waiting for my time  
Oh Lord, please forgive me  
Waiting for a hero,  
An angel relieve me  
  
In a land after life,  
I'll give my sacrifice  
In a world of dignity  
There is no need to flee  
  
In a land after time  
I'll give my sacrifice  
In a world of glory skies  
There is no need to die  
  
Chances, I took enough to fight it  
  
All through my life  
Advances, I had them all and lost 'em  
They're out of my sight  
  
Waiting for my time  
Oh Lord, please forgive me  
Waiting for a hero,  
An angel relieve me  
  
In a land after life,  
I'll give my sacrifice  
In a world of dignity  
There is no need to flee  
  
In a land after time  
I'll give my sacrifice  
In a world of glory skies  
There is no need to die
