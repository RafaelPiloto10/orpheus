Ooh  
(Give a good heart, give a good heart,  
Give a good heart, give a good heart)  
  
When it seems that all hope is gone  
And so called friends aren't there to rely on  
When the darkness makes it so hard to see  
Just lift up your eyes, you will see me, yeah  
  
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong  
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on, yeah  
Gonna give a good heart, that's solid and true  
And I will always stand by you  
  
When it seems no one's there to turn to  
Everyone's a stranger passing through  
And all that's left is a broken dream  
Just hold out your hand, reach out for me, yeah  
  
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong  
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on, yeah  
Give a good heart, that's solid and true  
And I will always stand by you  
  
Now there's no need to dance alone  
In these arms you found your home  
  
Ooh, whoa oh oh, give a good heart  
Take my good heart, take my good heart  
Take my good heart  
  
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong  
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on, yeah  
Gonna give a good heart, that's solid and true  
I will always stand by you  
  
Give a good heart, hold you so strong  
Give you my shoulder to lean on  
Gonna give a good heart, hold you're head up  
So lift you're head up, lift it up  
I'll show you a love to believe in, yeah  
  
I will always stand by you  
Take my good heart  
  
Give a good heart, hold you so strong  
Give you my shoulder to lean on  
Gonna give a good heart, solid and true  
I will always stand by you
