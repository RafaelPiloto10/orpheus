My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
No more grief and pain for me  
I heard from Heaven today  
Yes, my Lord's gonna set me free  
I heard from Him today  
  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
Oh, my Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
On my way to the promised land  
I heard from Him today  
God's gonna give me His right hand  
I heard from Heaven today  
  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
Oh, my Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall
