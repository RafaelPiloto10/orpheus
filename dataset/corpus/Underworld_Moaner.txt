Hey kiss me I kiss you  
Kiss me I kiss you  
I know about you  
I've been told about you  
I've been waiting for you  
And the air's thin  
Tiny holes  
  
And everybody wants to know you  
Is rapt like moon river  
Then beyond the blinds  
The new white slacks alight  
Sliding into the city  
Tunnel beneath the feet of the people in the city  
Roamin' roamin' roamin' in the city  
And crossway boy  
Crossway boy  
Downtown waterfront boy  
And the shadows where the ambi and the motor meet  
And she's on the phone again  
Surfin' she's on the phone again  
She's calling from America  
She's calling from America  
She's surfin' she's moshing  
And the girls are diving and the girls are up to something  
Animal boy thing up on the roof again  
Boy thing lookin'down there  
And there's every kind of lack  
To make it down to the Delaware  
And up in your head  
And moaner moaner moaner moaner  
Rudy get the get the get the get the get the  
Night the city loves you  
City loves a boyfriend  
Love walks with a boyfriend  
A city loves a boyfriend  
Friends walking with a boyfriend  
And the night's with a boyfriend  
And the city loves you loves you loves you  
Loves everyone  
Everyone is smiling  
The smiling is pushing it around  
It's pushing it around  
Like shadows in the evolution in the dark  
And the super boys  
Where time is all where time is everything  
Where time of all this started  
As we're turned to earth earth wind and fire  
Get the sound in your head  
Black metal walls are crawling  
I am the hunger above your town  
A little sound in a little amp  
I am dubious hard metal I am stainless  
I am milk in your plastic  
I am wrapped in this left alone  
In a full moon with  
The only thing I can do  
Lying awake on the floor  
At night the doors I can't I can't awake I can't awake  
Ah ah ah ah  
Water into you to me constantly  
Constantly  
Without without without without again without again  
Your telephone number  
Through the glass of water  
The instance between is opened  
The silence is indifferent and your love love love  
Love walks with the boyfriend  
The city loves a boyfriend  
Friends walking  
Friends walking with a boyfriend  
The city loves a boyfriend  
Everybody loves a boyfriend  
You left me alone you left me alone  
With a full moon  
Full moon full moon full moon full moon full moon  
Boys boys boys boys  
Cross crossway crossway boy  
Down on the waterfront
