I like schoolgirls and lollipops  
White socks and lemon drops  
Stack heels and knotted ties  
Tight jeans and painted eyes  
Girls dressed in hockey gear  
School days are always here  
Yeah, I'm out of control  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind saying  
It's gonna be a good one tonight  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind waiting  
For what you call a bit of alright  
I'm out of control  
I like big girls and Spiderman  
Deep water and Paris tan  
Short skirts and lace-up flies  
Long grass and starry nights  
All girls in navy blue  
Here's what we think of you  
Yeah, we're out of control  
We're out of control  
And I don't mind saying  
It's gonna be a good one tonight  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind waiting  
For what you call a bit of alright  
I'm out of control  
I like blonde hair and sailor's tops  
Fish tights and prison crops  
Long tongues and docker's grips  
Pony tails and sinking ships  
Swim suits and judo gear  
Look out the boys are here  
Singing we're out of control  
We're out of control  
And I don't mind saying  
It's gonna be a good one tonight  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind waiting  
For what you call a bit of alright  
I'm out of control
