Hello dear there somthin' on my mind  
There somethin' between us I can't find  
Can please please show me the light  
Because with you I refuse to fight  
  
It's cause you have a new girlfriend  
She gives you better head then me  
It's cause that guy that you hide  
I heard he can make you scream  
  
I guess I'm a shmo  
You have better people to fuck then me  
I guess that I'm the jerk  
That lets you fuck who ever you please  
  
We used to have such good times  
You lay before me as I tell you my mind  
I listen as you talk about some girl  
You said some day she'd be your wife  
  
I guess I'm a shmo  
You have better people to fuck then me  
I guess that I'm the jerk  
That lets you fuck who ever you please  
  
  
By the way Bitch! You kiss my god damn ass  
Eat shit and die you dirty fuckin' slut  
Fuck off you stupid fuckin' cunt  
I hope you choke on toxicshock  
You fuckin' Duchebag
