Your bad self..  
[Verse 1]  
All right, stop, spread yourself around  
Get loose girl, let's break it down  
Get down, straight to the floor  
Get excited and beg for more  
As I go on, flow on with a smile  
Pay attention to my style  
Dirty but hot, ya' know what I mean?  
Get loose girl like a sex fiend, let's do it  
cause you know what I want  
Me and you babe go one on one  
Get freaky and I do the same  
Get hot and I ride like a sex machine  
[Chorus]  
Ice cool and you're colder than ever, I like it  
Ice cool and you're colder than ever  
[Verse 2]  
Ice cold, cooler than ever  
Never say never cause I'm so damn clever  
Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips  
V.i.p. posse and we're pimps  
Be on the lookout in your vicinity  
I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity  
Like robin hood gave to the poor  
I rock kashla and now she wants more  
She calls everday, it's gettin' kinda' silly  
But she rides my saddle like bronco billy  
In a rodeo somewhere out west  
She screams out "vanilla ice, you're the best!"  
Echoing out, can you hear?  
She screams out everywhere  
Just a pimp and you know  
Snatchin' women, so, yo!  
You can beg, plead and tell me you love me  
But there's no way i'd put a girl above me  
Unless it's sex and you want to' ride  
Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Move your body all around  
This is the dope jam, so get down  
Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it  
This is the jam and vanilla just did it  
I made you work 'til your butt got sore  
In other words, I'm about to get raw  
On stage, it's a v.i.p., doin' dances from a to zpumpin' it, pushin' it, stick
it hard  
I freaked your girl in the back of your car  
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on  
Popped a rubber duckie, so bought me a trojan  
Get ready, hyped into the groove  
As I practiced to make your body move  
You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin'  
Vanilla ice is here so you suckers start runnin'  
This is the jam I know you're gonna like  
Deshay he cuts like a knife  
He won't smirk and he won't smile  
Deshay get funky for a while  
Yo, it's time for me to pump, pump..  
Pump up the volume  
[Chorus]
