Southern nights  
have you ever felt a southern night?  
Free as a breeze  
not to mention the trees  
Whistling tunes that you know and love so.  
  
Southern nights  
just as good even when closed your eyes.  
I apologize to anyone who can truly say  
That he has found a better way  
  
Southern skies  
have you ever noticed southern skies?  
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye.  
It goes running through your soul  
Like the stories told of old  
Old man  
he and his dog that walked the old land  
Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand.  
As he slowly walked by  
weeping willows  
Would cry for joy  
Joy  
  
Feel so good  
feel so good  
it's frigth'ning.  
Wish I could,  
stop this world from fighting.  
La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da  
  
Mysteries  
like this and many others in the trees  
Blow in the night  
in the southern skies.  
  
Southern nights  
they feel so good it's fright'ning . . .  
Wish I could stop this world from fighting  
La da da da da da la da da da da da  
da da da da da da da da da da da
