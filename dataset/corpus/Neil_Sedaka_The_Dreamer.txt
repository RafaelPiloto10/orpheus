[Hush hush a bye  
Hush hush a bye-bye] x4  
  
The dreamer  
Silly dreamer  
They all call me  
Since I met you  
  
Every friend I have, girl  
Called you bad girl  
And they told me  
To forget you  
  
They said to me  
Foolish little dreamer  
Why can't you see  
She's a fickle schemer  
She'll take your heart  
Thinking it's a joke  
And break it apart  
Laughing when it's broken, too  
  
But I don't care  
Because in my dream world you are my dream girl  
So my prayer  
Goes out to each little sheep to keep me asleep  
The dreamer  
Silly dreamer  
They all called me  
Soon they'll all see  
They were wrong about you  
Wrong to doubt you  
Darling, we'll show them  
How dreams come true  
(Repeat)
