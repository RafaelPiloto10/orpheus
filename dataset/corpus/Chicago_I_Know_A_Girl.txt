Velma:  
Can you imagine?  
I mean can you imagine?  
Do you believe it?  
I mean, do you believe it?  
  
I know a girl  
A girl who lands on top  
You could put her face  
Into a pail of slop  
And she'd come up smelling like a rose  
How she does it, heaven knows.  
  
Reporter:  
Hold on, everybody, she's comin' out now.  
(Roxie enters, followed by a very happy Doctor.)  
Well, Doctor, is she or isn't she?  
  
Velma:  
She is.  
  
Doctor:  
She is!  
  
Velma:  
I know a girl  
A girl with so much luck  
She could get run over by a two-ton truck  
Then brush herself off and walk away  
How she does it, I couldn't say  
  
Billy:  
So, Doc, would you swear to that statement in court?  
  
Doctor:  
Oh, yeah.  
  
Billy:  
Good... You wanna button your fly?  
  
Velma:  
Whilst I on the other hand  
Put my face in a pail of slop  
And I would smell like a pail of slop  
I, on the other hand  
Get run over by a truck  
And I am deader than a duck  
  
I know a girl who tells so many lies  
Anything that's true would truly cross her eyes  
But what that mouse is selling  
That whole world buys  
And nobody smells a rat.  
  
Roxie:  
Oh, please Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - leave the two  
Of us alone so that we can rest.  
  
Velma:  
The two of us?  
Can you imagine?  
I mean, can you imagine?  
  
Reporter:  
Can I have one last picture, please?  
  
Roxie:  
Oh, sure, anything for the press.  
  
Velma:  
Do you believe it?  
I mean, do you believe it?  
  
Roxie:  
My dear little baby  
  
Velma:  
"My dear little baby."  
  
Roxie:  
My sweet little baby  
  
Velma:  
"My sweet little..."  
  
Roxie:  
Look at my baby and me!
