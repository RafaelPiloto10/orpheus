Stand up, stand on your own, that's what they tell me  
You can make it alone, but where does it say I have to move  
Far away from you to prove I'm strong,  
Oh when all it really proves is I'm lonely without you  
  
And loneliness has to be wrong, I live for your love, (everyday), every minute  
I live for your love, (in my life), want you in it  
I live for your love, I admit it, I live for your love  
I wake up with no one to kiss, sometimes I wonder, (wonder, wonder) if I just
exist  
  
I know there are people I can see, places I could be, and friends who call  
Oh but what good does it do, there's no substitute for you  
I want you or nothing at all, I live for your love, (every day), every minute  
I live for your love, (in my life), want you in it, I live for your love, I
admit it  
I live for your love and your kisses, and know how I'm missing  
  
Your sweet tender touch, (tender touch), I need you so much  
That I just can't go on anymore, what I wouldn't give for  
'Cause darling I live for your love, (Everyday), every minute  
I live for your love, (Got one life) want you in it  
I live for your love, I hate to admit it, but oh, I live for, I'd die for  
  
What I wouldn't give for your love, (I live for your love every day)  
I live for your love, (got one life) every day, every minute  
(I live for your love), I have only got one life, I want you in it  
Oh, my baby, yes, yes, I live for your love, ooh, ooh
