Locked up in chains, backs to the wall  
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call  
Pushed from outside, thrown underground  
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I feel something coming  
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.  
  
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death  
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet  
Ready to fight to get what we need  
Die on your feet or live on your knees.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I feel something coming  
Looks like a riot in the dungeon  
You stand and die or start your running  
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.  
  
It's got to give, it's gonna break  
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake  
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood  
We won't give in till they've had enough.
