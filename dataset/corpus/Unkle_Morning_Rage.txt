Something burns inside me, man  
Can't explain, won't understand  
Anger, rage and war crime  
Fear, fate and lullabies  
  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
  
Something burns inside me, man  
Won't explain, can't understand  
Seeking truth for someone's eyes  
Crowded lows and lonely highs  
  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
  
What was it all about?  
Something's turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
'Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
What was it all about?  
Something's turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
'Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
Something burns inside me, man  
Don't explain, won't understand  
Darling please don't walk away  
Frozen hearts don't like to say  
  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
  
What was it all about?  
Something's turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
'Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
What was it all about?  
Something's turned me inside out  
So I put myself around  
'Cause you pull me in then turn me out  
  
Nothing lasts forever, man  
Nothing lasts forever, and  
Nothing lasts forever, man  
Nothing lasts forever, and  
  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up  
I wake up, I wake up
