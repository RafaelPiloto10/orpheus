Well, your love is supernatural  
Got a hold on me like I'm hypnotized  
You don't have to say a word  
Every time you look at me  
I can see it all in your eyes  
Well, I know you put a spell on me  
How you make me think about you all the time  
I can almost hear your voice  
Even though you're far away  
I can feel you right by my side  
I can read your mind  
What you want me to do  
Darlin', deep in your heart  
I see the truth  
Now I know you got the magic touch  
When you hold me now I can see the truth  
All the secrets of the heart  
You can't hide them any more  
I can feel the power in you  
I can read your mind  
What you want me to do  
Darlin', deep in your heart  
I see the truth  
I can read your mind  
What you want me to be  
To keep our love alive  
You must be willing to believe  
In a love that will last  
And I know you realize  
I can see it in your eyes  
Now our love will never die  
I can read your mind  
Well, your love is supernatural  
Got a hold on me like I'm hypnotized  
You don't have to say a word  
Every time you look at me  
I can see it all in your eyes  
Well, your love is supernatural  
Got a hold on me like I'm hypnotized  
You don't have to say a word  
Every time you look at me  
I can see it all in your eyes  
Well, your love is supernatural  
Got a hold on me like I'm hypnotized  
You don't have to say a word  
Every time you look at me  
I can see it all in your eyes  
I can read your mind  
I can read your mind  
I can read your mind
