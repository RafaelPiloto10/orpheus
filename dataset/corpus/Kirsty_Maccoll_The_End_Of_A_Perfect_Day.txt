I want to tell you something  
It's not a secret or anything  
You're not alone in being alone  
At the end of a perfect day  
  
And if you leave all your dependents  
Then they will gain their independence  
Don't make a martyr of yourself  
It's just the end of a perfect day  
  
And it's never how it seems  
The rain may fall on the best laid schemes  
But in a written testimonial I'd say  
I never really knew you anyway  
  
I want to tell you something  
Now don't go crazy or anything  
Just want to tell you that it's over  
It's the end of a perfect day  
  
Do you want sign language?  
Don't want a knuckle sandwich!  
Now you can love or you can hate it's just  
The end of a perfect day  
  
You can't get inside someone  
So don't ask me if we're close  
I really couldn't tell you  
But I know you wouldn't really listen anyway  
  
It's a pain you have to bear  
And it's always going to be there  
But if you disappeared tomorrow  
Then the world would carry on without you anyway  
  
Mind over matter it seems  
Can stop you falling apart at the seams  
It's a matter of honour with me  
I could write out a hundred times  
  
Put my hand on my heart and say  
That I don't want to lie  
Don't want to lie  
Don't want to lie  
About the way it is  
  
I want to tell you something  
Don't act surprised now or anything  
Now you can revel in yourself 'cause  
It's just the end of a perfect day  
  
No it's not a pretty world out there  
With people dying of their own despair  
But in a written testimonial you'd say  
You never really knew them anyway
