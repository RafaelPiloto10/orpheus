All I ever wanted  
Was a love to be true  
More than just enough to get me by  
I want a love to see me through  
  
I don't need another well spent night  
Another clever, sideways glance  
I wanna look my baby in the eye  
And know there's nothin' left to chance  
  
Well if you're tired of being lonely  
Beat up and confused  
Darlin' there is only  
One thing you can do  
Come to me  
I'll be the one who's waiting  
Come to me  
I got what you need  
Won't you come to me  
There won't be no hesitating  
I know what you mean to me  
  
I'm gonna hold out for the one I want  
Ain't gonna settle for less  
Cause the kind of love I'm lookin' for, baby  
You can't fake, you can't finesse  
  
I ain't lookin' for the kind of man, baby  
Can't stand a little shaky ground  
He'll give me fire and tenderness  
And got the guts to stick around  
  
So if you're tired of bein' lonely  
Beat up and confused  
Darlin' there is only  
One thing you can do  
Come to me  
I got what you need  
Come to me  
Won't be no hesitating  
I know what you mean to me
