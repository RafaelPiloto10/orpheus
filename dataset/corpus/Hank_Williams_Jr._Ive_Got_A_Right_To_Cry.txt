I've got a right to cry  
I've got a right to cry  
All day I sing the blues  
I'm in my lonely shoes  
  
Could you be so unkind?  
I nearly lost my mind  
I wonder if you care  
My life is a sad affair  
  
My heart is aching and it's breaking  
And I don't know what to do  
Sweetheart, it's all because of you  
  
You know you've done done me wrong  
Come on back home where you belong  
And in this reason why  
I've got a right to cry  
  
Yeah my heart is aching, Lord, it's breaking  
And I don't know what to do  
Sweetheart, don't you know it's all because of you?  
  
You know you've done done me wrong  
Please come back home where you belong  
And in my reason why  
I've got a right to cry  
I've got a right to cry
