If you think it's over, better think again  
There'll be no compromise  
Time to hit the power, feel adrenaline  
Move into overdrive  
  
Here comes the revolution  
Time for retribution  
  
If you think I'll back down or accept defeat  
Brace for the aftershock  
Take it to the limits, take it to the streets  
Give it everything you've got  
  
Time to come together  
Revolution  
Living on forever  
Revolution  
  
Get ready for the revolution  
  
It's a revolution  
It's a retribution  
  
Something's in the air  
Time to change, it's time to change  
  
You better watch out tonight  
You better watch out for the revolution  
  
Bring it down, bring it down
