Choo choo Moma, won't you ride the train?  
My life without you is just misery and pain, come back to me  
I'll treat you best I can  
Choo choo Moma, you should have a choo choo man  
  
Choo choo Moma, won't you ride a rail?  
I need your loving, can't you hear me wail, come back to me  
You know I love you so  
Choo choo Moma, won't you get a choo choo home?  
  
Choo choo Moma, won't you ride the track?  
I need your loving, won't you bring some back on home to me  
I need your loving, babe  
Choo choo Moma, don't you know you drive me mad?  
  
Choo choo Moma, you're a cheery thing  
I love you, baby, can't you help me sing, come back to me  
I want you back again  
Choo choo Moma, won't you get a choo choo train?
