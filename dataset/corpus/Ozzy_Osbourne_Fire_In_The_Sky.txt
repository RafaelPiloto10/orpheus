The introduction to his heartache began as a child  
So it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild.  
So he protected his feelings in walls he imagined  
But castles crumble exposing the frightened child.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
In solitude he couldn't deal with his own existence,  
The burning questions in the castles have still remained.  
God only knows how he searched in vain for the answers,  
Now castles crumble exposing his naked flames, yeah.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.
