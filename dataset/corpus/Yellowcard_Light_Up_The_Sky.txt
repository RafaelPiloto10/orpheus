You're making a choice to live like this  
And all of the noise - I am silence  
We already know how it ends tonight  
You run in the dark through a firefight  
And I would explode just to save your life  
Yeah, I would explode  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
  
I can't find a wall to pin this to  
They're all coming down since I've found you  
I just wanna be where you are tonight  
I run in the dark looking for some light  
And how will we know if we just don't try  
We won't ever know  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me make this mine  
I'll ignite for you  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Just for you tonight  
Let me help you fly  
'Cause you won't have time  
To cover your eyes  
Or get your disguise  
They won't ask you why  
They'll just watch you die  
  
And it's still so hard to be who you are  
So you play this part  
And the show goes on  
But you've come this far with a broken heart  
Yeah, you've come this far  
And you're broken  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me make this mine  
I'll ignite for you  
I'll ignite for you  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Light it up for you  
Let me tell you why  
I would die for you  
  
And it's still so hard to be who you are  
But you've come this far with a broken heart  
And it's still so hard to be who you are  
But you've come this far and you're broken  
  
Let me light up the sky  
Let me light up the sky
