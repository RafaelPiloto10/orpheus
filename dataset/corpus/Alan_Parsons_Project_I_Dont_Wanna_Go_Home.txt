"Go back home", you damn fool  
Surely you know you can't win  
You should've never have come near this place  
You should have stayed outside  
(Lookin' up)  
It's too late to turn back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But they blinded you with diamonds  
And all the money that money can buy  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own  
But I don't wanna go home  
"You can't win", you damn fool  
You drank all the wine from the cup  
And your painted lady's gone now  
And you're way back on the downside  
(Lookin' up)  
You can't catch the monkey on your back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But for every heart they held a spade  
And you lost more than money can buy  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own  
But I don't wanna go home  
I'm like a washed up rag, tattered and torn, yeah  
I wish I'd never been born  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own  
But I don't wanna go home  
I'm like a down and out just blowin' my horn  
Oh, I don't wanna go home  
I'm like a washed up rag, tattered and torn  
Oh, I don't wanna go home, yeah
