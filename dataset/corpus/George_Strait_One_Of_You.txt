Last night I had a dream, dreamt I had it all I had it all  
I had one truck, one car  
One boat, one guitar  
But all these things wouldn't get me too far  
If I didn't have one of you  
  
I work hard every day to bring home all my pay  
I got one house, one yard  
One dog who likes to bark  
We'd be cold, living the dark if I didn't have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
[Chorus]  
This is what I have, you have it all  
I got one heart, one love  
One dream I'm dreaming of  
Wouldn't have known what to give it all to  
If I didn't have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all I'll ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
[Chorus]
