Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made  
The doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the face  
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst  
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt  
'Cause I was raised an orphan  
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13  
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth  
Men just took me as they pleased  
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress  
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck  
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time  
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind  
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides  
But sometimes when you're riding free  
You'll pay the highest price  
On back roads and in back seats  
And in a cheap highway motel  
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light  
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night  
When I walked into the parlour here  
Other pieces seemed to fit  
I was good at pleasing strangers  
So I made the most of it  
  
Either way it's all a gamble  
So view the stakes and know the odds  
And lay your cards upon the table  
Do all the dealing from the top  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way
