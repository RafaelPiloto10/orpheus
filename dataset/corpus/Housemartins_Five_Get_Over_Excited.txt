Take, take, take

Fun, fun, fun  
James Dean posters on their wall  
(Five killed in the car-crash)  
What a sad little end to it all  
(Five killed in the car-crash)  
Last seen having lots of fun  
(Five dumped in a river)  
Barefoot and on the run  
(Five dumped in a river)  
I am mad from Scandinavia  
I want a guy in the London area  
He must be crazy and Sagittarius  
'Cause I'm Leo and I'm hilarious  
Fun, fun, fun

Me, me, me

Take, take, take

Fun, fun, fun  
Last seen drinking Daddy's own beer  
(Five poisoned over dinner)  
Singing Abba's, 'Mamma Mia'  
(Five poisoned over dinner)  
Drop dead watching Thunder birds fly  
(Five get over excited)  
Poster on their wall says, 'Why?'  
(Five get over excited)  
I am guy from Camden Town  
My hair is curly but I gel it down  
My clothes are black but my bread is brown  
I'm really into early Motown  
Fun, fun, fun

Fun, fun, fun  
Feigning concern, a conservative pastime  
Makes you feel doubtful right from the start  
The expression she pulls is exactly like last time  
You've got to conclude she just hasn't a heart
