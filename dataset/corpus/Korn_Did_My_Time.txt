Realize that I can never win  
Sometimes I feel like I have failed  
Inside where do I begin  
My mind is laughing at me  
  
Tell me why am I to blame on me  
Are we supposed to be the same, that's why  
I will never change this thing that's burning in me  
  
I am the one who chose my path  
I am the one who couldn't last  
I feel the life pulled from me  
I feel the anger changing me  
  
Sometimes I can never tell  
If I got something that remains  
That's why I just hang in grief  
Or this I just let me be  
  
Tell me why am I to blame on me  
Are we supposed to be the same, that's why  
I will never change this thing that's burning in me  
  
I am the one who chose my path  
I am the one who couldn't last  
I feel the life pulled from me  
I feel the anger changing me  
  
Betrayed,  
I feel so insane  
I really tried  
I did my time  
I did my time  
I did my time  
  
I did my time  
I did my time  
  
I am the one who chose my path  
I am the one who couldn't last  
I feel the life pulled from me  
I feel the anger changing me  
  
Oh god the anger changing me  
Oh god the anger changing me
