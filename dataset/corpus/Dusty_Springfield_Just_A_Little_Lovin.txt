Just a little lovin'  
Early in the mornin'  
Beats a cup of coffee  
For starting off the day  
  
Just a little lovin'  
When the world is yawnin'  
Makes you feel wake up feeling  
Good things are coming your way  
  
This old world  
Wouldn't be half as bad  
It wouldn't be half as sad  
If each and everybody in it had, yeah  
  
Just a little lovin'  
Early in the mornin'  
That little extra somethin'  
To kinda see them through  
  
Nothing turns the day on  
Really gets it dawnin'  
Like a little bit of lovin'  
From some lovin' someone like you  
  
This old world  
Wouldn't be half as bad  
It wouldn't be half as sad  
If each and everybody in it had  
  
Just a little lovin'  
Early in the mornin'  
(Just a little lovin')  
(When the world is yawnin')  
Just a little bit of lovin' ah  
Oh, in the morning  
Nothing turns the day on  
Really gets it dawnin'  
Make a little bit of lovin'  
It's so good, it's so good
