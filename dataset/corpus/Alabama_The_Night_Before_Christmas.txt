Ribbons and paper cover the floor, it's been a great Christmas with presents  
Galore  
Everyone's happy and I'm happy, too  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
  
Frost on the window, snow on the ground, holiday spirit, holiday sounds  
Everyone's thankful and I'm thankful, too  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
  
It all started underneath that mistletoe when we were waiting up just to help  
Ole Santa Claus  
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of when we heard those sleigh  
Bells and ole Santa almost caught us  
  
We didn't take no pictures, but I still remember one very special  
Twenty-fourth day of December  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
  
It all started underneath that mistletoe while we were waiting up to help ole  
Santa clause  
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of when we heard those sleigh  
Bells and ole Santa almost caught us  
  
If we don't do this next year, honey, I'm sure gonna miss it  
Why don't we make it a new yuletide tradition  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you
