I'll love you dear, as long as I live.  
  
It was easy said the night we parted  
That we'd forget we'd ever met  
I haven't forgotten, I wonder if you have  
Or if your heart is full of regret.  
  
As long as I live if it be one hour  
Or if it be one hundred years  
I'll keep remembering forever and ever  
I'll love you dear, as long as I live.  
  
Oh, I never thought that night we parted  
That life alone would be oh, so bad  
I know it sounds funny but I can't forget you  
You're the only joy that I've ever had.  
  
As long as I live if it be one hour  
Or if it be one hundred years  
I'll keep remembering forever and ever  
I'll love you dear, as long as I live.  
  
I'll love you dear, as long as I live
