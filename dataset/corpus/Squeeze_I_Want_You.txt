You took all you could  
And gave all you had  
Knowing that I would have to understand  
As you changed the locks  
And threw out my socks  
There was peace at hand  
You sat in my chair  
Your chin on your knees  
I'm no longer there  
And you look so pleased  
I don't think that I know what to say  
In my heart I love you anyway  
  
I want you today  
How can I score points  
And win back your trust  
Where our two hearts join  
There's a sign of rust  
From the tears you've cried  
With the times I've lied  
To the two of us  
I don't think that I know what to say  
In my heart I want you anyway  
  
I can see the road behind me as I walk  
I can feel the hurt that's burning as I talk  
  
I can see the kids  
As they play outside  
I can read their lips  
Their eyes open wide
