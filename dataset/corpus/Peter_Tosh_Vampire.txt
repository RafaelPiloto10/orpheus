Unnu old vampire  
You don't like to see youths prosper  
Only like to see youths suffer  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampire  
Only trod upon creation  
With your bloody meditation  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu fight against upfullness  
Unnu fight against creation  
Unnu fight against  
Everything good for the younger generation  
Unnu old vampire  
Do unnu wickedness at midnight  
And unnu humble when it's daylight  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampire  
Only like to see blood running  
But true you know it's fire bunnin'  
Unnu set of vampire  
Now unnu fight against upfullness  
Fight against creation  
Fight against everything good for the younger generation  
Unnu old vampire  
Only trod upon creation  
Sucking the blood of the nation  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampire  
Unnu drink up the old wine  
Have no place for the new mind  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu fight against morality  
You fight against integrity  
Fight against everything good for the younger generation  
Unnu old vampire  
Only trod upon creation  
With your bloody meditation  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampire  
Do unnu wickedness at midnight  
And unnu humble when it's daylight  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampires  
Unnu grieve their brnk? Lord  
Unnu fire burial  
Unnu hypocrite the world, God  
Unnu old vampire  
Do unnu wickedness every night  
And unnu humble when daylight  
Unnu old...
