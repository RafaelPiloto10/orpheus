This is not love  
This is not even worth a point of view  
In Echo Park I  
Pause for effect  
And whisper 'Who are you?'  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die : You die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die : You die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me, tear me, tear me  
  
But I have your names  
Screaming 'You will suffer'  
And, 'You're all too late'  
Now I feel young  
Does everything stop when the old tape fails?  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die, you die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die, you die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me, tear me, tear me  
  
But I'm still frightened by the telephone.
