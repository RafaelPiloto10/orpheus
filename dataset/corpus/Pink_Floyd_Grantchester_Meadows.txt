"Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain"  
In the sky a bird was heard to cry.  
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds  
Belie the deathly silence that lay all around.  
  
Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox  
Gone to ground.  
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.  
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees  
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer  
Making for the sea.  
  
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down.  
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground.  
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon  
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.  
  
Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox  
Gone to ground.  
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.  
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees.  
  
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down.  
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground.  
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon  
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.  
  
Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox  
Gone to ground.  
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.  
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees.
