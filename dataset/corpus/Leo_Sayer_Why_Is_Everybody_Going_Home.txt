And if you say again to me  
That we could all be free  
I'll have to leave  
Look at the sky  
It's falling down  
The world is spinning round  
Without a sound  
Where has all the lazy sunshine gone  
Can anybody tell me  
Why is everybody going home  
  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Oh have you stood  
Before the wind  
And let it blow your blues  
  
So far away  
Look at my life  
Oh, what's the use  
To everyone I know  
Oh I'm a fool  
Where have all the smiling faces gone  
Can anybody tell me  
Why is everybody going home  
  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me  
Can anybody tell me
