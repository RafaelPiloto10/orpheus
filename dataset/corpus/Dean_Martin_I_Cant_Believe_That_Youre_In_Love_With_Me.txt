Your eyes are blue your kisses too  
I never knew what they could do  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
You're telling everyone I know  
I'm on your mind each place you go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me  
I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe that you're in love  
Can't believe that you're in love  
Can't believe that you're in love with me
