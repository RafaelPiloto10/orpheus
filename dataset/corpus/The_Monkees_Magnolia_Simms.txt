Love to me is blue-eyed and blonde.  
Oh, that's sweet Magnolia.  
Apple pie on the window still warm.  
That's my sweet Magnolia  
  
Walking under a sky that's so blue  
After rain has fallen.  
When she's walking so close by my side  
My troubles seem to just run and hide.  
  
[la-dee, da-dumb, etc.]  
Well, walking under a sky that's so blue  
After rain has fallen.  
When she's walking so close by my side  
My troubles seem to just run and hide.  
  
Magnolia Simms is my little doll.  
I can't live without her.  
For if she goes my world will just fall.  
Stay with me, Magnolia.  
[Sound of record skipping]  
Stay with me, Magnolia.
