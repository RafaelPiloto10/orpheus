Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah  
  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah  
  
When he calls to me, I am ready  
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs  
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain  
Even after three times he betrays me  
Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down  
Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown  
  
I'm just a holy fool,  
Oh baby it's so cruel but  
I'm still in love with Judas baby  
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas baby  
  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah  
  
I couldn't love a man so purely  
Even darkness forgave his goofy way  
I've learned love is like a brick you can  
Build a house or sink a dead body  
  
Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down  
Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown  
  
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
  
In the most Biblical sense,  
I am beyond repentance  
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind  
But in the cultural sense  
I just speak in future tense  
Judas kiss me if offenced,  
Or wear an ear condom next time  
  
I wanna love you, but something's pulling me away from you  
Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to  
  
Just a holy fool, oh baby he's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah
