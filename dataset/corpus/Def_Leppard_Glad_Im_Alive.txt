Hello and welcome my friend  
It's good to see you again  
Do you know anything new  
Tell me is this really you  
Hey, what's the story in LA  
I haven't been there today  
It's time we went for a ride  
Come on and step right inside  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Darkness our sole destination  
Daylight our only intention  
White lightning brightens the sky  
Can't tell we're flying so high  
Rest now and don't be afraid  
Can't you see we've got it made  
Just cause I'm not going far  
That doesn't mean that we can't reach the stars  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Sad story that look in your eyes  
Break out before it's too late  
Now come and lay down by my side  
Let all the thoughts slip away  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
I'm alive  
Alive
