Hi, this is the big O, Otis Redding  
I was just standing here thinking about you  
Thought I'd write a song about you  
And dedicate it to you  
Take a listen  
  
If you didn't go back to school this year  
Your really not groovy  
Maybe you feel that school is a drag  
It's just don't moving  
But did you ever think about how square you look standing  
In an employment line because school didn't empty you  
  
You really ought to think about it  
Without an education you could only be a tramp  
Grow 'grain' shoes, no haircut, just plain ole country  
Don't worry 'bout the fellows gonna calling you green  
Because your heading no future condition  
  
You really ought to think about it  
And further motto than that Otis Redding saved you very wise  
Because you'll be at the top  
  
When they get that and if they make it  
When they get that and if they make it  
When they get that and if they make it  
  
You really ought to think about it  
Think about it  
Really ought to think about it
