When a bee lies sleepin'  
In the palm of your hand  
You're bewitched and deep in love's  
Long looked after land  
  
Where you'll see a sun up in sky  
With the mornin' dew  
And where the days go laughin' by  
As love comes callin' on you  
  
Sleep on bee, don't 'waken  
Can't believe what just passed  
He's mine for the taken  
I am happy at last  
  
Maybe I dreams but he seems  
Sweet golden as a crown  
A sleepin' bee done told me  
I will walk with my feet off the ground  
  
When my one true love  
I has found  
  
Sleep on bee, don't 'waken  
Can not believe what just passed  
He's mine for the taken  
I am happy at last  
  
Maybe I dreams but he seems  
Golden as a crown  
A sleepin' bee told me  
I will walk with my feet off the ground  
  
When my one true love  
I has found
