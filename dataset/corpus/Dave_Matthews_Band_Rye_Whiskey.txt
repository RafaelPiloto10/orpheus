Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey I cryyyyyy-  
If I don?t get Rye Whiskey, I surely will die-  
If the ocean was Whiskey and I was a duck,  
I?d swim to the bottom and never come up-  
I?d swim to the bottom and never come up-  
  
Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey I cryyyyy  
If I don?t get Rye Whiskey, I surely will die!  
  
I live on Clintch Mountain and Wander Alone,  
As drunk as the Devil, so leave me alone  
I?m as drunk as the Devil, so leave me alone-  
  
Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey I cryyyyy  
If I don?t get Rye Whiskey I surely will die!  
  
I eat when I?m hungry and I drink when I?m dry and if that tree don?t fall on
me-  
I live til? I die!  
If a tree don?t fall on me, I live til I die-  
Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey, Rye Whiskey I cryyyy  
If I don?t get Rye Whiskey I surely will die  
If I don?t get Rye Whiskey??..  
I surely will die.
