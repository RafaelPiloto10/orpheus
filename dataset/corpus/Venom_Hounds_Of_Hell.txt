Summoning the Hounds of Hell  
To do my deadly deeds  
In the magic pentagram  
I plant satanic seeds  
Summing forth the elements  
Lightning, thunder and rain  
Mortals fear this ritual  
They think it is a game  
  
Laughing, crying  
Never dying  
Feel the Earth's core bleed  
Synchronizing, perfect timing  
Watch the Heavens scream  
  
For the Hounds of Hell  
  
From inside the pentagram  
I see the signs of life  
Up from Hell my babies come  
With eternal life  
Summoning infernal bloodlust  
I set the demons free  
Go unto this world  
And destroy everything you see  
  
Laughing, crying  
Never dying  
Feel the Earth's core bleed  
Synchronizing, perfect timing  
Watch the Heavens scream  
  
For the Hounds of Hell
