What's love got to do, go to do with it  
I get a little taste then I'm through with it  
Then I send it right back to you with it  
  
(How high)  
  
What's love got to do, go to do with it  
I get a little taste then I'm through with it  
Then I send it right back to you with it  
  
[Verse 1: J. Cole]  
Visionary play your position, no missionary  
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke  
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope  
Now picture that  
My poetry's deep now fish for that  
Only real n-ggas catch something, phoney n-ggas fail  
Sh-t you gotta feel like it's only read in braille  
Both did the crime but his homie didn't tell  
So he f-cking b-tches while he sitting lonely in a cell  
Thinking well, what the hell I been on  
They gave a n-gga five then they threw another ten on  
By the time I'm back on the streets like a bachelor  
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman  
Life is a movie, pick your own role  
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole  
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying  
You wanna touch the sky b-tch you figure out flying  
  
[Chorus:]  
N-gga how high, so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' b-tch  
N-gga please, my squad stack plenty of G's  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
N-gga how high, so high that I could touch the sky  
How sick, so sick that I could f-ck yo' b-tch  
N-gga please, my squad stack plenty of G's  
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees  
  
[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl  
My n-ggas hit the trees like squirrels  
Tryna get a nut with your girl  
Think I need to quit trying 'fore some n-gga out there try to hit mine  
Karma for the karma sutra  
A lot calmer when the ganja's through ya  
You need ya armour cause them n-ggas out here tryna shoot ya  
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda  
For stashing that marijuana  
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed  
I broke the law but look I'll never smoke or steal again  
In your courtroom wylin' out, I don't mean to keep smiling  
But right now I'm high enough to probably steal a plane  
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn't read?  
Would you throw the book at me  
What if I'm feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy  
It's been a long time coming  
Tell my n-gga roll me up something  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole:]  
No I don't smoke, maybe once in a blue  
When the tention gets thick than there's nothing to do  
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind  
My eyes get shut but I open my mind  
  
How high, la la la la  
How high, hey hey hey  
How high, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
How high, la la la la  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
Is that a shot that you threw little man?  
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned  
Make it worse, you're friends, now when they talk rap  
All you hear is "J Cole this" and "J Cole that"  
It must be hard for your projects to take all that  
I know your weak heart gotta break off that  
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear  
I'm burning you n-ggas and I'm only in first gear  
I'm serving you n-ggas this is only the first beer  
12 months from now, you'll be having the worst year  
No tears for the haters, I'm still counting money  
Cole ain't dropping, that's real f-cking funny  
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a n-gga raps  
Something like a mummy  
But I'm a wake yo' ass up  
Something like your mommy on school day  
I smoke two l's with ya girl this is Cool J  
  
How high  
How high  
How high, yeah  
How high, yeah  
  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
I get a little taste then I'm through with it  
Yeah I send it right back to you with it
