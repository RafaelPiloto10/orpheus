Maybe she was smilin' in the mirror  
Maybe I was too, 'cause I was stoned  
Singin' every sad song on the juke-box one more time  
Honey, they were hittin' close to home  
  
And I said - Maybe this'll make you think I'm crazy  
Honey, don't feel lonesome if you do  
But if you wanna make a young man happy one more time  
I'd sure like to spend the night with you  
  
And she said - Stranger  
Shut out the light and lead me  
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too  
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me  
Stranger, could I believe in you  
  
Maybe you got all you got together  
Maybe you keep rollin' like a stone  
Maybe some old lonesome song'll take you by surprise  
And leave you just a little more alone  
  
Singing - Stranger  
Shut out the light and lead me  
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too  
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me  
Stranger, could I believe in you  
  
Keep Singing - Stranger  
Shut out the light and lead me  
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too  
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me  
Stranger, could I believe in you
