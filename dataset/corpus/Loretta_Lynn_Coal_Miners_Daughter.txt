Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter,  
In a cabin, on a hill in butcher holler.  
We were poor but we had love,  
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,  
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.  
  
My daddy worked all night in the Van ]Lear coal mines.  
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.  
Mommy rocked the babies at night,  
And read the bible by the coal oil light,  
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.  
  
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.  
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed,  
To complain, there was no need,  
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.  
  
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.  
But in the wintertime we all got a brand new pair.  
From a mail order catalog  
Money made from selling a hog,  
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.  
  
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,  
I remember well, the well where I drew water.  
The work we done was hard,  
At night we'd sleep cause we were tired  
I never thought of ever leaving butcher holler.  
  
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then  
And it feels so good to be back home again.  
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore,  
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter
