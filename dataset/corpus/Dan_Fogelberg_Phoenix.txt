I have cried too  
I have cried too long  
I have cried too  
I have cried too long  
No more sorrow,  
Got to carry on  
  
Found deep water  
Before I've even learned to swim  
Found deep water  
Before I've even learned to swim  
Never thought I'd  
See the sun again  
  
Once I was a  
Once I was a man alone  
Once I was a  
Once I was a man alone  
Now I've found a  
Heart to call my home  
  
Like a Phoenix,  
I have risen from the flames  
Like a Phoenix,  
I have risen from the flames  
No more living  
Someone else's dreams  
  
I have cried too  
I have cried too long  
I have cried too  
I have cried too long  
No more sorrow  
Got to carry on  
  
You almost had me, old lady  
You almost tied me down good  
You played the lady in waiting  
And I waited as long as I could  
  
Too long the songs have been silent  
Too long the strings have been still  
I never knew what you wanted  
An I guess that I Never Will  
  
Like a phoenix,  
I have risen from the flames  
Like a phoenix,  
I have risen from the flames  
No more living  
Someone else's dreams  
  
I have cried too  
I have cried too long  
I have cried too  
I have cried too long  
No more sorrow  
Got to carry on
