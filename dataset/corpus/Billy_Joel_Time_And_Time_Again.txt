[Incomprehensible] is flowing  
Through these phantom eyes  
They're starting it good  
  
It's all I dream, we're the same  
But then you refused  
I thought you could  
  
Time and time again  
I cursed the day you left me  
  
But now don't expect me  
'Cause all I've left is sorrow  
I shouldn't wash out all tomorrows  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
You thought you was superior  
I thought now you see that I'm a perfume  
  
Then I'm the only one  
Who could ever love you  
I know it sure looks so pure  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Would you plan to [Incomprehensible]  
This love with an instant linger  
  
I still can feel the touch, loving single  
Of your hand, of my mind  
Of your hand, of your mind, yeah
