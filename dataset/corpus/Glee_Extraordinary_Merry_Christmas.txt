It came into my dreams last night  
A great, big man in red and white.  
He told me that it's gonna be  
A special year for you and me.  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Hold me tight and kiss me slow.  
The snow is high so come inside  
I wanna hear you say to me!  
  
It's a very, very, merry, merry Christmas.  
Gonna party on 'til Santa grants my wishes.  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
It's who I'm with.  
It's an extraordinary merry Christmas!  
  
It doesn't come as a surprise  
Who's been naughty, who's been nice.  
There's someone here for everyone  
Another year has just begun.  
Silent night, not inside  
Sleigh bells ring until the light  
Hearts explode, here we go  
It's all like they're inside your eyes!  
  
It's a very, very, merry, merry Christmas.  
Gonna party on 'til Santa grants my wishes.  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
It's who I'm with.  
It's an extraordinary merry Christmas!  
  
Won't you meet me by the tree?  
Slip away so secretly.  
Can't you see how this could be?  
The greatest gift of all!  
It's a very, very, merry, merry Christmas.  
Gonna stay with you 'til Santa grants my wishes.  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
It's who I'm with.  
It's an extraordinary merry very, very, merry, merry Christmas!  
Gonna party on 'til Santa grants my wishes.  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
It's who I'm with.  
It's an extraordinary merry Christmas!  
  
It's a very, very, merry, merry Christmas.  
It's an extraordinary merry Christmas!
