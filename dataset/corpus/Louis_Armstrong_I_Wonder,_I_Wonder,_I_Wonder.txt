All by myself alone at home a feeling blue  
Thoughts keep roaming through my mind, they're all of you  
I wonder if you're dancing, with somebody new  
I wonder, I wonder can't help it if I wonder  
No matter which side of the pillow that I'm sleeping on  
My dreams of you continue through until the dawn  
And after that I find the day dream crew comes on  
I wonder, I wonder, can't help it if I wonder  
You care for someone else, I see  
Well, then it's quite alright with me  
I'm gonna get me dressed up in my Sunday suit  
And find myself somebody who is twice as cute  
And when you realize that you and I are through  
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what you'll do
