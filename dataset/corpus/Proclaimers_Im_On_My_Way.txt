I'm on my way from misery to happiness today  
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today  
I'm on my way to what I want from this world  
And years from now you'll make it to the next world  
And everything that you receive up yonder  
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered  
  
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday  
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday  
I took the road that brought me to your home town  
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down  
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for  
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door  
  
[Chorus]  
And now that I don't want for anything  
I'd have Al Jolson sing "I"m sitting on top of the world."  
  
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can  
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can  
To keep my feet from jumping from the ground dear  
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth dear  
To keep the past, the past and not the present  
To try and learn when you teach me a lesson  
  
[Chorus]
