We are, friends for life.  
Hold that, deep inside  
Let this, be a drive  
To survive  
  
And just stand, high and tall  
Make sure you give your all  
And if you ever fall  
Know that I'm right here  
  
We'll always be together, don't you worry  
I'll always be by your side, don't you worry  
The circle will never end, just know that we'll meet again  
And we'll always be together, forever, always  
  
I am here, find me, in the sky  
Destine with the moon at night  
Your heartbeat is disguised as my, lullaby  
Be happy, and know that I'm  
Watching you travel far and wide  
Waiting for us to meet again  
  
We'll always be together, don't you worry  
I'll always be by your side, don't you worry  
The circle will never end, just know that we'll meet again  
And we'll always be together, forever, always  
  
I am here, If you need me, yeah  
I'm in the wind , look for me friend  
I'm in the stars, when you need me  
The heavens will send a message within  
Straight to your heart, ooh  
  
We'll always be together, don't you worry, don't you worry  
I'll always be by your side, don't you worry  
The circle will never end, just know that we'll meet again  
And we'll always be together, forever, always.  
I am here, I am here, I am here
