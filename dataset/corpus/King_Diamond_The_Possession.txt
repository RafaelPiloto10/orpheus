On the very next morning  
When the mist was eaten away by the sun  
Miriam grew hour by hour and  
Jonathan he cried  
He knew the ghost had been telling the truth  
So this was 9  
The pregnancy would not last overnight  
  
Oh she started singing  
A lullaby, rocking the cradle again  
And then she said  
I'm having your baby my love, love  
But it wasn't love, oh no  
She was possessed, and he knew  
  
I will get what is rightfully mine  
  
Speaking with different tongues  
Miriam was eaten alive from inside  
Again she said  
I'm having your baby my love, love  
But it wasn't love, oh no  
She was possessed, possessed
