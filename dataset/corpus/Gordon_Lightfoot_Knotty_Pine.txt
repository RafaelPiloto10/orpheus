She's my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She cries turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I don't mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow  
She's knotty but nice  
Reaching for the sky  
She don't like snow 'n ice  
To leave things as they stand  
Is my advice  
She's been good to me  
So I tend to go there when I can  
She's my knotty pine  
Such a pretty scene  
She tries to be kind  
She gives birds a home  
And shelters them  
In her coat of green  
She's as green as evergreen can be  
She's a real delight  
When little breezes call  
To ruffle up her skin  
All her sap runs free  
And sticks to me  
Hidden deep within  
I will be her slave eternally  
She's my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She crys turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I don't mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow
