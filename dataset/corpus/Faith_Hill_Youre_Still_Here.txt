Thought I saw you today  
You were standing in the sun then you turned away  
And I knew it couldn't be  
But my heart believed  
  
Oh, it seems like there's something everyday  
How could you be so far away  
  
When you're still here  
When I need you, you're not hard to find  
You're still here  
  
I can see you in my baby's eyes  
And I laugh and cry  
You're still here  
  
I had a dream last night  
That you came to me on silver wings  
And I flew away with you on a painted sky  
And I woke up wondering  
What was real  
Is it what you see and touch  
Or what you feel  
  
'Cause you're still here  
Oh, you're everywhere we've ever been  
You're still here  
  
I heard you in a stranger's laugh  
And I hung around to hear him laugh again  
Just once again  
  
Thought I saw you today  
You were standing in the sun then you turned away  
  
Away
