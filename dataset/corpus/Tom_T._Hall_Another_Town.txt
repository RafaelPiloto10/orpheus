Loving you was just a storybook of fair I've decided there ain't no real life
anywhere  
Soon I'll be a painted picture in the book of your mind  
Another town is somewhere down the line  
Another town another grocery store another town another set of swinging doors  
And somehow I'm a little bit suspicious in my mind  
It's another town that don't need my kind  
Tell your mama she was sure a dandy cook tell your papa that I understood his
looks  
If I put it all together you're a piece that wouldn't fit  
There's another town a comin' up I guess  
Another town another grocery store...  
As I leave you let me leave you with this thought  
Time is candy and we ate all that we bought  
And teardrops they're just wrappers on the ground  
That a new wind blows into another town  
Another town another grocery store..  
Another town another grocery store...
