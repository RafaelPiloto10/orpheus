Empty words, falling on ears  
Which have never heard  
Hollow lies, comin' from  
Lost, hung-up and lonely guys  
Through the night, make a sight  
Other rider looks so true  
Sinnin', spinnin' tales of Lucy Blue  
  
Piercing smile filling her face  
For a while  
Closin' door, leaving the heart open  
And wounded more  
Gone away, lonely day  
Turning grey with no clue  
Faking, making tales of Lucy Blue  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Restless night, longing for love  
Beneath the neon light  
Desperate hands reachin' for someone  
Who'll understand  
Stroll around through the town  
Lost and found when it's due  
Sellin', tellin' tales of Lucy Blue  
  
Yeah Lucy Blue, one or two  
Just for you, hey yeah  
Tales of Lucy Blue
