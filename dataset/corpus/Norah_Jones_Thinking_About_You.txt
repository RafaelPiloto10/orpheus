Yesterday I saw the sun shinin'  
And the leaves were fallin' down softly  
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch  
And I was thinkin' about you  
  
But here I am lookin' for signs of leaving  
You hold my hand, but do you really need me?  
I guess it's time for me to let you go  
And I'll be thinkin' about you  
  
I'll be thinkin' about you  
  
When you sail across the ocean waters  
And you reach the other side safely  
Could you smile a little smile for me?  
'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you  
I'll be thinkin' about you  
I'll be thinkin' about you  
I'll be thinkin' about you  
I'll be thinkin' about you
