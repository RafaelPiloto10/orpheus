There's love in the corners  
and love down the straight highway  
there's danger in the outskirts of town  
and in what you don't say  
you're either sinking or thinking  
the dark's your romance  
or a special one's shining a light on a chance  
that it's all very worthy to ache  
in the middle of the night  
  
Sometimes I can't sleep  
I can't keep all these feelings at bay  
I am rage, I am sorrow and grief  
all alone in my way  
I know humor and heartbreak  
and people are life  
if I keep my eyes closed  
i'll be open to strife  
because the powers that be send their love  
in the middle of the night  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.  
  
To my mother my father  
my witnesses live in my jagged heart  
that for years has been running like fire  
as though that was its part  
from lover to cover and ocean to sky  
from desert to mountain and promise to lie  
I can say that I've prayed to forgiveness  
in the middle of the night  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.  
  
Now I can see love in the woman  
And love in the man in myself  
I see how most people just ache to be good  
at expressing themselves  
and I wish I could tell you just right what I mean  
about the light shining down, if I'd only come clean  
but for now I live with myself  
in the middle of the night.  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.
