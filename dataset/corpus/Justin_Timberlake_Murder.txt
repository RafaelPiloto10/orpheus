Walking around middle of the night  
My enemies like with that innocent face  
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next to it  
It's murder, murder  
You say I need to watch out something might go down  
Good I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground  
And I'll be down and throw it at that level  
And even when you speak regular it's freaky girl, I say OK  
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better  
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to  
The bed's way under the ground, under the ground  
And I'll be down and throw it at that level  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder  
  
You dancing around, hanging out the window  
Talking real big with your little slim waist  
And with all that below your waist  
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder  
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down  
Girl, your body is gonna end up  
Under the ground, under the ground  
I'll be down and throw it at that level  
And even when you dress regular a freak chic  
Girl, you complement my taste  
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better, better  
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to  
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground  
And I'll be down to go to that level  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Ooh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder  
  
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono  
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo  
Know that shit gotta be lethal  
If that pussy broke up The Beatles  
Told yah, ruined pop culture  
All them playa days is over  
Got me buying Rovers, rings  
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kabooms  
That bomb, that P  
It's a problem call the police  
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast  
Faces of death, she fine or what  
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up  
Give new meaning to dying to fuck, she's  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder
