If you've got to be told by someone then  
Its got to be me  
And that's not made from cheese and he doesn't  
Get you free  
So now your wising up to know you need a job  
Don't bite, don't bite, don't bite out in here  
Its been nice wasting time its not worth your while  
Blow on go on blow on go up and spill it all out  
And if we have to be shown by someone then it wont be you  
You see that Jesus is a cunt  
And never helped you with a thing that you do, or you done,  
It wont be long, it wont be long to get rid of your furry  
Tongue  
  
Its going in out, its going in out  
  
Blow on go on blow on go on and stroke a left side  
Go on blow on go on blow on and stroke a right side  
  
Your biting into the root your smoking pot to the wall  
Blow on go on blow on go on and take it full blown  
  
Kuff dam, down down dam kuff  
Kuff dam, dam kuff
