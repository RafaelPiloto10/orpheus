Movin' light, dream machinery  
Crashin' in, through my balcony - oh no  
I shout down the line but could not get through  
Cause the telephone never rings when you want it to  
  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
  
Words of love take your breath away  
Just a game that you like to play - oh no  
Sleepwalking through a world of pain  
Just another pretty face, in the romeo rain  
  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned  
Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
  
Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
You know your paint by number life does not excite you  
It's a watercolor world that you're livin' in  
And when you close your eyes at night  
You're wonderin', just where you've been  
  
You were young when you heard the call  
Saw it all in your crystal ball and chains  
A problem child who can pick and choose  
When the sandman calls your name, you cannot refuse  
  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland - Ooh  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned  
Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
In Dreamland  
In Dreamland
