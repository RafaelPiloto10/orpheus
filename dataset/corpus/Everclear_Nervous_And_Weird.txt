You know I want to be the way you want me to  
Big hearted and tall enough to cover you  
I would break in half if you said it out loud  
Splinter out of myself just like mercury  
I think it's better now than how it used to be  
You were lying in bed and I would levitate  
I think it's better here than where we used to be  
I wish I could go out into the Oregon sun to be alive in the day  
I would smile at everyone  
  
I remember you back in '83 you were dressing insane  
You were my everything you were so different from all those other  
girls  
  
A blind Electra in drag so cool and casually lame  
I think I'm better now than how I used to be  
Always nervous and weird, scared most of the time  
I think it's better now than how it used to be  
Always up in the night afraid to live in the day  
  
Afraid of being afraid  
Afraid to live in the day  
Afraid of being afraid  
  
Now I sit alone when you're not around  
I read aloud just to hear a friendly voice  
I see you scary dolls they always look at me  
From the corner of my eyes I see them shake their heads  
  
You know I want to be the way you me to  
Big hearted and tall enough to cover you  
You know I want to be the way you me to  
I wish I could go out just to be alive in the day  
To be alive in the day
