Traveling with the rodeo  
It's the only life I'll ever know  
I started in New Mexico  
Must have been a thousand years ago  
I used to be the best they say  
At riding young wild horses for my pay  
But now I'm much too old it seems  
I only rides wild horses in his dreams  
  
They use to tell me, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down  
You can't make no money if you hit the ground  
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down  
You're the toughest cowboy in town  
  
I have always been a traveling cowboy  
But now there's no place left to go  
What in I supposed to do  
Seems I'm left out in the cold  
  
Ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down  
You can't make no money if you hit the ground  
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down  
You're the toughest cowboy in town  
  
Oh midnight was the champion  
He is the only bronc I couldn't ride  
But now I hear old Midnights blind  
And rides little children for a dime  
Ladies used to hang around  
I must have been a hero in their eyes  
My silver spurs are rusted now  
Lord, I wished I tried to settle down  
  
They use to tell me, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down  
You can't make no money if you hit the ground  
They say, ride 'em cowboy don't let 'em throw you down  
You're the toughest cowboy in town  
  
Traveling with the rodeo  
It's the only life I'll ever know
