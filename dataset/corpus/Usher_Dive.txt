I know you think I'm afraid  
To take a chance, go to the deep end  
Usher baby  
Turn the lights on  
  
These waters can get a little busy  
But I got experience  
Don't mind trekking through the storm  
Long as I know that you're here with me baby  
Shedding all your innocence  
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate  
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways  
But I promise girl I ain't afraid  
  
It's raining inside your bed  
No parts are dry  
Loving made you so wet, your legs, your thighs  
And ever since we first met I knew that  
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive  
  
Can't help it, no  
I want you to feel me  
Every little bit of me baby  
I don't need a life saver  
Baby going deeper ain't gon' kill me  
And I know the rest you'll get from me  
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate  
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways  
But I promise girl I ain't afraid  
  
It's raining inside your bed  
No parts are dry  
Loving made you so wet, your legs, your thighs  
And ever since we first met I knew that  
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive  
  
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby  
You'll be my place to hide all night, all night babe  
I'm not afraid to try  
And no I don't mind playing in the rain  
And I was hoping that I'd get to take that dive  
  
It's raining inside your bed  
No parts are dry  
Loving made you so wet, your legs, your thighs  
And ever since we first met I knew that  
I knew I was ready baby to take that dive
