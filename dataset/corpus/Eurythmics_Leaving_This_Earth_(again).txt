She takes a shower in a small town  
Near Birmingham  
Though here clothes are  
Unfashionable  
They have a timeless feel  
Is she real?  
  
She leaves the building  
And walks through  
The housing estate  
It's 7.30  
A state grey sky  
But in spite of this  
She turns and blows a kiss  
  
She's leaving this earth again  
There's a shuttle bound for take off  
11.45 a.m. she'll be there  
She's special  
Oh so special  
Knows enough about science  
To get married to a millionaire  
She'll be there  
  
He'll comb his hair  
In a high rise apartment  
On the river Tyne  
Though his neck is scarred  
He has a strong and handsome face  
A human face  
He leaves the building  
And walks to his electric car  
It's 7.30 there's a bitter wind  
But in spite of that  
He turns and tips his hat  
  
He's leaving this earth again  
There's a shuttle bound for take off  
11.45 a.m.  
  
He'll be there  
He's so special oh so special  
Knows enough about science  
To forget about his morning prayers  
He'll be there  
  
I'm leaving this earth again  
There's a shuttle bound for take off  
11.45 a.m. I'll be there  
I'm special oh so special  
I was chosen by the captain  
Of a spaceship in Trafalgar Square  
And I promised I'd be there or be square!
