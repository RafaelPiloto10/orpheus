I'm putting you right out of my life  
Ain't going to see you for quite some time  
I'm fading away in the morning sun  
Maybe behind it I'll find someone  
Baby, why do you sneak into my mind?  
Why do you haunt me all the time?  
Why don't you go and leave me be?  
Why don't you go and leave me free?  
This time, stop me if you think you can  
Oh, we had a love that lived and died  
When it was over there was no one to cry  
So now that it's gone without one tear  
Reckon it's time that I was not here  
Been flitting around your scene too long  
Reckon it's time I was travelling on  
Oh baby, if you don't want me to go  
Why are you whispering my name so low
