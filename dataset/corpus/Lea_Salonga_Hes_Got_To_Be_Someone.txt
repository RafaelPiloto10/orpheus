You don't know him  
Like I know him  
He must be allowed to stand proud  
If you shame this man and make him crawl  
He'd be no man at all, no man at all  
  
He's got to be someone  
Who wakes every morning  
And takes on the world for a limb  
Who touches your hand and makes you fall for only him  
  
And he's got to be someone  
Who's strong as a lion yet sweet as a meadowlark's song  
Who makes any dream seem like you'd love to go along  
  
Oh, everything about him is a contradiction  
Built a boundless empire with the heart of a child  
I'd trade it all if I could just recall  
The last time the Emperor smiled  
  
And he's got to be someone  
Who burns with a passion that never ever sets him free  
Oh, please say tonight might relieve him of his misery  
And bring back the someone I knew to me...
