Green are your eyes  
In the morning when you rise.  
Don't you be afraid, my love,  
To lie by me,  
Your father will not know.  
Love can be broken  
Though no words are spoken.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me my love,  
Your father will not know.  
Love, don't cry  
I'll not try.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love,  
Your father will not know.  
Yes love, don't you cry,  
I'll not try.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love.  
Your father will be told someday  
About our wedding day.
