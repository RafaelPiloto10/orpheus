We're given a garden  
And gave back a parking lot  
We got about fifteen minutes to go  
Before this audience  
Starts throwing tomatoes, yeah  
It?s not the end, there is more show  
We got about fifteen minutes to go  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God, will we survive ourselves?  
I'm not an alarmist  
But someone should break the glass  
And pull that red T-lever down  
To get their attention  
Start lobbing the light grenades  
That burst and blind them with the truth  
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God, will we survive ourselves?  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked out heads above the mud  
Wipe off your face, we've come this far  
Come on, remember who you are  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked our heads above the mud  
No one?s immune, deafening bells  
My God  
Survived the plague, floated the flood  
Just peeked out heads above the mud  
Wipe off your face, we've come this far  
Come on, remember who you are  
Come on, remember who you are  
Come on, remember who you are  
Remember, remember  
Come on, remember who you are  
Remember, remember  
Come on, remember who you are
