What would I do?  
Lonely as you  
Pleasure or pain I can choose  
What would I do?  
Lonely as you  
  
Pleasure or pain I can choose  
  
Wake up your dream and I can't stand your screamin'  
Drowning out these prayers just some words without meanin'  
Spare all the preachin' my secret's worth keepin'  
No one understands like I do  
  
Keep out of reach I'm your leadin' deletion  
Hide behind these masks  
Though they still see right through them  
Every now and then  
You're down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
Blame it on you thought these years I've been losin'  
Blame it on the past it's the last place I knew you  
Blame all the children their rage and their ruin  
Blame it on the black and the blue  
Every now and then  
You're down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
I'm down with you  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
Every now and then  
You're down and out my friend  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
Down and out again  
But I'm done with you  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
  
One more time for the last time  
One more time for release  
One more time for the very last time  
Everyone wants to believe  
All Right!
