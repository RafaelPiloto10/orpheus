If they want to blow up the French, king of Italy  
Co-prince of Andorra  
You guessed it  
It's me  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Ugh!  
  
Hello Paris, I bust through the door  
Now everybody lift your jaws off the floor  
You act like you've never seen your emperor before  
It's Napoleon and I'm back for more  
  
I've just escaped from exile on Elba  
Where they call me the cage monster  
They say I'm short and I got little hands  
But check out my massive... battle plans  
  
Yes we've got to go to war one more time  
Against who? Everybody but don't worry we'll be fine  
Just fighting to get back what's rightfully mine  
Which is everything I conquered the first time  
  
King Louis whatever  
He aint got nothing on me  
The greatest Frenchman ever  
Come to war with me  
French people my subjects  
I brought you success  
Women used to make me nervous  
But in battle I'm the best  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
I didn't come to party  
I came to get nasty  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
Just got to win at Waterloo  
Then I'll get back to ruling you  
  
You say I'm cocky  
Maybe I am  
It's not my fault  
It's my pituitary gland or maybe my ego  
But I'll tell you what is true  
I'm a military genius  
And my army love me too  
  
I can barely ride a horse  
But not for want of trying  
I'd say it's not my sore  
But I would be lying  
It's the British and the Dutch and the Prussian army  
But that's okay  
The Prussian leader's barmy  
  
I'm pregnant with an elephant  
  
See what I mean?  
But I really need to win before they get on the scene  
Can't pray for rain to stop  
Don't believe in God  
If it carries on much longer we'll be stuck in the mud  
  
I got 100 days  
And I'm back up in this  
We're out numbered, yes  
But we can win this  
  
Sure I'm a little fat  
And it hurts when I pee  
But don't worry about that  
I'll lead you to victory... baby  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
Look out world, wait and see  
You're about to see the best of me  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
Just got to beat Wellington  
Which almost nobody has done  
  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
Napoleon Bonaparte  
  
And I'll go down in history  
Cos Waterloo's my destiny
