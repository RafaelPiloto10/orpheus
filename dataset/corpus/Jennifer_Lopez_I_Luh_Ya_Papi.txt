I put it down for a brother like you  
Give it to you right in the car, that's you  
We can first give you some of this, that's you  
And you're all that loving that J. Lo, true  
  
Hold up, I can get your funnel  
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun off  
Gonna tie my hair up top  
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock  
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics  
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static  
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs  
No brakes, go green, no red  
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head  
Put it on you, I'm a need about 4-5 beds  
Cause I love my papi  
  
I didn't see it  
But I see it now

All day, 24 hour  
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded  
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it  
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower  
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it  
You can drop it how you want, I ain't trying to count mileage  
I'm loving me some you  
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof  
Cause I love my papi

Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami  
Shorty got me catching feelings  
And that rave drop reaching for the ceiling  
Southside Bronx, Teterboro, just overseas  
Take the pants out here, drop to her knees  
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar  
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, throw my  
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players  
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us  
From the bottom it been real  
From the bottom shorty been trill  
And even though we made it to the top  
Still J. Lo from the-the the block  
Ey, I love you, mami, I love you, mami  
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami  
  
I think I love just who you are  
We haven't grown apart  
This is just the start.  
Where life begins, all the way to the end  
And we started as friends, boy I do love  
  
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
