I realize that now our love is past  
Tried so hard to make it last  
Feelings are far gone  
They seem to fade away  
But yet I can hear him say  
We did try, tried our best  
To make it through those times  
Let's stop, don't go any further  
'Cause I need some time  
  
Darlin' I know you never meant to make me cry  
I never understood your reasons why  
And darlin' I know you never meant to make me cry  
These lonely nights without you  
I guess it's goodbye  
  
And I never thought that I would hear you say  
I should go on my own way  
Tell me, can't you see the changes  
That you put me through  
I wonder if you really knew  
How much I tried my best to make it  
Through those times  
But you said stop, don't go any further  
'Cause I need more time  
Oh, baby and  
  
Darlin' I know you never meant to make me cry  
I never understood your reasons why  
And darlin' I know you never meant to make me cry  
These lonely nights without you  
I guess it's goodbye (Goodbye)  
  
Darlin' I know you never meant to make me cry  
I never understood your reasons why  
And darlin' I know you never meant to make me cry  
These lonely nights without you  
I guess it's goodbye (Goodbye)
