You hold me in your eyes  
In your own special way  
I wonder how you know  
The things I never say  
  
I can't imagine life  
Without you by my side  
The power of your love  
Is all I need tonight  
  
I know there have been times  
That I have caused you pain  
I'd turn them all around  
If I could start again  
  
There's something I must say  
I know it's overdue  
The sweetest thing I've known  
Forever called my own  
  
Begins and ends with you  
How I love you  
How I love you  
The softness of your lips  
  
The color of your hair  
The memory of your touch  
Remains when you're not there  
The echoes of your laughter  
  
When I'm feeling blue  
The meaning of my life  
It all begins with you  
So come into my arms  
  
Lay down by my side  
The moon is always there  
To keep our love alight  
I've reached so very high  
  
For everything that's mine  
And at the top is you  
I want you for all time  
A dream forever new  
  
How I love you  
How I love you  
The softness of your lips  
The color of your hair  
  
The memory of your touch  
Remains when you're not there  
The echoes of your laughter  
When I'm feeling blue  
  
The meaning of my life  
It all begins with you  
So come into my arms  
Lay down by my side  
  
The moon is always there  
To keep our love alight  
You know me like a book  
You've read a thousand times  
  
We know each other's hearts  
We read each other's mind  
This feeling's always new  
  
How I love you  
How I love you  
The softness of your lips  
The color of your hair  
  
The memory of your touch  
Remains when you're not there  
The echoes of your laughter  
When I'm feeling blue  
  
The meaning of my life  
It all begins with you
