Wake up, The house is on fire  
And the cat's caught in the dryer  
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone  
"Icon" is the last chance for hope  
When there's no such thing as heroes  
Your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in  
  
Last chance to piss it all away  
Nothing but hell to pay  
When the lights are going down  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone  
  
Christmas lights in the middle of August  
Grudges come back to haunt us  
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies  
Grounded in a duplex to find that you're living on a landmine  
Vacation hot spots is a cemetery drive  
  
Last chance to piss it all away  
Nothing but hell to pay  
When the lights are going down  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone  
  
Last chance to piss it all away  
Nothing but hell to pay when all you want to do is not give up  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone
