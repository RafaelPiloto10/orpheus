Miss Molly had a steam boat,  
The steam boat had a bell,  
Miss Molly went to heaven,  
The steam boat went to hell-o operator,  
Please give me number 9,  
And if you disconnect me,  
I'll kick you in the behind the yellow curtain,  
There Was a piece of glass,  
Miss Molly sat upon it,  
And hurt her big fat ass-k,  
Me no more questions,  
Tell me no more lies,  
The boys are in the washroom,  
Doing up their fly-ies  
Are in the city,  
Bees are in the park,  
Miss Molly and her boyfriend are  
Kissing in the dark, dark, dark  
  
The dark is like a movie,  
A movie's like a show.  
A show is like a video  
And that is all I Know, know, know  
  
My mother is the queen,  
My father is king-kong,  
My sister is the physco one  
Who made this stupid song, song, song!
