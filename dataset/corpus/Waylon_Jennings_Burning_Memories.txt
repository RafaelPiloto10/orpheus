Tonight I'm burning old love letters  
Photographs and memories of you  
Hoping somehow I'll feel better  
And that when the smoke is gone I won't want you.  
  
Burning memories  
Teardrops fall while I am  
Burning memories  
Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose.  
  
My heart to you no longer matters  
And I can't live alone with memories  
Into the fire those dreams that you've shattered  
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free.  
  
Burning memories  
Teardrops fall while I am  
Burning memories  
Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose
