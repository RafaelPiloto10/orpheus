I keep tellin' myself this is the right thing to do  
I was wastin' her time, waitin' on dreams that just weren't comin' true  
And this old highway seems to understand  
Leadin' me on to somewhere that no one knows my name  
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up  
I'm doin' all that I can to get my mind off us  
  
What I need to do is turn this car around  
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown  
And run to her, take her in my arms  
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard  
But I drive on, and on, and on  
  
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue  
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do  
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee  
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep  
Now the sun's goin' down on my broken heart  
Lord, I gotta go back before I get too far  
  
What I need to do is turn this car around  
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown  
And run to her, take her in my arms  
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard  
But I drive on, and on, and on  
  
But I drive on  
Yes I drive on, and on, and on  
  
Knowin' what I need to do  
Girl, I'm comin' home to you  
  
Knowin' what I need to do  
Girl I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you  
Knowin' what I need to do...
