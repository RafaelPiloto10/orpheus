Lost in a feeling  
And this distance between us  
I start believing  
These days we're drifting apart  
We're leading separate lives  
Separately missing each other  
It's time that we face the light  
We can't go on pretending this way  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
When was the last time  
We were lost in the moment  
Seems like we can't find  
Oh, the love that we used to share  
If I could take you there  
Could we surrender together  
Somewhere to begin again  
Oh, it hurts just to go this way  
Yeah  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Somewhere there's love  
We've come this far  
Reach out your hand and I'll find where you are  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
Times that I let you down  
You could have just walked away  
Yes, I need your forgiveness now  
Don't say it's too late, yes  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Somewhere there's love  
We've come this far  
Reach out your hand and I'll find where you are  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
Oh, let me take you there  
Save a place for me baby  
Save a place in your heart  
Aw, let me take you there  
Leaving
