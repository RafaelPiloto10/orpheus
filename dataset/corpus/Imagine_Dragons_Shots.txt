[Intro]  
I'm sorry for everything  
Oh, everything I've done  
  
[Verse 1]  
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?  
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space  
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone  
  
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong  
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck  
Over and over and over again  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry for everything, no, everything I've done  
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun  
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved  
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved  
  
[Verse 2]  
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?  
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape  
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted  
  
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong  
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck  
Over and over and over again  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry for everything, no, everything I've done  
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun  
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved  
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved  
  
[Bridge]  
In the mean time, we let it go  
At the road sign we used to know  
We can let this drift away  
Oh we let this drift away  
At the bay side, we used to shore  
In the moonlight, we let it go  
We can let this drift away  
Oh we let this drift away  
Cause you've always got to change your mind  
Cause you've always got to change your mind  
Oh love, can you hear me?  
Oh let it drift away  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry for everything, no, everything I've done  
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun  
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved  
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved  
  
[Bridge]  
In the mean time, we let it go  
At the road sign we used to know  
We can let this drift away  
Oh we let this drift away  
At the bay side, we used to shore  
In the moonlight, we let it go  
We can let this drift away  
Oh we let this drift away  
Cause you've always got to change your mind  
Cause you've always got to change your mind  
Oh love, can you hear me?  
Oh let it drift away
