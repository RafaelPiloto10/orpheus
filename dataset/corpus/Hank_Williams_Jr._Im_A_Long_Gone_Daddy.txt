Well all you want to do is sit around and pout  
And now I've got enough so I'm gettin' out  
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I've been in the doghouse for so doggone long  
That when I get a kiss I think that somethin's wrong  
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right  
You go and get yourself a man that wants a fight  
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
You start your jaws a waggin' and they never stop  
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top  
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I remember back when you were nice and sweet  
Now things have changed you'd rather fight than eat  
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I'm gonna do some ridin' on the midnight train  
I'm taking evrything except my ball and chain  
Well I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow  
I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
