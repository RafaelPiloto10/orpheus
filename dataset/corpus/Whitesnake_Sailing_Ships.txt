Do you remember  
Standing on the shore,  
Head in the clouds,  
Your pockets filled with dreams  
Bound for glory  
On the seven seas of life,  
But, the ocean is deeper than it seems  
  
The wind was with you  
When you left on the morning tide,  
You set your sail for an island in the sun,  
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead,  
For the storm has just begun  
  
Take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
Lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water,  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
You're the one who holds the key,  
Or sailing ships will pass you by  
  
You cry for mercy,  
When you think you've lost your way,  
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone  
So find the strength and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
After all is said and done  
  
So take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
An' lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water,  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
You're the one who holds the key,  
Or sailing ships will pass,  
Sailing ships will pass you,  
Sailing ships will pass you by  
  
Take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
We'll ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
So sailing ships don't pass you by  
  
So take me with you,  
Take me far away,  
We'll ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control, your destiny,  
So sailing ships don't pass,  
So sailing ships don't pass you,  
So sailing ships don't pass you by  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby,  
You'll find that you're the only one  
Can sail your ship across the sky
