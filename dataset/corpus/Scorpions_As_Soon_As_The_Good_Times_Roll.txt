If you feel real sad sometimes  
Caught in bad vibrations  
And it seems you've lost your drive  
And your destination  
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by  
Catch the train of better times  
Rock tonight  
  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll  
  
If you feel that all your life  
Is packed with complications  
And almost everything you try  
Ends up in new frustrations  
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by  
Catch the train of better times  
Rock tonight  
  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll
