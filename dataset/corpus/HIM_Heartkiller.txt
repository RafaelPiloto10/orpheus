Farewell heartless world,  
I'll send you a postcard burnt in flames  
You've tried so hard to extinguish with the fear of failing,  
I'll write down everything I have learned,  
And edit it down to a single word "Love"  
For you I'm waiting, anticipating  
  
[Chorus]  
Sparks will fly beneath the Luna alight,  
Lazarus at Frankenstein's,  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
A little we die above the lesser light,  
For you I'm open wide,  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
  
Heartkiller  
  
Top hats off to the return,  
Of the beat to lick a wound  
Too cursed for some and blessed for a few,  
It doesn't have to make any sense at all,  
Come hither and we'll fall in love  
For love I'm crawling out of patience, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Paint all your sorrows for me to sing hearkiller  
Draw your pain and hear me hum it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heartkiller  
Heartkiller  
  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller
