You say you want to live some, move out into the fast lane  
You say you need excitement to make you come alive  
Some place a million miles from the shadows that surround you  
I look for your attention, you're lost out in the future  
Where lovers ask no questions and shadows never fall  
Some pilgrim bound for paradise, no compromise  
  
Paradise is here, it's time to stop your crying  
The future is this moment and not some place out there  
Tonight I need your love, don't talk about tomorrow  
  
Right now, I need your loving  
Right now, give it to me  
Right now, I want your loving  
Rigt now, now now now now  
  
You talk about your new plans to move on up the stairway  
You dream about the high life that's waiting for you there  
A world of fame and fortune just around the corner  
But I don't need no high life to make me feel a woman  
I don't need to reach for no castles in the sky  
Just put your arms around me, devour me  
  
Paradise is here, it's time to stop your crying  
The future is this moment and not some place out there  
Tonight I need your love, don't talk about tomorrow  
  
Right now, I need your loving  
Right now, give it to me  
Right now, I want your loving  
Right now  
  
Don't say tomorrow  
To give me sorrow
