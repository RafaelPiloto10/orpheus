The situation's clear  
It's fine as long as you are here  
Of that I'm really sure  
I will live to love you more  
  
The say you drag me down  
They try to tell me your around  
Just to even up a score  
But I will live to love you more  
  
And the say I've been blind  
That you deceive me every time  
And soon our love will end  
But I will live to love you again  
  
So what if they can't see  
You know I'll love endlessly  
And this they can't ignore  
I will live to love you more  
  
I know they're only rumors  
Although they say the truth hurts  
I don't need to hear lies  
And fantasize you leaving me  
  
But when I think it all over  
And over and over  
I still want you around me  
You know you astound me  
I couldn't live without you  
  
If there's a price to pay  
It's worth it just to hear you say  
All their lies ere just a bore  
I will live to love you more and more  
  
You know where my heart is  
With you alone  
My every thought is  
I will live to love you more
