I Cry  
  
When peace cannot be found  
And sleep won't visit me tonight  
A restless mind that I can't tame  
How off the floor I call Your name  
Sign of silence and the tears begin to fall  
  
I Cry  
And You're the one who hears me calling  
I fall  
So easily but You're there to catch me  
Say the words that heal me  
I'm safe when I'm with You  
You touch my eyes and I can see  
  
Oh the comfort that You bring  
When nothing else can reach inside  
Sympathetic friends are all around  
Their soothing words fall to the ground  
In silence I feel You here with me  
  
I Cry  
And You're the one who hears me calling  
I fall  
So easily but You're there to catch me  
Say the words that heal me  
I'm safe when I'm with You  
You touch my eyes and I can see  
  
I Cry  
And You're the one who hears me calling  
I fall  
So easily but You're there to catch me  
Say the words that heal me  
I'm safe when I'm with You  
You touch my eyes and I can see
