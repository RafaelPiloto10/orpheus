Saw you at a party  
You asked me to dance  
Said music was great for dancing  
I don't really dance much  
But this time I did  
And I was glad that I did this time  
And the song said "Let's be happy"  
I was happy  
It never made me happy before  
And the song said "Don't be lonely"  
It makes me lonely  
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more  
Where I belong, where I belong  
I wasn't dressed right, I rarely am  
You told me that you didn't care  
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes  
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward  
And the song said "Let's be happy"  
I was happy  
It never made me happy before  
And the song said "Don't be lonely"  
It makes me lonely  
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more  
Where I belong, where I belong  
And the song said "Let's be happy"  
I was happy  
It never made me happy before  
It asked "Do you remember?"  
And I remember, remember like it wasn't long ago  
And the song said "Don't be lonely"  
It makes me lonely  
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more  
Where I belong, where I belong
