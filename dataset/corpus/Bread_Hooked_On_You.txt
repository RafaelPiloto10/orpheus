Hooked On You Lyrics  
Baby if you only knew  
Everything I need I get from you  
I'll never let you out of sight  
I need you through the day and night, baby  
Always there to see me through  
Darlin' don't you know I'm hooked on you  
Habits I've had before  
But never came back so much for more  
I need your lovin' every day  
I couldn't live without it, no way  
And everybody knows it's true  
Everybody knows I'm hooked on you  
Well I've never been dependin'  
and never thought I would  
Oh but now I find that I don't mind,  
the change is for the good  
So don't be feelin' sorry,  
for the freedom that I lost  
'Cause I found out what I'm missin',  
and I'm glad to pay the cost  
Now that I've tasted you  
I know nobody else will ever do  
I'm glad that I can say you're mine  
I love ya 'cause your sugar's so fine  
And no one else'll ever do  
There's nothin' like bein' hooked on you  
Always there to see me through  
Baby that's why I'm hooked on you
