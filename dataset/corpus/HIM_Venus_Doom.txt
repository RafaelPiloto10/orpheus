Leave all behind now to watch her crawl  
Through our dark gardens of insanity  
She'll be the light to guide you back home  
Just give her a kiss worth dying for  
And open your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
My Venus doom  
All dreams are of you  
My Venus doom  
  
Grieve all your hearts out and she'll writhe enthralled  
In tragic ecstatic agony  
And in her flames we will die some more  
Just show me her life worth living for  
And light up the dark  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me inside your infernal offering  
Touch me as I fall  
Don't lose yourself in this suffering yet  
Hold on  
  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
My Venus doom  
All tears are of you  
My Venus doom
