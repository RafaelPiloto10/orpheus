I want to live alone in the desert  
I want to be like Georgia O'Keefe  
I want to live on the Upper East Side  
And never go down in the street  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I don't need no one  
Splendid Isolation  
  
Michael Jackson in Disneyland  
Don't have to share it with nobody else  
Lock the gates, Goofy, take my hand  
And lead me through the World of Self  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I don't need no one  
Splendid Isolation  
  
Don't want to wake up with no one beside me  
Don't want to take up with nobody new  
Don't want nobody coming by without calling first  
Don't want nothing to do with you  
  
I'm putting tinfoil up on the windows  
Lying down in the dark to dream  
I don't want to see their faces  
I don't want to hear them scream  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I don't need no one  
Splendid Isolation  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I don't need no one  
Splendid Isolation
