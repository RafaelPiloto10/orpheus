Bethlehem Star  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Mark Pay, Music by Steve Millikan, Ray Boltz,
and Mark Pay  
When God created the heaven and earth  
He said let there be light  
And a million shining stars appeared  
On the canvas of the night  
They all declared the glory  
Of the Father up above  
But only one startled the way  
To His greatest gift of love  
Chorus:  
Bethlehem starhow beautiful you are  
Shining in the darkness  
Guiding strangers from afar  
As your light fills the heavens  
His love fills my heart  
So shine for me mybethlehem star  
From far away the wise men came  
To find the tiny King  
In Bethlehem they worshipped Him  
And gave their offerings  
Star up in the heavens  
Without your holy light  
They would still be searching  
Somewhere in the night  
Chorus (repeat)  
I may not be a wise man  
And I don't have much to bring  
But my heart is my gift of love  
So lead me to the King  
Bethlehem starhow beautiful you are  
Shining in the darkness  
Guiding strangers from afar  
As your light fills the heavens  
His love fills my heart  
So shine for me mybethlehem star  
Oh that I might worship Him  
Shine for mebethlehem star
