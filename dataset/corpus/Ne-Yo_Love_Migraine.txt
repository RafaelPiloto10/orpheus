It's making  
My head hurt  
I gotta migrane  
Because your not  
Supposed to be here  
I don't wanna love you  
Your somebody else's  
Yeah  
She made it  
Perfectly clear  
She told me  
If I saw you tonight  
To tell you  
She forgives you  
And that she knows  
That we been together  
For about a year  
She said that she know  
That I love you  
But not like she does  
I think it'd be best  
If you got your things  
And got out of here  
I gotta migrane  
  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I can't take  
This love migrane  
My head don't hurt  
As much as my heart, no  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I can't take  
This love migrane  
My head don't hurt  
As much as my heart, no  
Just can't take  
This love migrane  
  
I wish you'd of told me  
That you had a daughter  
I would have  
Liked to meet her  
Would've been nice  
While were on the subject  
I want you to have it  
I guess you could have  
Mentioned the fact  
That you have a wife  
  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I can't take  
This love migrane  
My head don't hurt  
As much as my heart, no  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I can't take  
This love migrane  
My head don't hurt  
As much as my heart, no  
Just can't take  
This love migrane  
Just can't take  
This love migrane  
  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I can't take  
This love migrane  
My head don't hurt  
As much as my heart, no  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I can't take  
This love migrane  
My head don't hurt  
As much as my heart, no  
Just can't take  
This love migrane
