Can't go to sleep without you  
Starring in my dreams  
I can't get you out of my head  
I close my eyes, you're always there  
I lock the door  
But you're comin' up the stairs  
  
Can't stay awake  
I know I have to try  
What will it take to stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
How can I break  
The hold you have on me  
Angel will you never  
Ever set me free  
  
Oh angel, I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
You're an angel and I can't  
Stop you starring in my dreams  
  
How come you're givin' me  
These technicolor dreams  
How can I get you out of my head  
I close my eyes, you're always there  
How can I get you out of my bed  
  
I lie awake, all I see is you  
I'm going crazy, what can I do  
Switch off the light  
Then you start to call  
I lock the door  
Now you're coming through the wall  
  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Sweet angel, I can't stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
You're an angel and I can't  
Stop you starring in my dreams  
  
I can't stay awake much longer  
This feeling's getting stronger  
  
You must be an angel  
'Cause I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
You're an angel and I can't  
Stop you starring in my dreams  
  
Sweet angel, I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Wa
