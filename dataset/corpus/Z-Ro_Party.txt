Yo hey, yeah come here girl come on, uh..  
  
[Hook: x 2]  
Who want to party party, these hoes acting naughty  
They want to get with it, or they want to fuck somebody  
And so you know how I do it, you better ask somebody  
  
[Daz]  
I pick winners, let me see you come in first place  
I'm like the rabbit and turtle, see it's a long race  
You get to shaking and moving, working and hurting  
You slapping it up and you bruising, and girl it's curtains  
  
Shake your booty, leave my hand  
And dick print in her, and I go up in her  
She get managed, like the Asian wanting Spanish  
And you know I got to have it, put your mouth on me baby  
  
Get to fucking, and baby girl can't manage  
She can't stand, her ass bigger than the whole damn planet  
She don't look to better, like Janet  
But she'll do, and we'll do  
  
It's just another day, a bitch in my bed  
The same bitch, she be giving me head  
And when the bitch, make a nigga just cum  
Find out hoe, that you ain't the one

[Cl'Che]  
You want to party party, see me act naughty naughty  
And get me twisted off that Lime, Vodka and Bacardi  
You want to see me now, or you want to see me later  
Smoked out, in the back of your Navigator  
  
So let's party party, young playa playa  
I don't mean to stare, but what you swanging there  
I like to get it crunk, I'm tal'n bout pulling stunts  
Don't be shy break me off, in the front of the club  
  
You know, you want to fuck  
You know, you want to bust a nut  
So come on baby, why don't you give me what you got  
Break me off a stack, and you can see this pussy pop  
  
And if you front, you get's no love  
Cl'Che's looking for a thug  
You with that ladi-dadi, but I'm a hottie hottie  
Then Daz Dilinger said, you better ask somebody  
  
[Hook: x 2]  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Bitch you, ain't nothing but a greasy split  
Open your pussy hole for me, don't tease me bitch  
I'm put to put this log on you, from Michigan to Pamona  
Long as I got a rubber, Z-Ro gon bone a broad a day  
  
When I hit it, she gon injure her ankle like Hardaway  
Doggy style, come out and come back from a yard away  
Punish the panocha, I'm going south  
Do that thang with your mouth, and I'll be hard all over  
  
Look how they jock me, when I'm rocking the stage  
On that X and I'ma hit it, like I'm cocking a gauge  
I'm like em with hair down they back, or rocking the braids  
They love my dick, and want me to stay in they cot for the day  
  
But I got bidness to handle, and paper to chase  
Finish sucking my dick, and then get your ass out my face  
It ain't nothing personal, but I don't love you hoe  
You got some bomb ass pussy, but you got to go
