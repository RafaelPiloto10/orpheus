The river keeps on rolling  
My life stream keeps on flowing  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
My dreams call on tomorrow  
My love knows all my sorrow  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
  
Stay with me and we'll find a way  
I'll be your night if you'll be my day  
Through the dawn and beyond the sky  
We can fly, you and I  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
  
The river keeps on rolling  
My life stream keeps on flowing  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul
