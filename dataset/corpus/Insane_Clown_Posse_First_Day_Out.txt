First Day Out  
  
"Got another funky rhyme  
Another funky, funky rhyme  
Got another funky rhyme  
Another funky rhyme  
Another funky, funky rhyme"  
  
"Aw shit, man, that's the ICP!!!  
This is my jam!!!  
I'm on a psychedelic, motherfucking inter-gallactic void G!!!  
Aw, shit!"  
  
[Violent J]  
Well, they let the gate up so I bail  
It's been six months pick me up from the county jail  
With a smog mother payin' my dues  
Steel toliets, worn blankets, and rubber shoes  
But I ain't naggin'  
Here come the fellas I can hear the muffler draggin'  
Ain't been the car long  
And the Faygo is almost gone  
My nuts are kinda hard so I need a mate  
So my homeboy's cousin set me up with a blind date  
She said "Pick me up at three"  
Can't bitch, the bus don't ride your street, ho  
We gonna eat at Mexican Village  
Take a cab and I'll pay the tab  
And when she showed, well, I'll be damned  
Left my wallet at home on the TV stand  
Have her pay him and for dinner too  
The knot in my sock, it done bit you  
She's all prettied up for nothing  
I'm smelling like shit and my chin is scruffing  
And I'm chewing on my food like a pitbull  
Cause I won't front for the ho  
Stuck my face in a bowl of soup  
And just sucked it all up threw my missin' tooth  
The bitch jumped up with a boom  
"I have to fix my hair" and broke to the bathroom  
She's got the tab, so I go for mine  
And order up some '52 vintage wine  
Hey, Louie, bring a fuckin' steak with that  
Motherfuckers like jail say fuck dat  
She's back now and her hair ain't fixed  
Probably took a long greasy-ass smelly shit  
I ain't saying nothing though  
I ain't saying nothing bout the funkin' ho  
What's up bitch, I'm ready to break  
How long can one fat bitch take?  
Quite snacking and pay me saps  
Cause we goin' home to meet her pops  
  
"So Joe, what is that you do for a living?"  
"Aww, come on pops, you seen me selling rocks on  
Verner and Springwell. Matter fact, I think I sold  
to that fat bitch in the kitchen"  
  
[Violent J]  
Your dad's really cool sweetheart  
I mean him letting me use his car  
And he slipped me a fifty  
Violent J is kinda nifty  
If I'd a hit you'd be home through  
But now your coming home with me  
Dad I gotta bitch in the bedroom  
Take your ass to the bar and don't come home soon  
Now the juggla's known to smack hoes  
But I need the shot too  
So I switch to the mack mode  
  
"Now woman, you know I love you  
So why don't you just let me fuck you  
Now bitch, I know you's a freak  
So let me get a little kiss on your cheek  
And a fuck to go with that  
Come on, nympho, let me hit that  
Tell ya what you let me stick it  
And I gotta left over piece of chicken for ya  
Ya little sewer skank  
Ya nasty little pipe-smoking sac-chasing ho  
And that was that  
A little smooth talking she was on her back  
And I'm finally sticking  
Dump ya, and I'm eating my chicken  
You'll never guess what  
My first day out and I caught my nut"  
  
First day out and I caught my nut
