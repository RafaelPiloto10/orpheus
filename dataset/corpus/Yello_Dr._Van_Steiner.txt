I can't separate your fiction from fact  
You're lost, I know you're trying to wind your way back  
You've been talking as fast as you can  
I'm not listening anymore  
  
Now baby  
You're changing all the rules  
You're taking advantage of a fool  
  
Good evening  
I'm Ed Burroughs  
And the name of this show is "Person To Person"  
Tonight we're visiting the home of a very famous motion picture  
And television director  
Dr. Van Steiner, I'm very sorry I'm unable to attend this tremendous  
Occasion being given in your honor  
I would like to extend my sincerest best wishes to you
