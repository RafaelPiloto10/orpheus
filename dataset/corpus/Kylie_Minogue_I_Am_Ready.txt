We can drown any rumours bout winners and losers sayin  
"I aint' ready for that"  
When the love needs to grow and the world wants to  
Know, we gotta keep it under your hat.  
Bridge  
Sometimes those close to you find it hard to feel your pain  
Sometimes you wanna surrender, but you say here I come again.  
Chorus  
I'm the survivor  
Even denier  
I felt compasion even with knives in my back  
But you know it aint over when you feel the tears dry  
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it don't seem so black  
Oh I belive in the love that your givin and I'm ready for that yeah  
(I'm a survivor, I felt compasion,  
I'm a survivor, you can laugh at the clouds in the  
Sky aint it don't seem so bad)  
  
Feelings gone and fast then it's suddenly back you were  
Over and now your a queen,  
You forget who you are for they made you a star now  
Your hotter than you ever been  
Bridge  
Sometimes those close to you find it hard to feel your pain  
Sometimes you wanna surrender, but you say here I come again.  
Chorus  
I'm the survivor  
Even denier  
I felt compasion even with knives in my back  
But you know it aint over when you feel the tears dry  
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it don't seem so black  
Oh I belive in the love that your givin and I'm ready for that yeah  
I'm the survivor  
Even denier
