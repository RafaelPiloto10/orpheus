How can I just let you walk away,  
Just let you leave without a trace,  
When I'm standing taking every breath,  
With you, ooohhh,  
You're the only one who really knew me,  
At all.  
  
How can you just walk away from me,  
When all I can do is watch you leave,  
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain,  
And even shared the tears,  
You're the only one who really knew me at all.  
  
So take a look at me now,  
There's just an empty space,  
There's nothing left here to remind me,  
Just the memory of your face,  
So take a look at me now,  
There's just an empty space,  
If you're coming back to me it's against the odds,  
And that's what I've got to face.  
  
I wish I could just make you turn around,  
Turn around and see me cry,  
There's so much I need to say to you,  
So many reasons why,  
You're the only one who really knew me at all.  
  
So take a look at me now,  
There's just an empty space,  
There's nothing left here to remind me,  
Just the memory of your face,  
So take a look at me now,  
So there's just an empty space,  
But to wait for you is all I can do,  
When that's what I've got to face.  
  
Take a good look at me now,  
Cause I'll be standing here,  
(Mark: Standing here)  
And you coming back to me is against the odds,  
And that's the chance I've got to take.  
  
Got to take  
Got to take  
  
Ooh  
Take a look at me now  
  
Take a look at me now.
