Christmas always goes too fast  
It's up to us make it last  
And all I want for Christmas is love  
  
Come that morning and I see you smile  
It only lasts a little while  
How come we seem to push it all side?  
  
Don't you know that it's  
Christmas time again, I'm happy for you  
You know it comes and goes  
So let's pretend that it'll last all year  
  
Soon, it seems to disappear  
It brings us towards but leaves the tear  
The day is down but spirit should remain  
  
It's times like these we need a change  
I care enough to rearrange  
I'll make sure it'll last all year  
  
Don't you know that it's  
Christmas time again, I'm happy for you  
You know it comes and goes  
So let's pretend that it'll last all year  
  
Christmas time again, I'm happy for you  
You know it comes and goes  
So let's pretend that it'll last all year, oh  
  
Gotta give a little more  
Remember what we're thanking for  
All my love, my kind  
  
Let's pretend just this time  
Let's keep the flow this times  
That our Christmas will last all year  
  
Don't you know that it's  
Christmas time again, I'm happy for you  
You know it comes and goes  
So let's pretend that it'll last all year  
  
Christmas time again, I'm happy for you  
You know it comes and goes  
So let's pretend that it'll last all year  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel
