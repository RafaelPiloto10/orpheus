If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye  
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry  
When waking from a bad dream  
Don't you sometimes think it's real?  
But it's only false emotions that you feel  
  
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long  
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song  
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky  
So let your hair down and go on and cry
