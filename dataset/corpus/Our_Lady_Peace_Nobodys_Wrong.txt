Early version of Birdman from Demo  
  
You sit alone, marking time  
Hiding behind disposition  
Birdman wants to get inside of your mind  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right open the blinds  
People, I know you people Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right its all on the outside  
  
Through the cracks you hear it live  
Let's talk about information  
You sit back and criticize, you criticize  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right you give him a ride  
People, I know you people Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right its all on the outside  
  
This man, a lunatic wants to be right  
To realize one disguise  
But I'm doing fine  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right its all on the outside  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right People, I know you people Get it on Get  
it on Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on and on and on Get it on  
Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on
