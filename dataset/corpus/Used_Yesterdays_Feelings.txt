Close my eyes and move to the back of my mind  
The worries are washed out to sea  
See the changes, people's faces blurred out  
Like sunspots or raindrops  
  
Now all those feelings, those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time  
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind  
  
Left the only worries I had in my hands  
Away from the light in my eyes  
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel  
  
Now feelings mean nothing  
  
All those feelings, those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time  
But today I've wasted away for today is on my mind (today is on my mind)  
  
I can't get a worry  
I'm feeling so lonely  
Breaking apart all this love in my heart  
Close my eyes and move to the back of my mind  
  
Where feelings mean nothing  
  
All those feelings, those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time  
But today I've wasted away, for today is on my mind  
But today I've wasted away, for today is on my mind  
But today I've wasted away, for today is on my mind  
  
I can't get a worry  
I'm feeling so lonely  
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
