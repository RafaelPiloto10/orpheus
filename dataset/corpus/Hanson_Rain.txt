Rain fallin' down outta my eyes  
And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye  
And leave me baby, all alone in my life.  
  
As I think back when you were around  
And we were together, we didn't care about the weather  
'cause baby we were together.  
  
But now that you're gone, I have to say,  
The rain is falling down each and every day,  
Outta my eyes and I'm wondering why.  
  
Rain falling down outta my eyes,  
And I'm wonderin' why you had to say goodbye  
And leave me baby, all in my life.  
Rain falling down outta my eyes,  
And I'm wondering why you had to say goodbye,  
And leave me baby all alone in my life.  
  
Well, it's cold outside and it's not summer anymore  
And so I have to go inside and shut the door.  
Perhaps if you were here, the weather wouldn't seem as bad,  
But since you've been gone,  
I've been so very sad.  
  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why.  
Rain fallin' down outta my eyes, baby.  
And I'm wonderin' why.
