Way down  
I've been way down  
Underneath this skin  
Waiting to hear my name again  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
If I hear them calling  
And nothing can hold me  
  
Way down (Do you really want me?)  
All the way down (Do you really want me?)  
I will hear your voice (Do you really want me?)  
But I'll no longer understand (No one's really loved me)  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling  
  
I was looking to the sky  
When I knew I'd be swimming home  
And I cannot betray my kind  
They are here, it's my time  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me (Do you really want me?)  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling, (calling)  
And nothing can hold me
