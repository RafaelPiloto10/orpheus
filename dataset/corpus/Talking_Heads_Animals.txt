I'm mad and that's a fact  
I found out animals don't help  
Animals think they're pretty smart  
Shit on the ground, see in the dark  
  
They wander around like a crazy dog  
Make a mistake in the parking lot  
Always bumping into things  
Always let you down, down, down, down  
Eh, eh, eh, eh  
  
Animals think they understand  
Trusting them, a big mistake  
Animals want to change my life  
I will ignore, animals' advice  
  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them down  
Down, down, down  
  
I know the animals are laughing at us  
Don't even know what a joke is  
I won't follow animals' advice  
I don't care if they're laughing at us  
  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them down  
Down, down  
Eh, eh, eh  
  
They say they don't need money  
They're living on nuts and berries  
They say animals don't worry  
They're living on nuts and berries  
  
You know animals are hairy?  
They say animals don't worry  
They think they know what's best  
They're making a fool of us  
  
They ought to be more careful  
They're setting a bad example  
They say animals don't worry  
They're living on nuts and berries  
  
They're setting a bad example  
They ought to be more careful  
You know animals are hairy?  
They're living on nuts and berries  
  
They want to know what's best  
They're making a fool of us  
They ought to be more careful  
They're setting a bad example  
  
They like to laugh at people  
They're setting a bad example  
They have untroubled lives  
They think every thing's nice  
  
They say they don't need money  
They say animals don't worry  
They're living on nuts and berries  
You know animals are hairy?  
  
They think they know what's best  
They're making a fool of us  
They like to laugh at people  
They're making a bad example  
  
They say they don't need money  
You know animals are hairy?  
They're living on nuts and berries  
They say they don't need money  
They're setting a bad example
