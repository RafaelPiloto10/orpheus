When I was younger she'd come to me in dreams  
Her face was hidden in the mountain streams  
Her voice disguised as the sound of the wind  
The rustling of leaves, she would call from within  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
So many memories of those years have passed  
Beyond the confusion, that thought would last forever  
The countless veils that I wore like clothes  
Have been stripped away, now stand here exposed  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
In the night when the moon casts no shadows at all  
We sat by the fire as she started to call  
Out to all who would hear that the death of what's dead  
Is the birth of what's living and her words filled my head  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
It's the life that lies sleeping when you think you're awake  
Forever is real and the rest is just fake  
And though volumes are written on this subject alone  
She used three simple words and she brought it all home  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead
