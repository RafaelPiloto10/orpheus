I was born in a house with the television always on  
Guess I grew up too fast  
And I forgot my name  
We're in cities at night and we got time on our hands.  
So leave the driving to us.  
And it's the real thing.  
  
And you're rolling  
In the blender  
With me.  
And I can love you  
Like a color  
TV.  
  
Now love is here  
C'mon and try it  
I got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
And now love is here  
C'mon and try it  
Got love for sale,  
Got love for sale.  
  
You can put your lipstick all over my designer jeans.  
I'll be a video for you.  
If you turn my dial.  
You can cash my check if you go down to the bank  
You get two for one  
For a limited time.  
  
Push my button...  
The toast pops up  
Love and money  
Gettin' all  
Mixed up  
And now love is here  
C'mon and try it.  
I got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
  
Love is here  
C'mon and try it  
I got love for sale  
I got Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love
