Back in 1953, we stole a car old Merle and me  
Never thinking wed be put in jail  
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen  
When they put those bars between old Merle and me  
  
Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall  
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds  
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last  
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me  
  
We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend  
Acting like wed never been in reform school  
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high  
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me  
  
We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done  
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know  
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell  
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me  
  
How was Merle or me to know, we would end up on death row  
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair  
Shot down in a grocery store, we got busted at the door  
Praying wasn't easy for old Merle and me
