Here come dick, he's wearing a skirt  
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain  
Same hair, revolution  
Same build, evolution  
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss  
  
And they love each other so  
Androgynous  
Closer than you know, love each other so  
Androgynous  
  
Don't get him wrong and don't get him mad  
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad  
And she don't need advice that he send to her  
She's happy with the way she looks  
She's happy with her gender  
  
Mirror image, see no damage  
See no evil at all  
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls  
They'll be laughed at  
The way you're laughed at now  
  
Now, something meets Boy, and something meets Girl  
They both look the same  
They're overjoyed in this world  
Same hair, revolution  
Unisex, evolution  
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss  
And tomorrow dick is wearing pants  
And tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress  
Future outcasts and they don't last  
And today, the people dress the way that they please  
The way they tried to do in the last centuries
