I'd love to get you on a slow boat to China  
All by myself, alone  
Get you and keep you in my arms evermore  
Leave all your lovelies weeping on the far away shore  
  
Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself, alone  
  
All to myself alone  
Leave all your lovelies  
Weeping on the far away shore  
  
Out on the briny with a moon big and shiny  
Melting your heart of stone  
I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China  
All to myself, all to myself  
All to myself alone
