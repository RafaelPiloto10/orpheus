After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight, we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout  
We're gonna stimulate some action  
We're gonna get some satisfaction  
We're gonna find out what it is all about  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight, we're gonna shake your tambourine  
After midnight, it's all gonna be peaches and cream  
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion  
We're gonna give an exhibition  
We're gonna find out what it is all about  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight, we're gonna shake your tambourine  
After midnight, it's all gonna be peaches and cream  
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion  
We're gonna give an exhibition  
We're gonna find out what it is all about  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down  
After midnight, we're gonna let it all hang down
