Sometimes it's hard to be a woman  
Givin' all your love to just one man  
You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times  
Doin' things that you don't understand  
  
But if you love him, then you'll forgive him  
Even though he's hard to understand  
And if you love him, oh, be proud of him  
'Cause after all he's just a man  
  
Stand by your man  
Give him two arms to cling to  
And somethin' warm to come to  
When nights are cold and lonely  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin' all the love you can  
Stand by your man  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin' all the love you can  
Stand by your man
