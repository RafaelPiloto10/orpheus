I'm feelin' static  
Nothing's moving here for me  
Dead un-romantic  
That's the way life's squeezin' me  
I get the feelings  
When I'm pushed in a situation  
Like climbin' ceilings  
This is a case of renegotiaion  
I ain't the soft touch you think I am  
Ain't no pussy to think you care  
  
Between a rock and a hard place  
I'll make sure you remember my face  
Between a rock and a hard place  
You're just something I will erase  
  
I'll tell you something  
That you never thought before  
When I get dangerous  
There's no such thing as outside the law  
Let me tell you, for your information  
You're gonna need rehabilitation  
  
Between a rock and a hard place  
I'll make sure you remember my face  
Between a rock and a hard place  
You're just something I will replace  
  
There's no giving up, no more losing ground  
Hang on in  
We're gonna stick around, movin' up  
You can't bring me down..
