Look at me I'm fallin'  
Off of a cliff now  
I can still hear my mama yelling No No No  
But the words mean nothing  
  
Can't catch up to me now  
And the view is so beautiful  
All the way down  
When I was a little boy  
  
Suckin' juice from a bottle  
Believing my perceptions were oh so real  
But I don't know nothing  
Still knowing nothing  
  
Was just enough for me to know the way I feel  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Look at me I'm swollen  
Like a banana fish now  
I'm never gonna make it out of my hole  
But I keep on laughing  
  
Doesn't really matter  
There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul  
When I was a teenager  
Suckin' booze with the Vatos  
  
Discussing who was gonna live to be 21  
They said they wouldn't make it  
They didn't make it  
We're all naked when the day is said and done  
  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Don't know who made this all come true  
But now while you're here  
You just gotta do what you gotta do  
Now if I wasn't such a weenie  
  
Do you think you'd still love me  
Pretending I'm an airplane on the living  
Room floor  
But like a lovely generator  
  
You stand right by me  
And if words were wisdom I'd be talking  
Even more  
So I keep on falling  
  
As I'm looking back above me  
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot  
Now I'm like DeNiro  
I'm amarillo  
  
And I'll never know when I hit the ground
