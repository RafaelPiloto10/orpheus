And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadows of my heart  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wandered down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that would not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
The lonely nights dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
And beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You were in my arms  
Nightingale tells it's fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses grew  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it always will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain  
  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
Oh, but that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You were in my arms  
The nightingale tell it's fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses grew  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain
