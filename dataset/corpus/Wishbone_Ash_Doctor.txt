Doctor can you help me please  
I'm laying on the floor  
I need a glass of something  
Like you gave me once before  
I'll send my little messenger  
He'll bring the money to you  
He'll slowly make his way back home  
There'll be no horror show today my friends  
And me well be up and get away  
CHORUS:  
If I fill your every need  
You won't feel so empty  
In my web I'll bet your life  
You're dead before you're thirty  
Doctor can you help me please  
I trust you like my mum  
I know that you won't stop me turning  
All the whole world on  
You know that I'll always come to you  
When everything goes wrong  
You pick me up, don't let me go down  
To the horror show today my friend  
And me well be up and get away
