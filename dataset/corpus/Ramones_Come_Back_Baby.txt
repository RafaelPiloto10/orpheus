Well life's a drag without you  
I found out a little bit too late, oh yes I did now  
  
I want you and all of your time  
I found out a little bit too late, oh yes I did now  
  
Come back baby, come back Come back baby, come back  
Come back baby, come back Come back into my arms  
  
Well I want you in my arms  
I found out a little bit too late, oh yes I did now  
  
Yeah, I want you and all of your time  
I found out a little bit too late, oh yes I did now  
  
I want you to kiss goodnight (you gotta come back)  
I want you to hold big time (come back, yeah) (You gotta come back)
