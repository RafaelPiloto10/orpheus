All my life you know I haven't been very love strong  
There's been so many fights that I fought and I never won  
So I decided that I should just give up in trying to right your wrongs  
And word on the street is she did to you what you did to me.  
  
Five, four, three, two, one  
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!  
Your goin' down, down, down, boy  
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed  
Bang! she shot you.  
Karma tastes so  
Bang! Bang! Bang! Boy!  
Your goin' down, down, down, boy  
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed  
Bang! she shot you.  
Karma tastes so sweet  
  
So unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you  
Bending and breaking the rules that we're making exceptions too  
  
But how does it feel!  
To swim in your own tears!  
You lied and you lied  
And I died and I died  
And now you know why  
  
Five, four, three, two, one  
Bang bang bang boy  
Your goin' down down down boy  
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed.  
Bang! She shot you!  
Karma tastes so bang bang bang boy  
Your goin' down down down boy  
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed  
Bang! she shot you!  
Karma tastes so bang bang bang boy  
Your goin' down down down boy  
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed  
Bang! she shot you!  
Karma tastes so sweet
