Whoa, whoa, whoa, who knows  
  
When I was a baby child  
My daddy said to me  
Many mountains we must climb  
Before we'll be free  
But he never told me  
About the bruises on my knees  
How they would be the map  
That leads to where we need to be  
That sun goes down  
Forty days, forty nights  
  
Who knows  
What the thunder and lightning will bring  
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams  
Maybe the sun will shine no more  
Who knows  
Which way the wind is blowing  
And when we look back on these things  
We won't cry no more  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who knows  
  
Wandering blindly  
Searching for the truth  
And anchored to a solid rock  
That we could hold on to  
But there's no tomorrow  
Not for everyone  
Who will hear your last harsh words  
When your time on earth is done  
That sun goes down down  
Forty days, forty nights  
  
Who knows  
What the thunder and lightning will bring  
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams  
Maybe the sun will shine no more  
Who knows  
Which way the wind is blowing  
And when we look back on these things  
We won't cry no more  
  
Whoa tilt the lamp now  
Don't let the wind blow it out  
Oh guide the light child  
'Cause one day it's gonna shine  
Sing up 'til the darkness it is lifted  
Sing up 'til the darkness it is lifted
