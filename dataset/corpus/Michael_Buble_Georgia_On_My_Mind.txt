Georgia, Georgia  
The whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
On my mind  
  
I said Georgia, mmm, Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear  
As moonlight through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Oh, Georgia, Georgia  
No peace I find  
Just an old sweet song, old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Oh, just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
There'll always be Georgia
