Bestow upon me knowledge  
Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise  
I want to rule my kingdom  
Make sweet the breeze, not once defiled  
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists in velvet gloves of sin  
Parade the grey-robed monks, the vestal virgins  
And wheel the wyvern's in  
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage  
Let me be the protege of five magics  
  
Give me alchemy!  
Give me sorcery!  
Give me wizardry!  
Thermatology!  
Electricity!  
  
Master all of these  
Magic if you please  
Bring him to his knees  
I master five magics  
Possessed with hellish torment  
I master magics "5"  
Hunting the abyss lord  
Only one will stay alive  
He who lives by the sword will surely also die  
He who lives in sin will surely live the lie
