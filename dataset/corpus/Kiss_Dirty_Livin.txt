I can't get enough of what I need  
People all around me lettin' me bleed  
Waitin' for the darkness to blind the heat  
I make my livin' out on the streets  
  
Dirty livin', ahh, dirty livin'  
I can't wait any longer to set myself free  
  
Flashin' lights keep runnin' through my brain  
Someone find the doctor to ease all the pain  
Traffic in the city is burnin' me out  
She makes me want to jump up and shout  
  
Dirty livin', ahh, dirty livin'  
I can't wait any longer to set myself free, ahh  
I can't wait any longer to set myself free, ahh  
  
No more, no more  
I've gotta get away  
  
Dirty livin', dirty livin'  
Ahh, dirty livin'  
  
Late night outta China is due in tonight  
Mother, sister, brother are lyin' uptight  
I can hear the jukebox poundin' out loud  
I take my fury out on the crowd  
  
Dirty livin', ahh, dirty livin'  
I can't wait any longer to set myself free, ahh  
I can't wait any longer to set myself free, ahh  
  
No more, no more  
I've gotta get away  
Dirty livin', dirty livin'  
It's gettin' to me, it's gettin' to me  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
Dirty livin', dirty livin', yeah  
Why don't you set me free
