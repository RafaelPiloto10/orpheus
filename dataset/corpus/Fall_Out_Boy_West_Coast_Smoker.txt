Wishes bounce me weightless  
The infrared scope of pointlessness  
The bulls are sedated and this fights fixed  
  
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats  
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right  
The P.A. system keeps my hard heart beating tonight  
  
(Oh hell yes)  
I'm a nervous wreck  
(Oh hell yes)  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
[Chorus]  
Knock once for the Father  
Twice for the Son  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
  
Come on in, the water's warm  
Come on like I sugared you, but with a kick in the head  
Like putting wings on lead  
Your eyes are black in my starlight  
I'm the last of my kind  
(And as always I'm not addicted to you)  
  
Follow the disorganized religion of my head  
And we'll never get through customs  
Let's just take off again instead  
  
Got my degree in the gutter  
My heart broken in the dorms of the Ivy League  
  
(Oh hell yes)  
I'm a nervous wreck  
(Oh hell yes)  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm a nervous wreck [Repeat: x3]  
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck  
(I'm a nervous wreck)  
I'm a nervous wreck  
(Oh hell yes)  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Three times)  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
(Three times)  
Three times for the Holy Ghost
