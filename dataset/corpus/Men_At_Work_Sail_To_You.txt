Now there is this place  
With so much space  
It's at the bottom of the world  
So it lay unspoiled  
  
Wind and rain, hurricane  
And the black man reigned  
Till the white man came  
  
They sailed to you  
Sail to you  
  
People talk there  
And they talk here  
About the new world  
They say its the last frontier  
But its so one dimension  
I feel apprehension  
And you can't disguise  
The condescension  
  
I sail to you  
I sail to you  
  
Dear old England had a mind  
Around that time  
'Cause they had a few problems with  
The rising crime  
  
Wouldn't lose our head  
If you stole a loaf of bread  
You got a one way ticket  
To Australia instead  
  
I don't know why, I don't even try  
To work out all of the reasons why  
Well its like a drug--gets in the blood  
Calls me back and that's enough  
  
I fly to you  
Fly to you  
  
I don't care and you don't care  
All I know that's its there  
Breath the air into my lungs  
And pray that doomsday never comes  
  
Sail to you  
Sail to you
