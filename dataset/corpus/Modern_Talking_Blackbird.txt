Just tomorrow, there's another day  
Another way in your life  
It's not easy, oh it's not easy to say  
If our dreams will survive  
I know I can't ignore it  
It's the end of our love  
I know the time will show it  
To my heart  
  
Blackbird don't fly away (fly away)  
See you in heaven  
Miss you more and more each day (more each day)  
It's five to seven  
Spread your wings, don't fly away  
Blackbird don't fly away (fly away)  
Blackbird don't fly away  
Blackbird don't fly away  
  
Remember when you said to me  
I'm blind to see our love  
I remember you were my destiny  
Tell me why you break my heart  
Yesterday is gone forever  
Every day is a new day  
I swear I'll love you forever  
And I say  
  
Blackbird don't fly away (fly away)  
See you in heaven  
Miss you more and more each day (more each day)  
It's five to seven  
Spread your wings, don't fly away  
Blackbird don't fly away (fly away)  
Blackbird don't fly away  
Blackbird don't fly away(fly away - fly away - fly away)  
  
Don't fly away (away)
