Did you know the waters turning yellow?  
Have you heard the sky was falling down?  
Did you see that guy fall out the window?  
Did you know the circus was in town?  
  
Have you heard about Bill Chambers mother?  
She said a woman's work is never done.  
And oh yes, about that yellow water,  
Have you noticed the color of the sun?  
  
You have a way of making everything you say seem unreal  
Are you aware that the people who care are mostly stainless steel?  
  
Well I heard you finally got my letter.  
It should have come about this time last year.  
And I hope Bill Chamber's mother's better.  
Oh did the moon just disappear?  
  
You have a way of making everything you say seem unreal  
Are you aware that the people who care are mostly stainless steel?
