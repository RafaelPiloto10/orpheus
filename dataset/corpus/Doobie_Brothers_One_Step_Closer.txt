Baby, there's a chance you ought to take  
Chance of a mistake you gotta make  
Maybe I'm mistaken too  
To take my chance with you  
I need you like a shadow needs a light  
I'll follow you like morning follows night  
When nothin's left ahead of you  
I'll be right behind you  
Shadows disappear at night  
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one  
Why is it so hard to find  
Tell me that you're right there too  
  
One step baby  
Two steps maybe  
One step closer  
I'll be next to you  
  
Baby, it's a secret I can't keep  
Trouble comes and suddenly you're weak  
I don't believe you got the strength  
To fight this kind of love  
I know it's risky now and then,  
What with all the what ifs and the when's  
Who is there to say we're wrong  
To tell us it can't be  
Come on, baby, please don't go  
I'm heart of stone and you know why is it so hard to do  
Tell me that you're right there too, baby  
Baby, can't you see we're runnin' late  
Can't you see we ain't got time to wait  
Might be that you're scared of me  
Of something you might feel  
Hold on to me, baby, hold on tight  
I can take us through the night all right  
Maybe I will stay here too  
Take my chance with you  
  
Shadows disappear at night  
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one  
Why is it so hard to find  
Tell me that you're right there too  
  
One step baby  
Two steps maybe  
One step closer
