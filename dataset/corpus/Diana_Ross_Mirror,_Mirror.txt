Mirror, mirror  
On the wall  
You said you had the answers to it all  
You never told me I'd take a fall  
  
Mirror, mirror  
On the wall  
  
You, you turned my life  
Into a paperback novel  
Words that come to life  
Inside your little melodrama  
  
Chapter one  
When I was young  
I came to you with my problems  
Chapter two  
You promised me love  
And anything that I desired  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
Thought you said you had the answers to it all  
Never told me I was gonna take a fall  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
  
You have nailed my heart  
Upon the wall for your pleasures  
You have cast a spell  
That cannot ever be broken  
  
And now  
My eyes grow tired  
I watch my picture getting older  
But I  
Remain the same  
Trapped in this mirror forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I talk to you each night  
And I follow your advise  
You've been wrong  
What's the price I have to pay  
For this fairy tale thing called love?  
Let me go!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Let me go  
Mirror, mirror [Repeat: x4]  
  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
Thought you said you had the answers to it all  
Never told me I was gonna take a fall  
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall  
  
Tell me mirror [Repeat: x4]
