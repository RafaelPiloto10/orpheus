Have you read the message, the writing on the wall  
Could it be the answer, the answer to it all  
What's going down in heaven, I'm playing with your head  
Don't believe them when they tell you, you'd be better off dead  
  
Living in the thunder driving me insane  
Can I get a witness to take away the pain  
Walking on the water going nowhere fast  
Feeling like I'm walking with no shoes on broken glass  
You know it  
  
You don't have to leave me lights on  
I'm so used to being blind  
No more goodbyes or yesterdays  
So it's I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow  
  
Welcome to the sideshow, I'll cut to the chase  
Yeah I can hear you thinking it's going all to waste  
I don't mean to offend you when I look you in the eyes  
What's all this commotion? It leaves me mystified  
  
Chasing all the rainbows falling from the sky  
I know your intentions are all a bunch of lies  
I'm running out of patience, falling off track  
You better start to worry, 'cause I may not make it back  
All right now  
  
You don't have to leave me the lights on  
I'm so used to being blind  
One good reason to blow me away  
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow  
  
Can it wait 'til tomorrow?  
'Cause tomorrow never comes...  
  
Living in the big house, dying by the rail  
If I wanted your opinion I'd call you in hell  
Could that be the mailman knockin' on the door  
Or just another lightweight finally evening the score  
You know it  
  
You don't have to leave me the lights on  
Now I'm so used to being blind  
No more goodbyes or yesterdays  
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow  
No more good reasons to blow you away  
So it's I'll see you tomorrow
