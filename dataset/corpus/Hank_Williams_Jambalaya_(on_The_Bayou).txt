Goodbye Joe me gotta go, me oh my oh  
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou  
My Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou  
  
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o  
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou  
  
Thibodaux Fontaineaux the place is buzzin'  
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen  
Dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou  
  
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o  
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou  
  
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o  
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
