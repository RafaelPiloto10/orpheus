Wham!  
Another summer  
Another vacation is over  
A September morning,  
With the sun and the smell of the clover  
  
Down by the gate  
We sit and we watch all our friends go by  
And pretend we don't hear the bell,  
That rings through the summer sky.  
  
I was happy with the kiss that she gave me,  
It's just that happy was all she made me  
Happy that was  
Until I saw you  
  
[Chorus]  
Heart beat, heart beat,  
Why do you fail me now?  
You hurt me, desert me,  
In my darkest hour  
Heartbeat, heartbeat,  
Why do you keep me here?  
How could I help but admire her beauty?  
Standing on the line between desire and duty  
Heartbeat, heartbeat  
It will end in tears  
  
I need a lover,  
But love's such a dangerous place to be  
Oh, if we were meant for each other,  
Then why won't you answer me?  
  
Don't keep me waiting,  
You know that I long to be by your side  
We could even be together,  
Tonight  
  
I was happy with the kiss that she gave me  
But now there's nothing on Earth to save me  
Why should I care?  
I can't have you  
  
[Chorus]
