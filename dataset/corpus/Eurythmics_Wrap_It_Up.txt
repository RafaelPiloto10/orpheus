I've been watching you for days now baby  
I just love your sexy ways now baby  
You know my love will never stop now baby  
Just put your loving in my box baby  
  
Wrap it up, I'll take it [Repeat: x4]  
  
No more will I shop around now baby  
You know I've got the best thing in town now baby  
I've seen all I want to see baby  
What your loving means to me now baby  
  
Wrap it up, I'll take it [Repeat: x4]  
  
I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are  
Give you sweet things from my candy jar  
You've got treats you ain't never used  
Give it give it to me  
It won't get abused
