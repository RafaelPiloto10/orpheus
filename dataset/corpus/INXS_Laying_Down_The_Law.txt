I'm laying down the law  
Showdown in the north land  
Just the whiff of corruption  
Is the tip of the iceberg  
  
Savor and sweet liberty  
And there's trouble from the south  
Shouting from the gallery  
Now I find I've got to shut it out  
  
I'm searching for a light  
To kill my sense of fear  
To break through darkened nights  
And take me through the years  
  
There's no need to tell you  
What I think has gone wrong  
There's grey clouds of dissension  
Let it show, let it show a silver lining  
  
Sweet blood on the razor  
Is it poetry or politics?  
Forget about the nightmare  
I'll make it a dream that changes everything  
  
I'm searching for a light  
To kill my sense of fear  
To break through darkened nights  
And take me through the years  
  
Sweet blood on the razor  
Is it poetry or politics?  
Forget about the nightmare  
I'll make it a dream that changes everything  
  
I'm searching for a light  
To kill my sense of fear  
To break through darkened nights  
And take me through the years
