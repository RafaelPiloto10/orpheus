Mister Fiddle, Oh mister Fiddle, well all right  
Mister fee-fi-fiddle-e-i-o  
He wears a great big fringe, he's your southern friend  
One sure that you all know  
Folks invitated, he's the one that make it  
He's mister Fiddle with the bow  
  
Oh, fee-fi-fiddle-e-i, fee-fi-fiddle-e-i  
Fee-f i-f iddle-e- I -o  
He plays it sweet an' hot, he'll stunn you on the spot  
Mister Fiddle with the bow  
  
And with his ol' violin stuck under his chin  
At the barndance hi-de-ho  
Folks gettin' near him, they all wanna hear him  
He's mister Fiddle with the bow  
  
Now me and uncle Andy, we think he's a dandy  
We like to see him dangle the bow  
If you haven't seen or heard it  
You can believe every word of it  
He's mister fiddle with the bow
