You're home again, I'm glad you kept the key  
Been waiting here, it seemed a million years to me  
But hush now I know you're all cried out  
It's all right inside, I've had no doubt  
About your love for me  
I can see behind the tears  
I'm certain of the way we feel  
And given time the hurt will heal  
  
I need you, I think I always will  
From time to time you play around  
But I love you still  
You tried them all, at everybody's beck and call  
Maybe you resist them all  
When I tell you how I missed you  
  
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything  
You can't help the things you do  
  
Home again so won't you close the door  
Stay here with me and  
We'll forget what's gone before  
Just hold me tight  
Our love is gonna make it right  
Put shadows way beyond recall  
The ghost has almost gone  
  
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything  
You can't help the things you do
