Stories from the deepest part of my heart  
Delving under, cause to wonder  
Why am I falling apart?  
  
Scattered all around this topsy-turvy room  
Will I find the one who takes me there too soon?  
  
When the night is cold and you can't find anything  
And your will to survive's at an all-time low  
The spirit will fly and return with a new-found energy  
So keep it within and delight as your garden grows  
  
Whispered in some lonesome voice, too afraid to come out of the dark  
Sinking down into the covers  
Sleep to the beat of your heart  
  
Spinning all around this most peculiar room  
Will I find the one who takes me there too soon?  
  
Do be kind and civilized and don't descend into the dark abyss  
  
When the night is cold and you can't find anything  
And your will to survive's at an all-time low  
The spirit will fly and return with a new-found energy  
So keep it within and delight as your garden grows  
  
Do be kind and civilized and don't descend into the dark abyss  
  
When the night is cold and you can't find anything  
And your will to survive's at an all-time low  
The spirit will fly and return with a new-found energy  
So keep it within and delight as your garden grows  
  
And the man up in the moon is shining  
Good fortune down on me  
And the man up in the moon is shining  
Sweet love  
Sweet love
