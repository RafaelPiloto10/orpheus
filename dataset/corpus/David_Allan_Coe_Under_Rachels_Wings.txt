Will you hurt me more than the pain of sharing her  
With other lovers believers or deceivers  
Well the answer can't be found when I'm alone  
So Rachel take me home and make me feel like a man  
  
I know I swore that I'd be faithful  
But Rachel made me realize that happiness is something you can't share  
With Tom Dick or Harry the reason we got married  
Was to know when you were needed you'd be there  
  
So now you know all about her  
Now you want to act like she's the reason you've been staying out at night  
But honey I've been drinking and lately I've been thinking  
The way that we've been lovin' just ain't right  
Will you hurt me more...  
  
And the man you feel I ain't half as real as the man I used to be  
They've took my pride and I had to fight to keep my sanity  
  
Under Rachel's wings (under Rachel's wings)  
Under Rachel's wings (under Rachel's wings)  
Under Rachel's wings (under Rachel's wings)
