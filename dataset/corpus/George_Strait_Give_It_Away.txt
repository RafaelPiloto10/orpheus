She was stormin' through the house that day  
And I could tell she was leavin'  
And I thought, 'aw, she'll be back.'  
Until we turned around and pointed at the wall and said  
  
That picture from out honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
Just give it away  
She said give it away  
  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where so much love was made  
Just give it away  
She said just give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give it away  
There ain't nothing in this house worth fightin' over  
Oh, we're both tired of fightin' anyway  
Just give it away  
  
Oh, I tried to move on  
But I found that each woman I held  
Just reminded me of that day  
  
When that front door swung wide open  
She flung her diamond ring  
Said, give it away  
Just give it away  
  
And I said, now honey  
Don't you even want your half of everything  
She said give it away  
Just give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So, I'm still right here where she left me  
Along with all the other things that she don't care about anymore  
Hmm  
  
Like that picture from our honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where all our love was made  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
  
I've got furnished house  
A diamond ring  
And a lonely, broken heart  
Full of love  
And I can't even give it away
