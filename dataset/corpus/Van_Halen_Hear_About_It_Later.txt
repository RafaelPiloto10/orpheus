Ain't got no money, got no house on the hill  
Tell me, honey, will your lovin' pay my bills?  
Neighbors gettin' crazy 'bout the noise next door  
It's a major violation, carried away for sure  
See, I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all  
I want a run for my money, that's all  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
Yeah, I'm walking, don't need no ride  
No explanation, just wasting time, yeah  
I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all  
I want a run for my money, that's all  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
You can try me at home, if it feels all right  
But I ain't home at night  
You can try me at home, if it feels all right  
But I ain't home at night  
I don't want to, I'll do what I please  
I don't want to, I'll maybe do a look 'n move  
Yeah, don't look at me baby  
Yes, I better take my chances  
I, I been dreaming 'bout tomorrow  
I don't, I don't, I don't  
I don't want to hear about that, no
