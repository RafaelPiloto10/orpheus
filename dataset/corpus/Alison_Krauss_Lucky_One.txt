You're the lucky one so I've been told  
As free as the wind blowing down the road  
Loved by many, hated by none  
I'd say you were lucky 'cause  
You know what you've done  
Not a care in the world, not a worry in sight  
Everything is gonna be alright 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
You're the lucky one always having fun  
A jack of all trades, a master of none  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why, when, where or how  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why when where or how  
No matter where you're at it's where you'll be  
You can bet you're luck won't follow me  
Just give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one
