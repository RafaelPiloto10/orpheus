Up here in my tree yeah...  
Newspapers meant enough to me yeah...no...  
No more crowbars to my head yeah...  
I'm trading stories with the leaves instead yeah...  
Wave to all my friends yeah...  
They don't seem to notice me no...  
All their eyes trained on the street yo oh...  
Sidewalk cigarettes and scenes yeah...yeah...  
Up here so high I start to escape  
Up here so high the sky I scrape  
I'm so high I hold just one breath here within my chest  
Just like innocence...  
I remember him, yeah...  
I swore I knew everything, oh yeah...  
They say knowledge is a dream, yeah...  
He's growing up just like me, yeah...  
I'm so light, the wind he shakes  
I'm so high, the sky I scrape, yeah...  
I'm so light I hold just one breath and go back to my nest  
Sleep with innocence...  
Up here so high, the bars they break...  
Up here so high, the sky I scrape...  
Had my eyes peeled both wide open, and I got a glimpse...  
Of my innocence...got back my innocence...  
Baby, got it...still got it...
