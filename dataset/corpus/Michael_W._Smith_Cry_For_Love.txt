My life is like a racing car hurtling towards the wall  
At the speed of sound  
My time has been so finely tuned  
But I've never seen a human being so tightly wound  
At times it seems beyond belief  
I just need a bit of relief  
Like a war-weary soldier  
Marching up and over the edge  
Take my hand and pull me up cause I'm falling too fast  
Somehow I've lost my way - I'm cryin' save me  
  
Chorus  
Can you hear me...I'm calling out  
I'm crying out...a cry for love  
I can feel you...you're touching me  
You healing me...my cry for love  
  
I will be the first to admit  
I don't have the strength to handle it alone anymore  
I don't have to fret, don't have to explain  
All my worrying's in vain  
I'm not alone anymore  
  
Why is this so hard to believe  
What is mine is mine to freely receive  
Like the changing of seasons  
This is the beauty of the word  
And for all that I have seen and heard  
Oh I want to come home  
Somehow I'll make my way - my way home to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
Oh Father hear my call (Oh Father hear my call)  
I know you'll catch me when I fall  
Oh Father hear my call  
I know you'll catch me when I fall  
Oh I pray that you'll hold me now  
Hold me  
And take my fear away  
  
I'm cryin' save me  
Oh I know that you can hear me  
Hear me crying out for love  
Oh I know that you can feel my cry for love...ooh...  
  
I can feel you - you're calling out  
You're crying out - a cry for love  
I can feel you - you're touching me  
You're healing me - my cry for love
