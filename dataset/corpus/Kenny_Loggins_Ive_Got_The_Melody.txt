You've got the music in your heart,  
I know just how to make it start.  
You know the song that makes me sing,  
You know the tune, so play my strings.  
  
'cause I've got the melody deep in my heart,  
I could sing it alone, but I'd rather not.  
You've got the harmony deep in your soul,  
If we sing it together, our love will hold.  
  
It sounds just like a symphony,  
Something composed by you and me.  
I hear the music that we make,  
The sound of love is what it takes.  
  
To coax out a melody straight from our hearts,  
Let us sing it together, don't ever stop.  
Let's add the harmony straight from our souls,  
'cause if we sing together now,  
We sing together now,  
We sing, we sing.
