In a city of the future  
It is difficult to concentrate  
Meet the boss, meet the wife  
Everybody's happy  
Everyone is made for life  
  
In a city of the future  
It is difficult to find a space  
I'm too busy to see you  
You're too busy to wait  
  
But I'm okay, how are you?  
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking  
But I'm okay, how are you?  
I hope you're okay too  
  
Everyone one of those days  
When the sky's California blue  
With a beautiful bombshell  
I throw myself into my work  
I'm too lazy, I've been kidding myself for so long  
  
I'm okay, how are you?  
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking  
But I'm okay, how are you?  
I hope you're okay too
