[spoken]  
Yeah he, ho my name is Jimmy beep beereep beeb beeb  
Whatever you want to call me  
You know like the birds fly in the air  
That's how I want to be  
Free, free, free  
I've been trying all my life to break free  
It's like a big bad fight that never ends  
You know what I'm saying  
First I was a soldier  
Then I was a rebel  
Then a runaway, and I've been running ever since  
But it's like everything is in my way,  
Everything, even my head, my body  
[sung]  
A drop in the sea caused a flood  
Quenching man's drought  
You did it to me, to my thirsty heart  
With your tender touch  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah like a drop in the sea, that's how I feel sometimes  
Like I'm stuck in the traffic or something  
But I wasn't gonna let that be  
I made a plan  
I worked hard, I had a tv, I had a car, I had a house  
I was a man with a job, you know  
You know I had all those things  
But then I broke down one day  
And I lost it all  
I came rolling down that mountain  
[sung]  
A pencil in the hands of almighty love  
Where the ink won't dry  
Is writing the names of poor men dying  
In his angel's arms  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze  
[spoken]  
Yeah I lost it all, and like magic I was free  
When no one spoke to me  
When no one cared for me  
That's the day I started singing this song  
And this is how it goes:  
[sung]  
Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul  
Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul, Carry my soul  
Carry my soul  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
[spoken]  
Yeah! That's the song of the free  
I don't want to fight no more  
I feel we where made for something big  
Just let the wind blow  
[sung]  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
You did it to me  
My thirsty hearth  
[spoken]  
Yeah, just let the wind blow  
[sung]  
Nena Nena Nena Tereze...  
Blessed are the poor  
Oh Almighty Love
