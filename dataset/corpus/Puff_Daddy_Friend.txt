Aha, yeah, yeah  
In a world of, larger moves, new cars to cruise  
Sometimes I make the news, falsely accused  
I gotta shake the spot when the stakes is high  
A brother needs space like a vacant lot  
I'm lookin forward to the future, Mase and The Lox  
And my little son Justin, touchin a knot  
You knew I was comin for the crowns that's uptown  
You knew I was comin to put it down so what now?  
It's the Bad Boy, pull up and break the clutch down  
In the five-speed, smirkin then pull up at high speed  
Can you enterprise and rise like cream do?  
And leave em talk about the last time they seen you?  
Game is magnet, to everything platinum with my  
Name attached, can you all do that?  
Think one thing when you read my name  
That Puff nigga, the game'll never be the same  
  
Chorus: Puff Daddy singing  
  
What do you do when they  
Love you? (Let's) "live your life"  
What do you do when the  
Love turns cold? (Let's) "live your life"  
Do you love me baby  
I'll be your friend  
Do you love me baby  
Though I love you like a brother  
  
I would rather be your lover  
  
Verse Two: Foxy Brown  
  
Erybody wanna be Pam Grier now, stare now  
Wanna know what I wear now, peep the gear now, uhh  
I swear now, I done killed that shit  
Dangerous Na Na, niggaz feel my shit, uhh  
Roll for delf, niggaz steal my shit sells  
Dunn tripped on Gortex to Pelly Pel  
You're fuckin with Mel, I have 500 to sell  
Convertible shit, leavin bitches real sick  
Heard he liked to trick nonstop, floss a lot  
Ballers out of town, spots in Adobe cot

Since eight-nine nigga been pushin, plenty drops  
Nigga keyed up, stash for real

Hundred thirty pounds of raw shit, the flaw shit

Get your wig, split the fuck up, nigga lust  
Dangerous, when three general niggaz bust  
Infa-wear, but I sips Dom Pierre  
Floss through the ave all them hoes wanna stare  
Oh yeah? I'm up in your life, play you trife

Chorus  
  
Verse Three: Puff Daddy  
  
Can you feel me baby? I been away a long time  
Is it still me baby? The one on your mind  
Can we creep when everybody sleepin and find  
Ourselves 'tween satin sheets intertwined  
Can I touch you baby? Is that aight witchu?  
Can I love you baby? What we about to do  
Could make the whole earth move, I tell you my first move  
Climb up in it slow, I ain't tryin to hurt you  
Can you feel me baby? Should I keep it right there?  
Is it still me baby? Take off your night wear  
And lay your pretty body in the middle of your bed  
As I place myself in the middle of your legs  
Do you want me baby? Just let me know  
Like Aaliyah baby, and I'ma set you slow  
Get freaky baby, can you handle that?  
Dim the lights burn candles on your back, yeah
