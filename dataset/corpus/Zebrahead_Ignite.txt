Drop in, hey  
  
Call us degenerate, heads in a purple haze  
Breaking our necks with crime that pays  
It's the war of Rolex versus renegades  
So place your bets and burn the beds you made  
  
You know we're never bending or breaking, forsaking anything  
Bonded together we can share in the pain  
And we can feel it, believe it, timing is everything  
And this time we're going out with a bang  
  
Right now, I can feel the world is spinning  
Right now, fight for a new beginning  
Right now, ignite and light the shape of the world you're living  
And I'm sticking with the fuse so tight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
We fight the eminent threat like a macrophage  
Blood tears and sweat with a war we wage  
If we can't get the key we'll break the cage  
Bleed for liberty and get machines to rage  
  
You know we're never fearing or faking, braking for anyone  
We come together, yeah we're just having fun  
And we can feel it, believe it and there goes the neighborhood  
And this time I think you're misunderstood  
  
Right now, I can feel the world is spinning  
Right now, fight for a new beginning  
Right now, ignite and light the shape of the world you're living  
And I'm sticking with the fuse so tight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
We've been dreaming it, bleeding it, believing what they say  
While they're killing it, leaving it and lying all the way  
Heard the counterfeit syndicate is growing everyday  
But we're over it, today we're gonna light the way  
  
Ignite, light it up, ignite, light it up  
Ignite, light it up, ignite tonight, ignite tonight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide
