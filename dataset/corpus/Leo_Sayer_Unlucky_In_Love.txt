The rain is falling through the window  
Down the walls on the floor  
I'm sitting in a station and I'm wondering  
Ooh can it rain any more  
When you're so far down  
There's no getting up again  
Oh I'm so alone  
And I'm to blame  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in love  
Guess it always ends up that way  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in my life  
Guess it'll always be the same  
I'm the only one to blame  
Why oh why am I unlucky in love  
The train is standing on the platform  
But my feet are stuck to the floor  
Maybe in another town I'll get lucky  
Yeah if I could reach that carriage door  
But when you're so far down  
Ain't no getting up again  
Oh I'm so alone  
And I'm to blame  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in love  
Everything I touch turns to dust  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in love  
Never needed anything quite as much  
A woman's voice and a woman's touch  
Why oh why am I unlucky in love
