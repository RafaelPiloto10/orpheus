Twenty four hours of every day  
I'd walk on glass just to hear you say  
Gettin' it on is like a drug to me  
I want you baby, can't you see  
I'm crashed and I'm crushed and I'm stuck on you  
I'd do anything that you want me to  
I'd crawl on my knees just to get to you  
I close my eyes and girl it's true  
  
On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past ninety nine  
Come on, be my  
  
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious  
21st century, you got solar fire  
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer  
21st century sha la la la girl  
  
Kiss this, you're blowin' my mind  
Never say never, but I'm takin' my time  
Girl to the world from the A to the Z  
I fall for you so easily  
Catch my breath cause I know too well  
That I just can't control myself  
Realize we synchronize  
It's only when i close my eyes  
  
On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past 99  
Come on, be my  
  
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious  
21st century, you got solar fire  
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer  
21st century, she's high on flying  
  
Flying, flying  
You take me up, you set me free  
No time to breathe, just zero G  
High, still flying, no gravity  
She's flying  
  
On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past ninety nine  
Come on, be my  
  
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious  
21st century, you got solar fire  
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer  
21st century, high on flying  
21st century, sha la la la girl  
She's a 21st century, sha la la la girl  
21st century, sha la la la girl  
She's a 21st century sha la la la girl
