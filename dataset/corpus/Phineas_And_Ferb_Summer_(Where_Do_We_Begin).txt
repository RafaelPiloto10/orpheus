[Verse 1]  
Phineas: Summer is runnin' through the sprinklers in your T-shirt, shoes and
jeans  
Rolling down a grassy hill, yeah, that's what summer means to me  
It's true  
There's so much more to do  
  
Phineas: The days are longer  
The nights are shorter  
The sun is shining  
Ferb: It's noticeably warmer  
  
[Chorus]  
Phineas: Summer, every single moment is worth it's weight in gold  
Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told  
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Summer is ponds and pools and garden hoses, tryin' to beat the heat  
Summer, bicycles and roller skates and even just bare feet  
It's also... Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots  
Or locating Frankenstein's brain  
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent  
Or driving our sister insane...  
Oh, wait. Maybe we're going too fast.  
  
Summer, it's crickets and cicadas and a glass of lemonade  
Summer, it's sitting with your brother in the backyard under the shade of a  
Big tree  
That's what it means to me  
  
The days are longer  
Phineas and 2nd Dimension Phineas: The nights are shorter  
The sun is shining  
2nd Dimension Ferb: It's noticeably warmer  
  
Phineas: Summer, every single moment is worth it's weight in gold  
Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told  
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
  
Summer  
Where do we begin?  
Summer  
Where do we begin?
