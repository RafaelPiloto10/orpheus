Ships are moving closer to the shoreline  
And we're laughing in the face of loaded guns  
I saw it on the news, we ain't got no worry  
But it won't be in the paper when D Day comes  
  
Lord, Have Mercy  
For we know not what we do  
Have Mercy  
We've forgotten to be afraid of you  
  
Who can solve the problems of a nation  
We cure the symptoms but we're killed by the disease  
I feel I've more than made my contribution  
But I hope there's room in heaven for my ego and me  
  
Lord, Have Mercy  
For we know not what we do  
Have Mercy  
We've forgotten to be afraid of you  
Have Mercy  
Lend us your hand  
Lord, Have Mercy  
Give us just another chance  
  
Too many coaches on the sideline  
Too many keepers in the zoo  
How will we know we've passed the deadline  
Give us the strength to stand or fall  
God in heaven, Have Mercy on us all  
  
The ships are even closer to the shoreline  
Now we're playing in a madman's house of fun  
I read it in the news we ain't got no worry  
But it won't be in the paper when D Day comes  
  
Lord, Have mercy
