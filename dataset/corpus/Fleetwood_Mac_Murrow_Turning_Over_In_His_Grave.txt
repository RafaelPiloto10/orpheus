All the saints and sinners  
They pay handsomely  
MSCAE they make the weapons  
And they run the prisons  
And they sell the justice  
'Cause being guilty is just good business  
Well, we're standing on the borderline  
Ain't no one here going to stop it now  
  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild  
  
Half-closed eyes and unconscious death  
Do you feel the ooze as your brain drains out  
From the pneumatic drills and sharpened knives?  
Blood in the sky, are you dead or alive?  
All the restless people and the bitter green  
Well, it takes this gold, make the spirit mean  
  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild
