[Verse:]  
Weezy bad  
Na really I'm good  
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood  
And a loaded tech live under my seat  
Put ya in the ground  
Now you live under my feet  
All white diamonds on the front of my teeth  
And you better put the O in front of my G  
The bullshit they talkin doesn't come to my knee  
I'm like a linebacker don't run it by me  
My two best friends will accompany me  
And right now they are in my dungarees sleep  
One name Mack one name Nina  
They hit ya make ya do the macarena  
Where ya tools  
You gonna need like a motherfucker  
And I'm so New Orleans it's like a motherfucker  
It's young money and we eattin get ya own supper  
Make me go off to the trunk and get da bonecrusher  
  
Techs ak's, I leave the scene ugly  
Chest head face - arm leg stomach  
I neva been afraid I aint scared of nothin  
Because I got my thang my thang my thang  
And that bitch go boom  
Boom [6x]  
You hear them guns like boom  
Boom [6x]  
Yeah  
They like the way I ball they call me hot sauce  
They no I keep that toaster you can be my pop-tart  
I neva had height but boy I got heart  
And I aint gotta speak I just let my car talk  
I got more clips than any movie you saw  
I pull up on ya like I need some grey poupon  
Hard hat no but I got tha tool on  
And you should be my paper if ever tha tool drawn  
Yeah  
Flow retarded when I spit I get my drool on  
I don't rap I just shit like newborn  
I don't write I just spit like a tooth gone  
So tell them haters cut it out like a coupon  
How come that chopper sound like a new bomb  
Little nigga gotta hold da bitch wit two arms  
I got dat heat tha fire and tha luke-worm  
I'm on ya heal like a shoe horn  
  
Techs ak's, I leave the seat ugly  
Chest head face - arm leg stomach  
I neva been afraid I aint scared of nothin  
Because I got my thang my thang my thang  
And that bitch go boom  
Boom [6x]  
You hear them girls like boom  
Boom [6x]
