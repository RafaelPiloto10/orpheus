Hush now, don't explain  
Just say you'll remain  
Unless you're mad, don't explain  
  
My love, don't explain  
What is there to gain?  
Skip that lipstick  
Don't explain  
  
You know that I love you  
And what loving does  
All my thoughts are real  
For I'm so completely yours  
  
Try to hear folks chatter  
And I know you cheat  
Right or wrong, don't matter  
When you're with me, sweet  
  
Hush now, don't explain  
You're my love and pain  
My life's your love  
Don't explain
