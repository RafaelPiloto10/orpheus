Last year at Lady Mary's fair when I was in Dundee  
I fell in with an old sweetheart and he being on a spree  
His company I did accept and with him I did go  
But to my sad misfortune it proved my poor 'through  
We wandered east we wandered west we wandered through the lawn  
He said he'd see me home that night but home I never saw  
He kept beside me all the while resolved to have his will  
And by and by we lost our way, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
For when we got to Rare's Hill, the laddie said to me  
We can't go home tonight my dear, it's far to late you'll see  
But the night is warm and in my bush, I've got another drill  
And we can lie down here, content, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
For then he poured a nipper piece to quiet all alarm  
When I awoke in the morning we were locked in each other's arms  
He handed me the bottle, another glass to fill  
And I drank his heath, in store o'wealth, at the back of Rare's Hill  
  
And then the lad he said to me, "Oh lassie do not mourn"  
"For while I draw the breath of life from you I'll never harm"  
"If you will come to yonder town, my wedded wife you'll be"  
"we'll be the happiest couple t'was ever in Dundee"  
  
So it's may I never prosper, and may I never thrive  
In anything I take in hand as long as I'm alive  
If e'er I say I rue the day, my laddie had his will  
Success to Lady Mary's fair, and the back of Rare's Hill.
