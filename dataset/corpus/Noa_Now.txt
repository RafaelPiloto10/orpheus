Now  
There is light coming in  
Through the crack in the door  
  
Now  
There is hope  
Where i' d never expect it before  
  
Now  
There are so many things  
But there' s nothing at all  
  
Now  
You are learning to stand  
I am learning to fall.  
  
Now  
As the air in the night  
Becomes cooler and sweet  
  
Now  
I get up seven times  
Just to cover his feet  
  
Now  
There is pain  
But i' ve packed it away for next year  
  
Now  
There is newness and grace and for now,  
There' s no fear.  
  
Then  
I can hardly remember what then used to be  
  
Then  
There was someone I knew  
Looked exactly like me  
  
I was running and running  
With so much to boast  
  
And I had no idea  
What matters the most  
  
Now  
As the air in the night  
Becomes cooler and sweet  
  
Now  
I get up seven times  
Just to cover his feet  
  
Now  
There is pain  
But i' ve packed it away for next year  
  
Now  
There is newness and grace and for now,  
There' s no fear.  
  
Later  
When all of this has turned to songs  
And faded pics  
  
Later  
When colored wooden blocks  
Turn into heavy bricks  
  
Later  
When you will greet me only  
With the shyest smile  
  
Who knows what later brings?  
And so meanwhile..  
  
Now  
There is light coming in  
Through the crack in the door  
  
Now  
There is hope  
Where i' d never expect it before  
  
Now  
There are so many things  
But there' s nothing at all  
  
Now  
You are learning to stand  
I am learning to fall.
