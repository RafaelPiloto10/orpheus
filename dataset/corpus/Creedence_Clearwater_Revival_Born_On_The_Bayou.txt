Now when I was just a little boy standin' to my Daddy's knee  
My Poppa said son don't let the man get you do what he done to me  
'Cause he'll get you 'cause he'll get you now now.  
  
I can remember the fourth of July runnin' through the backwood bare.  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin' chasin' down a hoodoo there  
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.  
  
[Chorus]  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou.  
  
Wish I was back on the bayou rollin' with some Cajun Queen.  
Wishin' I were a freight train, oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can remember the fourth of July, runnin' through the backwood bare.  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin', chasin' down a hoodoo there,  
Chasin' down a hoodoo there.  
  
[Chorus]
