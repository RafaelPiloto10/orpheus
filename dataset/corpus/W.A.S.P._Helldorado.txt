I hear the motor running  
Burning up the road  
Tail-pipes-a-draggin'  
Fire in the smoke  
And I say "Hell yeah!!"  
I say "Hell yeah!!"  
Ooh she's a monster  
Take me on home  
This ain't no joyride  
Do you wanna go?  
This ain't your Daddy's Oldsmobile, no!  
I hear the beast a-coming  
To get another load  
Of fire and brimstone  
Do you wanna go?  
And I say - Hell yeah!!  
I say - Hell yeah!!  
Ooh it's a monster  
Rolling me (on) home  
This ain't no joyride  
No, no oh  
Do we get a driver?  
You bet your ass we do!  
  
Tonight - It's all over now  
Ooh, Hell's just one mile down the road  
Goodbye - it's all over now (so long)  
My Helldorado's goin home  
  
Take me to Hell  
Cause I'm going there  
Hot rods to Hell  
Helldorado  
Take me to Hell  
I'm going where  
The Devil's there  
In Helldorado
