She was frigid like a Bible  
When she met her boyfriend Michael  
He took her in his Zephyr  
They sat like salt and pepper  
Looking out across the city  
From Lover's Leap is pretty  
The lights they flick and flutter  
He told her how he loved her  
Next night he called for her  
But Dad protected daughter  
And told him she was poorly  
A lie was told there surely  
So Michael felt rejected  
This wasn't quite expected  
He drove off to his local  
Where he felt anti-social  
  
She cried all night at missing  
The boy she could be kissing  
While he was falling over  
He drunk himself back sober  
And went home in a taxi  
And crashed out in the back seat  
He slept just like a baby  
Which he hadn't done just lately  
He saw her in the morning  
Out with his sister Pauline  
She felt all shy and soppy  
He acted cool and cocky  
He said tonight at Charlie's  
There's going to be a party  
I'll meet you at half seven  
She visualized the heaven  
  
If you ever change your mind  
Which you do from time to time  
Never chew a pickle  
With a little slap and tickle  
You have to throw the stone  
To get the pool to ripple  
  
That night they danced together  
It looked like love forever  
He put his hand on her leg  
You should have heard what she said  
He tried again much later  
It seemed to aggravate her  
He drove home in silence  
Avoiding all violence  
She said let's watch the city  
From Lover's Leap is pretty  
I think I need the fresh air  
She put a comb through her hair  
Then while she turned to kiss him  
And very nearly missed him  
She put her hand on his leg  
He felt her tongue in his head  
  
If you ever change your mind  
Which you do from time to time  
Never chew a pickle  
With a little slap and tickle  
You have to throw the stone  
To get the pool to ripple
