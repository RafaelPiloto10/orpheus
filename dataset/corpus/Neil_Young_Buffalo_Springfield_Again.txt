Used to play in a rock 'n roll band,  
But they broke up  
We were young and we were wild  
It ate us up  
Now I'm not saying who was right or wrong  
  
Looking out on a big green lawn,  
Girls and boys  
Playing in the afternoon sun,  
And life's a joy  
I heard an old song playing on a radio  
  
Buffalo Springfield again  
  
Like to see those guys again  
And give it a shot  
Maybe now we can show the world  
What we got  
But I'd just like to play for the fun we had  
  
Buffalo Springfield again  
  
Buffalo Springfield again
