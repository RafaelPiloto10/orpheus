I hope you notice how I feel,  
Girl, I ain't running 'gain  
But there's a couple things I like, I try to explain  
You say you wanna wait a while  
  
Girl, I ain't mad at you, In fact I like your style  
'Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling  
It's real, ooooh and maybe here's the deal  
I'll be right here  
  
And the sun and the moon and the stars  
They all refuse to shine  
I'll be right here  
I wanna be the thought that you think whatever is on your mind  
I'll be right here  
Girl I wanna be a part of you just like the air you breathe  
And you can count on me  
  
You don't have to be afraid to say what's on your mind  
Your body language tellin me, let's take our time  
You say you wanna play the wild
