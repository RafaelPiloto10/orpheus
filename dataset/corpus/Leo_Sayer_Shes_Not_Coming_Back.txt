Monday morning nine A.M.  
I missed my bus I must've overslept again  
Phoned up work told 'em I can't go on  
Since she left, this house is not a home I know  
  
She's not coming back  
She's not coming back  
She's not coming back  
She's not coming back  
  
All my friends they keep coming around  
Well they can dress me up but I won't paint the town  
No-one else'll do the things she'd do  
All my fun is up because I know this time for sure  
She's not coming back  
  
Didn't have a reason  
Had to be free  
Told me she was leaving  
  
She's not coming back to me  
Monday evenings used to be so easy rolling  
Staying home with her  
Now this room is like a prison  
  
Can't go nowhere, I'm nothing without her  
She's not coming back  
No she's not coming back  
Oh she's not coming back - no more  
No more, no more  
  
Tuesday morning and it's not that bad  
Well I'm smiling now, thinking of all the fun we had  
And if I see her, this is what I will say  
"Well thanks for asking but as you see, I'm OK"  
She's not coming back  
  
Didn't have a reason  
Had to be free  
Told me she was leaving  
  
She's not coming back  
Oh she's not coming back  
No she's not coming back  
No she's not coming back  
No she's not coming back, to me  
  
Didn't have a reason  
She wanted to be free  
She told me she was leaving  
She was leaving me
