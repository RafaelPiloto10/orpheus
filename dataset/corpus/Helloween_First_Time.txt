Will your first time  
Will it be  
I think of someone like me?  
Makes me wonder  
I can show you things  
You'd never thought you'd see  
You're like sunshine  
I can feel your heat is drying out my brain  
Would you feel like  
Like we're having fun if I can do the rain?  
Have you thought of your dreams  
Do you have some?  
Let's see if we can find some more  
Give me your fancies at random  
I think we can deal with 'em all  
I can't wait forever  
Baby open me your door  
I just want your loving  
If you cannot give me more  
I can see you standing there  
You know you're worth the try  
Let me guide you in my spaceship  
And I'll surely make you  
Have a real good time  
Don't waste time now  
You are soakin' wet so fix  
The things you got  
Guess you know how  
And when you're done  
I gotta see you strut  
My desire  
Can I watch you rock and  
Know which one to choose?  
I'm no liar  
I could take you down  
And you got nothing to lose  
I don't know any better occasion  
Can't hold back, it's the end of the day  
I don't think you're here for the first time  
No problem with me anyway  
I can't wait forever  
Baby open me your door  
I just want your loving  
If you cannot give me more  
I can see you standing there  
I know we have a try  
I can feel this night is special  
And I surely make  
You have a real good time  
I can't leave you standing there  
You know we have a try  
I can feel this night is special  
And I'll surely make  
you have a real good time
