I've told you once and I've told you twice  
Wait for that day, when our love will rise  
To that song that brought our hearts together.  
  
Even though you're mistreating me  
I know the girl that you used to be  
For me those days were meant to last forever.  
  
Time after time I'm wondering why  
Am I to be all alone  
Day after day I pray that you'll stay  
Cause you've got a heart of stone.  
  
I walk the streets like a broken man  
Oh I wish that you would understand  
Even though you're still the one I wait for.  
  
I guess in love there's no guarantee  
Sometimes it's not what it seems to be  
Even though you're still the one I care for.
