Everytime you move  
There's a spark that seems to find its' way  
To everything I own  
I am losing in your favorite way  
'cause you move me, yeah you move me  
And you move me  
And you move, you move, you move, you move  
You are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
The secrets that we share  
Aren't always so important that we  
Have to disagree  
About lots of things we used to do  
'cause you move me, yeah you move me  
And you move me  
And you move, you move, you move, you move  
You are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
Hey there switch your mind of  
And untie me  
You move me 'round the day  
For a while  
I'm not lost, I am saved now  
You untied me  
You move me 'round the day  
Everytime I come  
There's a spark that seems to find its' way  
To everything I own  
I am loosing in a favorite way  
'cause you move me, yeah you move me  
And you move me  
And you move, you move, you move, you move  
You are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
Yeah you are everything I have  
You are everything I have  
Hey there switch your mind of  
And untie me  
You move me 'round the day  
For a while  
I'm not lost, I am saved now  
You untied me  
You move me 'round the day  
For a while I thought you liked me....
