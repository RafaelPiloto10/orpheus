You've got me wide open,  
Wide open, now I'm yours  
You found me heartbroken  
Heartbroken, on the floor  
Became my salvation  
Salvation through the war, yeah  
You got me wide open  
Wide open, now I'm sure  
  
In a world like this where some back down  
I, I, know we're gonna make it  
In a time like this where love comes 'round  
I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you  
  
And now I'm free falling,  
Free falling, in your eyes  
You got me still calling,  
Still calling, no surprise  
I never knew I could love 'til the  
End of time, yeah  
And now I'm free falling,  
Free falling by your side  
  
In a world like this where some back down  
I, I, know we're gonna make it  
In a time like this where love comes 'round  
I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you  
  
Yeah  
In a world like this  
  
You got me wide open,  
Wide open, yeah  
And now I'm free falling  
Free falling  
  
Hey, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah  
In a world like  
In a world like 'cause I got you  
In a world like this
