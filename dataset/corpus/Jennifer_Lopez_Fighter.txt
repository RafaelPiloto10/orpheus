Well I thought you knew, thinkin' that you were true  
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up  
'Cause I've had enough  
You were there by my side, always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames 'cause your creed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and the cheating you'd probably think that  
I hold resentment for you  
But uh, uh you're wrong  
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouln't know  
Just how capable I am yo pull through  
So I wanna say thank you  
'Cause it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for makin' me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for makin' me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're goin round playin, the victim now  
But don't even begin feelin' I'm the one to blame  
'Cause you dug your own grave  
After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me  
But that won't work anymore, no more  
It's over  
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  
'Cause it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through libing in denial  
But in the end you'll see  
You-Wont-Stop-Me  
  
I am a fighter and I  
I ain't goin' stop  
There is no turning back  
I've had enough  
  
[Chorus x2]
