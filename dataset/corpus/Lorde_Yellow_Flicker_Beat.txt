[Verse 1]  
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm  
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold  
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones  
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me  
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire  
And my necklace is of rope, i tie it and untie it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home  
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes  
I'm done with it (ooh)  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the start of how it all ends  
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it  
I'm speeding up and this is the  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
We're at the start, the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars there's so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds  
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now  
People talk to me, and all their faces blur  
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison  
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me  
I'm done with it (ooh)  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the start of how it all ends  
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it  
I'm speeding up and this is the  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
We're at the start, the colors disappear  
I never watch the stars there's so much down here  
So I just try to keep up with them  
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart  
  
[Outro]  
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat  
Sparking up my heart  
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
