I have waited  
Dined on ashes  
Swung from chandeliers and climbed Everest  
And none of it's got me close to this  
  
I've waited all my life  
If not now, when will I?  
  
We've been good  
Even a blast, but  
Don't you feel like something's missing here?  
Don't you dare, ooh, ooh  
  
I've waited all my life  
If not now, when will I?  
Stand up and face the bright light  
Don't hide your eyes  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
  
No umbrellas  
No sunglasses  
Heal and hallelujah everyday  
  
I've waited all my life  
If not now, when will I?  
Stand up and face the bright light  
Don't hide your eyes  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
It's time
