Woke up this morning and I put on my shoes  
Fixed up my hair and then I put on my rouge  
Hopped out my window into your brand new car  
Something's happening between You and I  
Something's going on deep down inside  
  
We're going dancing babe all through the night  
My heart is beating can't be wrong it feels right  
I know for sure that it was love at first sight  
Something's happening between you and I  
Something's going on deep down inside  
  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid  
I wanna touch you, but I'm afraid  
Daddy's gonna get mad  
I don't wanna lose you  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid  
I wanna touch you, but I'm afraid  
Daddy's gonna get mad  
I don't wanna lose you  
  
Last night I dreamed that we were running away  
The same old story and babe the same old game  
But I know honey this time it's not the same  
Something's happening between you and I  
Something's going on deep down inside  
  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid...  
  
I guess I'm too romantic for you babe  
I guess I'm too romantic for you babe  
And I'd sail across the atlantic for you babe  
I'd sail across atlantic for you babe  
  
I wanna kiss you, but I'm afraid...
