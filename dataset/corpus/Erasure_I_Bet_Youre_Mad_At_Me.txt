Don't justify  
For what you are  
And where you've been  
For who you are tonight  
So lonesome tonight  
  
Make believe  
Just hanging on  
You're crazy  
That's who are you tonight  
All over tonight  
  
Tell the world  
You're still afraid  
Been on this road too long  
  
Falling soft  
But raining hard  
So wrap up well  
It's freezing cold tonight  
So cold tonight  
  
Tell me all  
I need to know  
I'll spare your fears  
So sad to see tonight  
The tears you cry tonight  
  
I stayed away  
A long time now  
But I'll be home tonight  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
(Tonight)  
(All over tonight)  
  
Tell the world  
You're still afraid  
Been on this road too long  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me
