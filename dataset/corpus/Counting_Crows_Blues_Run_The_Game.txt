Catch a boat to England baby  
Maybe to Spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues run the game  
Send out for whisky baby  
Send out for gin  
Me and room service honey  
Me and room service mama  
Me and room service, well  
We're living a life of sin  
When I ain't drinking baby  
You are on my mind  
When I ain't sleeping honey  
When I ain't sleeping mama  
When I ain't sleeping, well  
You know you'll find me crying  
Catch a boat to England baby  
Maybe to Spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues run the game  
Living is a gamble baby  
Loving's much the same  
Wherever I have played  
Wherever I throw those dice  
Wherever I have played  
The blues they run the game  
Maybe when I'm older baby  
Somewhere down the line  
I'll wake up older  
So much older mama  
I'll wake up older  
And I'll just stop all my trying  
So catch a boat to England baby  
Maybe to Spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues are all the same
