Yeah I love him like he wants me to and I know how  
And it's my duty to know his moods when he gets moody  
Yeah I give him what he needs and that's why I'm his right now  
Yes I know I love him right cause I know how yeah I know how  
Yes I know how to hold him when he needs holdin'  
And I know how to kiss him when he needs kissin'  
I understand his every wish and his every wish is mine  
Yes he knows I love to love him and I know how yeah I know how  
[ piano ]  
Yes I know how to hold him...  
You better believe I know how
