[Jay R]  
How have you been  
The last time I saw you  
We graduated high school  
I can't believe it's been 2 years since then  
  
[Kyla]  
I've been okay  
Nothing much has changed  
Still doing the same old thing  
  
[Jay R]  
Oh may I take a little bit of your time  
  
[Kyla]  
No, I don't think that would be possible  
  
[Jay R]  
Why do you have a boyfriend  
  
[Kyla]  
No, I broke it off 2 months ago  
  
[Jay R]  
If you don't mind  
I'd like to get your number  
And maybe reminisce together  
Is that alright?  
  
[Kyla]  
I don't mind  
Would love to get together (No doubt)  
In fact tonight I'd rather (Yeah)  
Go back in time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
  
[Jay R]  
Now here we are  
Tell me everything about you  
Where you go the things that you do  
The things you like whatever is on your mind  
  
[Kyla]  
I just bought a house  
Been half way 'round the world  
Still not your ordinary girl  
  
[Jay R]  
I've always have had a little crush on you  
  
[Kyla]  
I can't believe you felt that way too  
  
[Jay R]  
And after all this time I still think I do  
  
[Kyla]  
Boy for now just take me where  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day (Hey)  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Just follow the signs (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (go back in time)  
  
[Jay R]  
Girl I'm glad you came tonight  
  
[Kyla]  
What made you think I'd decline  
  
[Jay R]  
I haven't seen you in a while  
Still have that pretty smile  
  
[Kyla]  
I see you still haven't changed  
Still have your flirty ways  
  
[Jay R]  
Well, I can't help it with you  
You make me wanna go  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Just go back in time  
  
I wanna go back into time  
Now rewind back in the day (Back in the day)  
When nothing really mattered  
Just let go let me take control  
Just follow the signs  
Just follow the signs (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (I wanna go back go back in time)  
Let's go back in time (Just go back go back)  
Let's go back in time
