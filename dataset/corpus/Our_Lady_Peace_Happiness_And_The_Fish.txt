I confess  
Everyone is overweight  
And I'm obsessed  
Talking is just masturbating  
  
Without the mess  
Addiction leaves you sad today  
And unimpressed  
I can't remember all the names  
  
Everyone you meet today  
Is just so fucking vain  
Bored again by happiness  
And all those friends, I've lost in there, I've lost in there  
  
I'm upset  
Happiness is not a fish  
That you can catch  
Imagination can't resist  
  
The laziness  
That pins you down, get on your knees  
Everyone you meet is feeling  
Useless and ashamed  
  
Bored again by happiness  
And all those friends, I've lost in  
  
Everyone you meet is feeling  
Useless and ashamed  
Bored again by happiness  
And all those friends, I've lost in there  
  
But I won't remember  
But I won't forget this  
But I won't forget the love  
  
But I won't remember  
But I won't forget this  
But I already felt the love  
I lost in there
