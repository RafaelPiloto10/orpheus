Why did you do it just tonight?  
You're leaving me without good-bye  
Why can't you give me one more try?  
Before you went and said good-bye  
Why did you do it just tonight?  
  
Sometimes I feel that life's a show  
But I don't wait don't let you go  
'Cause darling, heaven can be cold  
With no angel life been told  
Your memories come and memories go  
But my love will always grow  
Why do you flow away my heart?  
Why did you break apart?  
  
Why did you do it just tonight?  
We had two tickets to paradise  
Nobody ever loved you more  
As I always did before  
Why did you do it just tonight?  
  
The way you talk, the way you smile  
All things you do make life worth while  
It's not a game you play with me  
You give this world some sanity  
Your memories come and memories go  
But my love will always grow  
Look at the stars, they're out tonight  
Be forever by my side
