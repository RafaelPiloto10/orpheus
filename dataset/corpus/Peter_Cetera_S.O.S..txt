Where are those happy days  
They seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you  
But you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice  
Used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me  
Darling can't you hear me  
S.O.S.  
The love you gave me  
Nothing else can save me  
S.O.S.  
  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on  
You seem so far away - though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love  
It used to be so good
