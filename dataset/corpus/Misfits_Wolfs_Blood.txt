You don't know what I've spoken to  
While I've been gone  
Know what I've gotta do and  
You won't kill me  
'Cause of my head  
  
My blood feels wolfs blood  
Pumping in my veins  
When I feel like murdering a baby  
And I feel my heart extend  
And I feel my muscles break  
And I feel my gums extend  
And I know I'm not a man  
And I still don't have my head  
  
My blood, it's wolfs blood  
Pumping in my veins  
When I'm killing a five year old  
And I feel my heart extend  
And I feel my muscles break  
And I feel my gums extend  
And I know I'm not a man, oh  
  
You don't know what I've spoken to  
While I've been gone  
You don't know what I've gotta do and  
You won't kill me  
'Cause of my head  
  
My blood, it's wolfs blood  
Pumping in my veins  
When I'm killing a five year old  
And I'm gonna take him up  
To my house on a hill  
I know why you're dead
