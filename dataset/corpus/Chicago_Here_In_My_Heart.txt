I keep on thinkin' I should be free  
This time just leave it alone  
With 17 reasons not to believe  
Nothin' goes everybody knows like you always want it to be  
  
But, here in my heart  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
And it get's in my way  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart the door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life (oohh oo-oo-ooh)  
  
What I've been feelin' I can't explain  
Lost in the muse of your eyes  
An' I'm fallin' so hard  
Just like the rain  
Comes a time when ya cross the line and you know you got to believe  
  
'Cause here in my heart  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
An' it gets in my way  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart the door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life  
  
I know!  
(That) I may never sleep again  
'Till I see you (ooh oo-oo-ooh)  
Oh, baby, I know (I know!)  
Life is too short and I can't pretend  
It's not about you (not about you)  
Can't do without you  
Wooo oo-oo-ooh  
  
Here in my heart  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
And it get's in my way (gets in my way)  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart (here in my heart)  
The door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life  
There's a dream that's unbroken  
It gets in my way  
But it won't be denied  
Here in my heart (here in my heart)  
The door is still open  
Waiting for you to walk into my life  
In my life (in my life)  
In my life (in my life)
