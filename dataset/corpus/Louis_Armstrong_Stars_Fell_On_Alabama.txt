We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white  
And stars fell on Alabama that night  
I can't forget the glamour, your eyes held a tender light  
And stars fell on Alabama last night  
  
I never planned in my imagination  
A situation so heavenly  
A fairy land that no one else could enter  
And in the center, just you and me, dear  
  
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight  
And stars fell on Alabama last night  
  
I never planned in my imagination  
A situation so heavenly  
A fairy land that no one else could enter  
And in the center, just you and me, dear  
  
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight  
Ah, stars fell on Alabama last night
