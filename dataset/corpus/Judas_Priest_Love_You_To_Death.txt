You get me up, then we both get down  
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds  
I'm all tied up on your bed  
I'd rather be inside your head  
  
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah  
You've hit the spot, give it all you got  
I don't care  
  
I'll teach you a lesson  
That you won't forget  
Why don't you save your breath  
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death  
  
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back  
Then you ease off with your attack  
You're the best I've had if you please  
You never stop, you great big tease  
  
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah  
You've hit the spot, give it all you got  
I don't care  
  
I'll teach you a lesson  
That you won't forget  
Why don't you save your breath  
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death  
  
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go  
And when you turn your love on me  
Baby you're the star of the show  
  
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go  
And when you turn your love on me  
Baby you're the star of the show  
  
I'll teach you a lesson  
That you won't forget  
Why don't you save your breath  
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
