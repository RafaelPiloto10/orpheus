Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Oh, keep your heart for me for someday  
I'll return and you know you're  
The only one I'll ever love.  
  
Too many nights  
Too many stars  
Too many moons to change your mind  
If I'm gone too long don't forget where you belong  
When the stars come out remember you are mine.  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Oh, keep your heart for me for someday  
I'll return and you know you're  
The only one I'll ever love.  
  
Too many miles  
Too many days  
Too many nights to be alone  
So please keep your heart while we're apart  
Don't you linger in the moonlight while I'm gone.  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
The love blooms at night in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Oh, keep your heart for me for someday  
I'll return and you know you're  
The only one I'll ever love.  
  
You're the only one I'll ever love
