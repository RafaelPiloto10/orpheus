Kids - kids, Christmas I-is for kids  
Look around and you will see  
Kids from one to ninety-three  
Laughin', lovin' life and bein' kids  
  
Kids - ki-I-I-ids, Christmas I-is for kids  
Kids like you and little brother  
Aunts and uncles, dads and mothers  
Grandma, grandpa an' all the other kids  
  
Daddy runs the 'lectric train  
While all the children wait in vain  
To take their turn  
At playin' engineer  
  
Grandpa catches grandma's cheek  
And all the family sneaks a peak  
And suddenly  
Their wrinkles disappear  
  
Take a look at Betty Joe  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Pretending that  
She doesn't know it's there  
  
And in the front yard Uncle Mike  
Just fell off brother's brand new bike  
There's Christmas cheer  
And laughter everywhere  
  
Kids (kids) - ki-I-I-ids (kids)  
Christmas I-is for kids  
Christmas time is here again  
And now it's when the fun begins  
This time of year we all turn into kids...
