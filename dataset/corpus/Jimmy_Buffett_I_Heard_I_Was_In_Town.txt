Came to see friends  
Walk old streets again  
Grab a bite and beer by the sea  
It caught my attention  
The old town has grown  
That's why I came alone  
  
But I've been treated well  
I raised all kinds of hell  
When a full tank was only a fin  
Ain't it quite funny how things turn around  
I heard I was in town  
  
I was a madman in a pickup truck  
So many years ago  
Changes have come like the storms of the season  
But time here still moves slow  
Passed the old joints  
My favorite haunts  
Where we'd stay for twelve or ten  
Ain't it quite funny word gets around  
I heard I was in town  
  
I was a madman in a pickup truck  
So many years ago  
Changes have come like the storms of the season  
But time here still moves slow  
  
Came to see friends  
Walk old streets again  
Maybe strike up a tune with the moon  
Don't it seem funny  
Word gets around  
I heard I was in town  
  
SOMEWHERE OVER
