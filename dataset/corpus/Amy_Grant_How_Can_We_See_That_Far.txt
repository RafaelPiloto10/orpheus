We said our promises by candlelight  
You held my hands, I was dressed in white  
We were young  
How can we see that far?  
How can we see that far?  
  
I knew I wanted you like no one else  
I told my momma that I'd found myself  
In your eyes  
How can we see that far?  
How can we see that far?  
  
But like your daddy said  
The same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  
And the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  
And the mighty wind that knocks us down  
If we lean into it  
Will drive our fears away.  
  
And then I woke you in the dead of night  
To hold my hands, push away the fright  
Life had come (how can we see that far?) - a son  
How can we see that far?  
  
Yeah, we were nervous and a little scared  
Until the music of our baby's cry  
Filled the air  
How can we see that far? (How can we see that far?)  
  
But like your daddy said  
The same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  
And the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  
And the mighty wind that knocks us down  
If we lean into it  
Will drive our fears away.  
  
We might die  
We might live  
We could hurt each other badly  
Do things, things so hard to forgive  
Ooh, and if time is not our friend  
Your mind might forget me before the end  
And oh, I cannot  
I cannot look that far.  
  
But like your daddy said  
(How can we see that far?)  
The same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  
And the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  
And the mighty wind that knocks us down  
If we lean into it  
How can we see that far?  
Gotta lean into it  
Will drive our fears away  
  
It's the same sun, yeah  
And the same rain  
It's the same sun  
And the same rain.
