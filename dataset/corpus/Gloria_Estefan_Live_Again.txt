When you turned and walked away  
You said all you had to say  
It was over  
You just couldn't understand  
How deeply I had given all my love to you  
I was left alone in tears  
Our life together had become a memory  
And as far as I can see  
There was darkness  
And I had nothing left inside but pain and sorrow  
I had no plans for my tomorrow  
And I had to find a reason  
That would make me live again  
Live again  
  
Now today  
I feel my life is worth living  
I have someone who is giving  
Someone to share each new day  
Someone who will always stay  
When I think of yesterday  
It all seems so far away  
I'm so happy  
And I feel as my life has just begun  
And that the world is gonna be mine  
It is this feeling deep inside me  
That has made me live again  
Live again  
Live again
