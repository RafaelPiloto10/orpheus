I will answer the wind  
I will leave with the tide  
I'll be out on the road  
Every chance I can ride  
  
No matter how far  
No matter how free  
I'll be alone  
If you'll wait for me  
  
There'll be times when I'll rise  
There'll be times when I'll fall  
There'll be times when it's best to say nothing at all  
  
Knowing you're right  
Letting it be  
I'll be around  
If you'll wait for me  
If you'll wait for me  
  
And I'll fight for the right to go over the hill  
If it'll only mean something to me  
I will not be persuaded  
I won't be still  
I'll find a way to be free  
  
In the cool of the night  
In the heat of the day  
If you're ever in doubt  
I'll be on my way  
Straight to your side  
I guarantee  
I'll be around  
If you'll wait for me  
If you'll wait for me
