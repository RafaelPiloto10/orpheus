Move it move it, baby  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
And I can't stop this rhythm in my heart.  
Move it move it baby,  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
Without this beat my life would fall apart.  
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot,  
Gonna make a lot of money,  
Gonna break your heart.  
Watch out boy, (watch out boy)  
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot,  
Gonna make a lot of money,  
Gonna break your heart.  
  
But I'm the only one with a key.  
And that's me.  
  
Sometimes,  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line,  
A ray of sunshine,  
Sometimes,  
You know today you're gonna have a good time,  
And you're ready to go.  
  
Move it move it baby  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
And I can't keep my rhythm in my heart.  
Move it move it baby,  
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?  
Without this beat my life would fall apart.  
Shuffle to the beat,  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gimme what you got.  
Watch out boy, (watch out boy)  
Suffle to the beat,  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gonna stitch you up.  
  
Any other boy that you see,  
But not me.  
  
Sometimes,  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line,  
A ray of sunshine,  
Sometimes,  
You know today you're gonna have a good time,  
And you're ready to go.  
Turn the music up,  
Turn the music up, turn it up,  
Because it's all i've-  
All that I've got.  
  
Shuffle to the beat  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gimme what you got.  
Watch out boy, (watch out boy)  
Suffle to the beat,  
Gonna take a cut,  
There's money in your feet,  
Gonna stitch you up.  
  
Sometimes,  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line,  
A ray of sunshine,  
Sometimes,  
You know today you're gonna have a good time,  
And you're ready to go.
