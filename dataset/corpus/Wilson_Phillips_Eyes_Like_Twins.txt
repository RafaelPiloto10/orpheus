I recognize that smile  
Our winter was oh so cold  
You wore your mysterious cloak just like a child  
No careless words were said  
We spoke with eyes instead  
We looked into each other like long lost friends  
But then you went away  
And I never heard  
You had a summer haunt  
You said the ice would kill  
But you would not be caught  
  
We have eyes like twins  
Where your last thought ends my next begins always  
Just one heartbeat away  
From everything I mean to say oh  
Catch me I'm falling for you  
Wish for me I'll come running to save you  
Touch me I'm calling for you  
Remember me, I will never betray you  
We have eyes like twins  
  
I slept a thousand hours  
My heart felt cold as a cowards  
You sent a southern breeze like forest fire  
I heard those voices too  
I dreamed each dream with you  
We breathe as one together and shed our tears  
But then I woke with you  
And my dream came true  
I'll never hold you here  
I know when winter comes that you will disappear  
  
We have eyes like twins  
Where your last thought ends my next begins always  
Just one heartbeat away  
From everything I mean to say oh  
Catch me I'm falling for you  
Wish for me I'll come running to save you  
Touch me I'm calling for you  
Remember me, I will never betray you  
We have eyes like twins  
  
I see red, when you're in danger  
And I see blue, when you are crying  
All the pictures I believe  
You are no stranger  
You are no stranger  
  
We have eyes like twins  
Where your last thought ends my next begins always  
Just one heartbeat away  
From everything I mean to say oh  
Catch me I'm falling for you  
Wish for me I'll come running to save you  
Touch me I'm calling for you  
Remember me, I will never betray you  
We have eyes like twins  
  
Catch me I'm falling for you  
Remember me, you are no stranger  
We have eyes like twins  
You are no stranger to me  
Just one heartbeat away
