For years I've lived without a meaning  
I've lost faith in dreams somehow  
I'm so sick and tired of scheming  
I guess it just don't matter now  
All my life I've been a loser  
It seems that fate has made a vow  
That I will never know contentment  
But it just don't matter now  
Yes I knew the day I lost you  
But could not face fact, somehow  
And I knew just what it cost you  
But it just don't matter now  
All my heart has lost a feeling  
That meant more to me than thou  
And I will never say I blame you  
Cause it just don't matter now
