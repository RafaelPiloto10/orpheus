Two am, where do I begin  
Crying off my face again  
The silent sound of loneliness  
Wants to follow me to bed  
  
I'm a ghost of a girl  
That I want to be most  
I'm the shell of a girl  
That I used to know well  
  
Dancing slowly in an empty room  
Can the lonely take the place of you  
I sing myself a quiet lullaby  
Let you go and let the lonely in  
To take my heart again  
  
Too afraid, to go inside  
For the pain of one more loveless night  
For the loneliness will stay with me  
And hold me till I fall asleep  
  
I'm a ghost of a girl  
That I want to be most  
I'm the shell of a girl  
That I used to know well  
  
Dancing slowly in an empty room  
Can the lonely take the place of you  
I sing myself a quiet lullaby  
Let you go and let the lonely in  
To take my heart again  
  
Broken pieces of  
A barely breathing story  
Where there once was love  
Now there's only me  
And the lonely  
  
Dancing slowly in an empty room  
Can the lonely take the place of you  
I sing myself a quiet lullaby  
Let you go and let the lonely in  
To take my heart again
