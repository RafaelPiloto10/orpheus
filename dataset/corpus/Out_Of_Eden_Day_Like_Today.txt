Woke up this morning, jumped out of bed,  
Hit my head on a lampshade and the clock said  
That I'm running late so I'm rushing trying to get on my way  
(huuuh)get to my car and the gauge is on E,  
Get gas and I pay a dollar ninety-three  
Got stopped by the cops cause I was speeding  
Eighty-nine in a fifty-five Lord, why me  
  
On a day like today,  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on, smile on my face  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
On a day like today,  
Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
  
It's days like this there's a lesson learned  
When I get up on the wrong side of the world  
It's easy to dwell on my situation instead of every good thing  
(but I know I've been blessed) I gotta say thank you  
(and though there's stress) I'm still grateful  
(it's just a test) he's more than able to see me through on a day  
  
On a day like today,  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on, smile on my face  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
On a day like today,  
Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
  
I know it wouldn't hurt to smile  
It's not as bad as it could be it will work out in a while (repeat)  
  
On a day like today,  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on, smile on my face  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
On a day like today,  
Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
  
So I just h
