If my heart could only talk  
Heaven would be mine  
If my heart could only talk  
Life would be divine  
You would hear my song of love so tender  
It would thrill you until you willingly surrender  
  
If my heart could only talk  
Dreams would all come true  
'Neath the starlight I would walk  
Hand in hand with you  
I would have to seek your lips  
Thrill you to your fingertips  
If my heart could only talk  
  
If my heart could only talk  
Dreams would all come true  
'Neath the starlight I would walk  
Hand in hand with you  
I would have to seek your lips  
Thrill you to your fingertips  
If my heart could only talk
