I've got my cat in the yard  
And I've got my car in the street  
And I've got my nose to the stone  
What I don't have is you  
'Cause I didn't know  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours  
  
I've got my hole in the wall  
Somewhere I can go when the sky begins to fall  
I've got my candles to burn  
What I don't have is you  
'Cause I didn't learn  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours  
  
I've got my CD's to turn  
I've got my lessons to learn  
And I've got my coat for the road  
What I don't have is you  
'Cause I didn't know  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours
