It's not the way you lead me  
By the hand into the bedroom  
It's not the way you throw your clothes  
Upon the bathroom floor  
  
Been thinking about you  
I just couldn't wait to see  
Fling my arms around you  
As we fall in ecstasy  
  
Ooh sometimes  
The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah  
Ooh sometimes  
It's the broken heart that decides  
  
It's not the way that you caress me  
Toy with my affection  
It's not my sense of emptiness  
You fill with your desire  
  
Climb in bed beside me  
We can lock the world outside  
Touch me, satisfy me  
Warm your body next to mine  
  
Ooh sometimes  
The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah  
Ooh sometimes  
It's the broken heart that decides  
  
Ooh sometimes  
The truth is harder than the pain inside yeah  
Ooh sometimes  
It's the broken heart that decides
