Can you see the real me?  
Can ya?  
Can ya?  
  
I went back to the doctor  
To get another shrink  
I sit and tell him bout my weekend  
But he never betrays what he thinks  
  
Can you see the real me, Doctor?  
Doctor?  
Can you see the real me, Doctor?  
Woah, Doctor!  
  
I went back to my mother  
I said "I'm crazy ma, help me"  
She said "I know how it feels son  
Cause it runs in the family"  
  
Can you see the real me, Mama?  
Mama?  
Can you see the real me, Mama?  
Woah, Mama!  
  
Can you see  
Can you see  
Can you see the real me?  
Can you see  
Can you see the real me  
The real me  
The real me  
  
The cracks between the paving stones  
Look like rivers of flowing veins  
Strange people who know me  
Peeping from behind every window pane  
The girl I used to love  
Lives in this yellow house  
Yesterday she passed me by  
She doesn't want to know me now  
  
Can you see the real me?  
Can ya?  
Can ya?  
Can you see the real me?  
Can ya?  
Woah, yeah!  
  
I ended up with a preacher  
Full of lies and hate  
I seemed to scare him a little  
So he showed me to the golden gate  
  
Can you see the real me, preacher?  
Preacher?  
Can you see the real me, preacher?  
Preacher?  
  
Can you see  
Can you see  
Can you see  
Woah  
  
Can you see the real me, Doctor?  
  
Can you see the real me, Ma?  
  
Can you see the real me?
