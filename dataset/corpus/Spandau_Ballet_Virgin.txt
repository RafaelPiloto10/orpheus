I could tell you a fairytale,  
Hold your hand oh so small and frail,  
But these lies are to no avail  
In these blues  
I could give you security,  
Protect your eyes from what you see,  
But I can't give you a guarantee,  
Win or loose  
Just trust in my love now baby,  
I'll show you what's wrong,  
Oh this is all I can give you baby,  
So sing this song, sing it, sing it  
Oh, we are virgin,  
Just as bright as the blinding snow  
Oh, we are virgin  
And we just don't wanna let go,  
We are virgin  
Your skin is new and your eyes are wide,  
Don't let that evil get inside,  
I know it's hard to run and hide,  
In these times  
So hold your face to the sun today,  
I'll take your hand and we'll walk away,  
Show them all you don't have to pay  
For these crimes  
Just trust in my love now baby,  
I'll show you what's wrong,  
Oh this is all I can give you baby,  
So sing this song, sing it, sing it  
Oh, we are virgin,  
Just as bright as the blinding snow  
Oh, we are virgin  
And we just don't wanna let go  
And so if you go away,  
I'll keep the fire burning,  
Keep the fire burning all night  
All through the wind and the rain  
I'll keep the fire burning,  
Keep the fire burning  
Just trust in my love now baby,  
I'll show you what's wrong,  
Oh this is all I can give you baby,  
So sing this song, sing it, sing it  
Oh, we are virgin,  
Just as bright as the blinding snow  
Oh, we are virgin  
And we just don't wanna let go,  
We are virgin
