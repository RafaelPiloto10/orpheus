Circle sky  
Telling lies  
Here I stand  
At demand  
  
And it looks we've made it once again  
And it looks we've made it once again  
  
Color sound  
All around  
Wing tip smile  
Sees for miles  
  
And it looks we've made it once again  
And it looks we've made it once again  
  
Its a very extraordinary scene  
To those who don't understand  
But what you have seen you must believe  
If you can  
If you can  
  
Hamilton  
Smiling down  
Telling more  
Than before  
  
And it looks we've made it once again  
And it looks we've made it once again  
Yes it looks like we've made it to the end
