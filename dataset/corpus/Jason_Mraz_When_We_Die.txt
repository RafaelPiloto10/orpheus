When we die is it just like sleeping?  
Does the light mean that it's light like in air?  
Will I dream? Will I get to meet Jesus?  
Or like the lover will I come right back?  
  
Years go fast live each day like it's the last,  
Need not waste time asking why did my life,  
No holding back  
  
Like a wind we've been solved,  
We sing to the memories of long days  
Gone so do I sing along, I'll remember you  
  
Years go fast, I'm already looking back,  
Me, I know I won't last cause when I cry I don't just cry  
I fold in half  
  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
  
There's a fear about leaving here  
That the devil you will find but if love,  
If love is all there ever was,  
There'll be peace on the other side  
  
Years go fast live each day like it's the last,  
Me, I'll go out dancing cause when I die  
I know I'm gonna fly into an angels hands  
  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved
