Way down yonder in New Orleans  
In the land of the dreamy scenes  
There's a Garden of Eden  
You know what I mean  
  
Creole babies with flashin' eyes  
Softly whisper their tender sighs then stop  
Won't you give your lady fair a little smile?  
Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while  
  
We've got heaven right here on earth  
With those beautiful queens  
Way down yonder in New Orleans  
  
You're gonna find heaven right here on earth  
With all them beautiful queens  
Way down yonder in New Orleans  
I'm goin' down yonder to New Orleans  
It's way down yonder in New Orleans
