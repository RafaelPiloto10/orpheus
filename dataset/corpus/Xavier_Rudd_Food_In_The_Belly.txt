So go but be kind  
You have luck on your side  
Born into a family with food in their bellies  
And a car for them to drive  
  
People sleeping on the concrete  
Still smile behind their signs  
So go now be happy and be free  
You have so much time  
  
If you go chances are you'll come again  
If you come chances are you'll go  
So be mellow let it flow let it bend  
I'll see you somewhere at the end  
  
So go but be kind...
