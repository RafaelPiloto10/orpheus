Having a good time, baby  
You're having a ball  
Your daddy don't dig what you look like  
Don't dig it at all  
Don't understand  
What you're going through  
No, no, no, no, no, no, he don't  
  
He says there's only one way that you stay alive  
Keep working for your pension till you're sixty five  
Hey, no, no, don't dig it at all  
  
You've grown up a big girl, baby  
You're doing all right  
You sleep in the daytime, baby now  
You're leaping all night  
Got your own scene  
Said you're doing fine  
My, my, my, doing fine, girl  
  
Live like you want, let them call you a freak  
You'll be a baby factory when you're married a week  
Oh, no, no, no, can you live in a box? Get out, get out  
  
You're having a good time, baby  
You're loving your life  
There's more things ahead now, baby  
Than being a wife  
Well, I love your mind  
'Cause you know it's free  
Little darlin'  
  
Don't worry about the people who scream and shout  
Just give them fifty years and they might forget it out  
Hey, yeah, I've gotta have me a good time  
Darling, let it all hang out
