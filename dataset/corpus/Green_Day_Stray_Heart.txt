I lost my way  
Oh baby this stray heart  
Went to another  
Can you recover baby?  
Oh you're the only one that I'm dreamin' of  
Your precious heart  
Was torn apart by me and you  
  
You're not alone  
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong  
We're not alone  
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just can't have you  
  
I said a thousand times  
And now a thousand one  
We'll never part  
I'll never stray again from you  
This dog is destined for a home to your heart  
We'll never part  
I'll never stray again from you  
You're not alone  
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong  
We're not alone  
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just can't have you  
  
You're not alone  
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong  
We're not alone  
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just can't have you  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just  
Just can't have you
