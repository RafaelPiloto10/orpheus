Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.  
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth,  
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.  
She didn't mean it,  
I should have seen it,  
But now it's too late.  
  
I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams,  
Now it seems,  
This is how the story ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say,  
"Can't we be friends?"  
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong,  
Not for long,  
I can see the way this ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say,  
"Can't we be friends?"  
Why should I care though she gave me the air,  
Why should I cry,  
Heave a sigh,  
And wonder why,  
And wonder why?  
I thought I found the gal I could trust,  
What a bust, this is how the story ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say,  
"Can't we be just friends?"
