Feeling daft beyond gone bland  
Made it to the goal on lense  
President, he just got hair down below  
Tomorrow never more...  
Made it to the BCP  
Everybody knows it's me  
I got up another sand,  
The guilty cell  
Tomorrow never more...  
  
I Got The Law (x23)  
  
Feeling Dove beyond con-pen (Convict Penitentiary)  
Nobody can take it there  
Feel it now and do yourself until you're gone  
Tomorrow never more...  
Tomorrow never more...
