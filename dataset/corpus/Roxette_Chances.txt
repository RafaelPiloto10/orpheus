Hear my call, here and everywhere I've been walking the streets in despair.  
One more fire turns a shade of grey, one more tear is lost in the rain.  
  
And I say that I love you.  
I say that I need you.  
Baby I leave you a sign of desire.  
No shadow will haunt you,  
No heart will desert you,  
No one will hurt you,  
No space or no time.  
  
Got to got you got to got to take your chances on me,  
Like the river will lead the water to the sea,  
Take on me, take your chances on me.  
Don't ever let it be.  
Don't ever let it be.  
  
There's a night when you close your eyes around a dream that shines like the
sun.  
Everyone knows it's beautiful,  
Tell me why you want to dream it alone.  
  
And I say that I love you,  
I say that I need you,  
Baby I leave you the lines in my palm.  
No darkness will get you,  
No heart will desert you,  
Nothing can hurt you or do you any harm.  
  
Got to...
