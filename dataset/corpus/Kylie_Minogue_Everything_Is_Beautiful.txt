Beautiful  
Beautiful  
  
I'm losing my way in this night  
Walking away from the light  
Surrender will be my escape  
Breaking the walls of my mind  
I'm one step ahead of the truth  
I hear what I want to hear and I hear you and  
  
[Chorus]  
If I lie with you long enough  
I can see the things I'm dreaming of  
Let's go through the ritual  
Until everything is beautiful  
  
Beautiful  
Beautiful  
  
I'm getting a taste for this high  
For bending the rules of what's right  
But fooling myself feels so sweet  
Reality looks black and white  
Pulling the ripcord, I dive  
It's a cardboard kingdom, but it makes me feel that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Beautiful  
Beautiful  
  
And now I'm traveling at such blissful speed  
No need to think at this velocity  
The things I feel begin to fade to black  
Now I've burned my map and I won't go back 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if I lie with you long enough  
I can see the things I'm dreaming of  
So let's go through the ritual  
Until everything is beautiful  
  
Beautiful  
Beautiful  
Beautiful
