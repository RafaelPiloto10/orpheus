Baljeet: Good King Wenceslas looked out  
On the Feast of Stephen...  
  
Buford: Sorry I'm late. I was busy doin' some rewrites.  
Baljeet: Rewrites?  
Buford: I've highlighted your parts. Now sing along.  
  
Buford: Santa Claus and all his elves  
Are making gifts for Buford  
Baljeet: I don't think that's how it goes  
Buford: Nobody's askin' you, nerd  
  
Baljeet: Buford! You're completely disrespecting this classic song. You're  
Ignoring the historical context. King Wenceslas was a great man. You have  
No idea what this song is about!  
Buford: I know all about this song.  
  
Buford: The words were by an English guy  
The music, Scandanavian  
Wenceslas was five-foot-six  
He kept his face unshaven  
Though just a duke throughout his life  
He always ruled so justly  
His kingly title was conferred  
Upon him posthumously  
  
Baljeet: Well, I stand corrected. You seem to have a lot of information.  
But if you know so much about it, why do you not sing the original song?  
Buford: I like my version better. It's about me!  
  
Buford: Buford should get lots of gifts  
Every Christmas season  
When I see presents just for me  
It always is so pleasin'  
That is why I changed the words  
To make the song more edgy  
If you don't like the way I sing  
You'll get a Christmas wedgie
