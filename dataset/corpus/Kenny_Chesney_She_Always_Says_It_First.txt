Not a day goes by that I don't tell her  
How beautiful she is  
How kind and caring, I'm always swearing  
She's the reason that I live  
  
I make it a point to point out every good thing that she does  
How she has everything I need  
And I can't get enough  
  
Well I always tell her I love her  
And how lost I'd be without her  
And God knows I mean every word  
I always tell her I love her  
But she always says it first  
  
Not a night goes by that I don't tell her  
I'm a lucky man  
Pull her close and let her know  
How proud of her I am  
And I'm so into her I swear  
It tears me inside out  
And I make sure she sees that she's what  
This old boy's about  
  
Well I always tell her I love her  
And how lost I'd be without her  
And God knows I mean every word  
I always tell her I love her  
But she always says it first  
  
She always says it first
