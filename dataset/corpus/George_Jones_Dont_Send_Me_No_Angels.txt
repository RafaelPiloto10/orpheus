When the storm clouds gather and I'm losing my mind  
She stands right beside me she lights up my day  
She's the one thing I found in a world that's gone wrong  
She's the words and the music to the world's finest song  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord let me keep her at least for a while  
I promise I'll love her 'till I've walked my last mile  
When your trumpets are sounding and you've played my song  
Don't send me no angels 'cause I've got my own  
  
She stayed with me through the hard times that's still goin' on  
That old feeling between us it's still coming on strong  
When my eyes close forever and my last breath is gone  
Don't send me no angels 'cause I've got my own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't send me no angels 'cause I've got my own
