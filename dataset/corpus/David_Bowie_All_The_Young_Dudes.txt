Well Billy rapped all night  
About his suicide  
How he'd kick it in the head  
When he was twenty-five  
Speed jive don't want to stay alive  
When you're twenty-five  
And Wendy's stealing clothes  
From Marks and Sparks  
(unlocked cars)  
And Freedy's got spots (zits)  
From ripping off the stars from his face  
Funky little boat race  
Television man is crazy  
Saying we're juvenile deliquent wrecks  
Oh man I need tv  
When I got T Rex  
Oh brother you guessed  
I'm a dude dad

Now Lucy looks sweet  
'cause he dresses like a queen  
But he can kick like a mule  
It's a real  
Mean team  
But we can love  
Oh yes we can love  
And my brother's back at home  
With his Beatles and his Stones  
We never got it off  
On that revolution stuff  
What a drag  
Too many snags  
Now I've drunk a lot of wine  
And I'm feeling fine  
Got to race  
Some cat to bed  
Oh is there concrete all around  
Or is it in my head  
Yeah I'm a dude dad
