Take time to see the wonders of the world  
To see the things you've only ever heard of  
Dream life the way you think it ought to be  
See things you thought you'd never ever see  
  
Take a cruise to China or a train to Spain  
Go round the world again and again  
Meet a girl on a boat meet a boy on a train  
And fall in love without the pain  
  
Everybody needs love and adventure  
Everybody needs cash to spend  
Everybody needs love and affection  
Everybody needs two or three friends  
  
[Chorus]  
These are the things  
These are the things  
The things that dreams are made of  
These are the things  
These are the things  
The things that dreams are made of  
  
Take a lift to the top of the Empire State  
Take a drive across the Golden Gate  
March, march, march across Red Square  
Do all the things you've ever dared  
  
Everybody needs love and adventure  
Everybody needs cash to spend  
Everybody needs love and affection  
Everybody needs two or three friends  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like fun and money and food and love  
And things you never thought of  
  
These are the things  
These are the things  
The things that dreams are made of  
  
New York, ice cream, TV, travel, good times  
Norman Wisdom, Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, good times  
  
[Chorus: x3]
