See that girl  
She put me in a whirl  
She's got a way of breakin' hearts  
Man o man  
I wonder if I can  
She's got a way of breaking hearts  
Seems like she is always  
Workin' on the sly  
Then she tells her poor man  
Good bye  
Holy smoke  
I wonder if there's hope  
She's got a way of breakin' hearts  
I will not tarry  
I'm askin' her to marry me  
Even though she's got a way of  
Breakin' hearts
