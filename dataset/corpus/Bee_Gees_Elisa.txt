Elisa  
Bee Gees  
  
All that I need is just a piece of paper  
Say a few lines, make up my mind  
so she can read it later, when I'm gone  
Elisa, goodbye , Elisa  
  
All that I need is just a quiet corner  
Bring to the light , things I must write  
Got to get it over with, choose  
Elisa , goodbye, Elisa  
  
The song that I sing  
The times I've tried to hide it  
I'm sorry to say, I'm going away  
That's what I've decided on  
I've tried  
Elisa , goodbye, Elisa  
  
Goodbye Elisa  
Elisa goodbye  
Elisa goodbye  
Elisa, Elisa
