It's hard to see reason when there's so little hope alive  
But this is the season to put faith in innocent eyes  
We're all thinking too much, we're so out of touch  
We need to start over again  
So just let it wander, 'cause you're never to old to pretend  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell you, just a little miracle is all you need to believe  
Just a little miracle is all you need to believe  
  
It's not too late to wake up  
Don't make no difference who you are  
Just take off your make-up  
And discover the child in your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're all thinking too much, we're so out of touch  
We need to start over again  
So just let it wander  
'Cause you're never too old to pretend  
  
[Chorus]
