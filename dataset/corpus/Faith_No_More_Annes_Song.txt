"HEY!" WHAT?? "Oh nothing, just wondering why it is you're doing  
that whatever it is you're doing. "Oh yeah, why?" I dunno it just  
doesn't seem like something you'd be doing that's all you of all  
people, know what I mean? "Yeah I know it's been bugging you since the  
day I was born, huh? I asked my friend Anne about it. I said, 'Anne,  
Anne, Anne, what am I supposed to do, it's been bugging them since the  
day that I was born.' She said 'Do whatever the hell you want to do!  
Now is the time to do whatever you want, and it will still turn out  
great. You've got the world at your feet.'"  
I never claimed to be different, I only said I was bored and she's  
tired of your uniqueness, it sends her over head first then the rest  
of her follows, the breath of life, it never left her hollow...  
I can do everything, she said, she said with a smile.  
And I can go anywhere tonight, cause I'm with Anne.
