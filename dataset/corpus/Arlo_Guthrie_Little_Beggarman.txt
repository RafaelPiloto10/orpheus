I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been  
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green  
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue  
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue  
  
Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best  
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest  
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do  
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo  
  
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn  
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn  
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through  
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo  
  
Who should awaken but the woman of the house  
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten when I said boo!  
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.  
  
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,  
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say  
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do  
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be  
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by  
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue  
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too  
  
Over the fields with the pack on my back  
Over the field with my great heavy sack  
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through  
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu  
  
Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night  
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light  
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo  
It's "Good-bye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu.
