Bury my soul  
where the dust meets the sea  
Turn it loose in a lonely place  
where man can still be free  
Make up my clothes and sheets  
in a ball, put them in the ground  
Tell my children only truths  
teach them to be proud  
Tell them dreams and miracles  
when thy thunder stops  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
I was born a travelling trooper  
but I laid my wings to rest  
Once I beat myself in squallor  
now I feather up my nest  
There are flags in my back yard  
colours on my wall  
I pay my servant well  
but I made the bastard crawl  
that I don't hear that thunder start  
Bury my heart!  
There's a lily in the valley  
where I brought the news to Ro  
I offered him my visions but  
the heathen rose to go  
So I took my shining sabre and I slew  
my sinning friend  
A christian burial was all he needed  
to make him whole again  
And I looked up way above me  
and God rent the sky apart  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
We're God's chosen people  
this and other truths I know  
Put them into vicious practice  
because the bible tells me so  
And I drowned the noble savage  
in the blessed holy water  
I burned his filthy village  
and I civilized his daughter  
The liars in this world  
who say we shame the blood of Christ  
But killing is his mercy  
and nits grow into lice  
And all those gooks I napalmed  
man, I did it in God's name  
When the fools put me on trial I shouted out  
I'm not to blame -- I did it for him!  
I did it for him!  
I did it for him!  
He made do it!  
He tore the heavens apart  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
Bury my heart!  
Now I'm going to wilderness  
on a horse that I can trust  
I will die where I fall  
in the hot dry dust  
And if you come to that place  
remember this truth  
That he who's born to property  
is he who's born to lose  
Will you bury my soul  
where the dust meets the sea  
Will you bury my heart  
at Wounded Knee!  
Bury my heart  
at Wounded Knee!  
Bury my heart  
at Wounded Knee!  
Bury my heart!
