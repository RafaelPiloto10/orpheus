Everyone is looking at me.  
I can't get out of bed.  
There is evil in my head.  
Just let me be.  
Because when I hit the stage.  
It is gone and I am free.  
Goddamn you say you'll get up for me.  
  
You're the crowd come on give it back to me.  
You won't beg for me beg for me beg for me.  
  
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me.  
You're the crowd come on give it back to me.  
You won't beg for me be there for me beg for me.  
  
Tell me, how could this fade?  
I am going in shame.  
And I could not have my pain.  
Everyone please let me be.  
'Cause we're on stage.  
And it's gone and I am free.  
  
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me.  
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.  
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.  
  
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me.  
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.  
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.  
  
I feel the shame.  
I'm not insane.  
The things I feel now.  
Aren't the same.  
Who gives a fuck.  
  
If my life sucks?  
I just know one day.  
I won't give up.  
  
Everyone just let me be.  
  
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me.  
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.  
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.  
  
Goddamn you say you'll get up with me.  
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.  
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.  
  
Be there, for me.
