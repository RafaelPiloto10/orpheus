Mum's the word, don't start a ruckus, it's best Aunt Sue don't know  
''cause she's so proud, so if she finds out I reckon we ought alert Uncle Joe  
  
Mum's the word, don't start a ruckus, Aunt Sue don't know Uncle Joe  
If rumour starts 'bout what she's been doin', I reckon we ought alert Uncle
Joe  
  
Mum's the word, don't start a ruckus, Aunt Sue's been doing it, too  
They tell Uncle Joe everything they know, reckon we ought alert Aunt Sue  
''cause Uncle Joe's liable to hurt Aunt Sue  
  
Mum's the word, un-huh, she done heard, Aunt Sue started to turn him on  
Say I heard some talk, you ain't got no squawk, been checkin' out stone to
stone  
Just pack up and leave me alone
