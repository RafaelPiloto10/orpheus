Well the talk on the street  
Says you might go solo  
A good friend of mine saw you leavin' by the back door  
  
[Chorus:]  
I need to know (I need to know)  
I need to know (I need to know)  
If you think you're gonna leave  
Then you better say so  
I need to know (I need to know)  
I need to know (I need to know)  
Because I don't know how long  
I can hold on  
And if your makin' me wait  
If you're leadin' me on  
I need to know (I need to know)  
I need to know (I need to know)  
  
Who would a thought  
That you'd fall for his line  
All of a sudden its me on the outside  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I need to know (I need to know)  
I need to know
