I can take it  
Sideways  
Sometimes  
Some things  
Waves  
Feel like  
I'm on the other side  
Of every feeling ever felt  
Hold it close  
... Screaming  
I've watched this scene a thousand times  
  
(so) I can taste it  
And in my head  
  
This is how it all begins  
Yes, I am becoming  
And this is how it all begins  
What did you expect?  
This is not an exit  
This has begun  
  
The blackest eyes  
... Welcoming...  
I can almost see  
The new flesh  
A new disguise  
Please  
  
Give it to me  
I can take it  
  
Give it to me  
I can take it
