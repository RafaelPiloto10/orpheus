Strike while the iron is hot  
Steel is strongest so say we all  
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? - no -  
They tried to test our spirit  
They tasted steel before we were done  
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past  
All blown away like a shot from a gun  
  
We cast our lot together four still stand as one  
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one  
  
Brothers of metal  
We are fighting with power and steel  
Fighting for metal metal that's real  
Brothers of metal will always be there  
Standing together with hands in the air  
  
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound  
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground  
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall  
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall  
  
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none  
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son  
  
Brothers of metal  
We are fighting with power and steel  
Fighting for metal metal that's real  
Brothers of metal will always be there  
Standing together with hands in the air  
  
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound  
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground  
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall  
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall  
  
Brothers of metal  
We are fighting with power and steel  
Fighting for metal metal that's real  
Brothers of metal will always be there  
Standing together with hands in the air
