Take a look inside  
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no  
I'll beat around the bush  
I've got nothing but time, oh no, oh no  
  
You've got me holding on to nothing  
But nothing is all I've got  
  
[Chorus:]  
Leave me, leave me,  
I'm a shut it all down  
You've got a tendency to bring a man down  
I give up, I give up  
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run  
  
So this is what it feels like  
I'll give you the last word  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright  
  
Now this is the town, this is the place  
If you are the one to give disgrace a name  
Then So be it  
  
You've got me holding on to nothing  
But nothing is all I've got  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Oh take my car, oh take my house  
I never liked that beat up motor mouth  
And it only looks so warm tonight  
Just like a stranger in the candlelight  
  
Take take take take  
Take it all  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Leave me now  
Leave me now
