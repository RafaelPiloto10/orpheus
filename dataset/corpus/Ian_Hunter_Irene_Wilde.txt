When I was just sixteen - I stood waiting for a dream -  
At barker street bus station every night  
When I tried to get it on - she just looked at me with scorn - my courage  
Turned to dust and I took flight  
  
For those looks they seemed to say  
You ain't nuthin' - go away  
You're just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed  
I'm gonna be somebody - someday  
  
Her name was irene wilde - oh such beauty for a child  
When she started dating boys - I nearly died  
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand  
I felt I had to crawl away and hide  
In my mother's living room I composed so many tunes  
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say  
Gonna be somebody - someday  
  
Wild as your name I soon left that country town  
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs  
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud  
It's that face in the crowd - didn't dig it - much too proud...  
  
When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream  
A barker street bus station non affair  
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad  
If you hadn't messed me up I'd still be there  
And I think most folks agree, a little put-down makes them see  
They ain't no chain - just a link and that's why you made me think  
Gonna be somebody - be somebody - be somebody - someday
