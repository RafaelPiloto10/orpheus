I have often walked down this street before  
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before  
All at once am I several stories high  
Knowing I'm on the street where you live  
  
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?  
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?  
Does enchantment pour out of every door?  
No, it's just on the street where you live  
  
And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near  
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear  
  
People stop and stare, they don't bother me  
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be  
Let the time go by, I won't care if I  
Can be here on the street where you live
