I've been casing your joint  
For the best years of my life  
Like the look of your stuff  
Outta sight  
When I'm hungry and when I'm cold  
When I'm having it rough  
Or just getting old  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
They'll die and join the queue  
  
Better man the barricades  
I'm coming in tonight  
Had a line of my dust  
Outta sight  
When I wonder and when I roam  
I'll find a soul I can trust  
I'm coming home  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
They'll die and join the queue, sing it  
  
I'm gonna break right into heaven  
I can't wait anymore  
  
Heaven's gates won't hold me  
I'll saw those suckers down  
Laughing loud at your locks  
When they hit the ground  
Every icon in every town  
Hear this, your number's up  
I'm coming 'round  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
They'll die and join the queue, sing it  
  
I'm gonna break right into heaven  
I can't wait anymore  
  
How many times will I have to tell you  
You don't have to wait to die  
You can have it all, any time you want it  
Yeah, the kingdom's all inside
