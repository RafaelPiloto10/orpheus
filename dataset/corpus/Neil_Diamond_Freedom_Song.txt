Two hundred years and more  
And here we are today  
With freedom still our guiding light  
Defending it with all our might  
We're never gonna change  
Or ever look away  
We stand for freedom everyday  
They'll never take us down  
  
Tho some may try  
We're gonna stand our ground  
It's do or die  
The freedom that we've found  
Can't be denied  
And they can never take us down oh no  
Our freedom is why  
  
Got freedom to believe  
And live the way we choose  
Ain't that's what freedoms all about  
It's something we can't never lose  
And if we go astray  
Let freedom be the light  
That takes us through the darkest night  
  
They'll never take us down  
Tho some may try  
We're gonna stand our ground  
It's do or die  
The freedom that we've found  
Can't be denied  
Our faith is like a light  
That keeps us warm  
It burns inside.  
  
We've come this way before  
A hundred times or more  
But someone's watching over us  
And we believe in God we trust  
But if we hold on strong  
We'll make it through the night  
And walk in freedom's shining light  
  
They'll never take us down  
Tho some may try  
We're gonna stand our ground  
It's do or die  
The freedom that we've found  
Can't be denied  
We know without a doubt  
We'll get through this,  
We've been through worse  
  
They'll never take us down  
Not now or any day  
Our freedom don't come free  
But it's worth the price we paid  
The dream inside us all  
It can not be denied  
Together let us raise our freedom's flag  
And let it fly  
  
Never take us down  
(No, oh no)  
Oh no they won't  
(Never take us down)  
Praise our freedom now  
(Let praise it now)  
We know it's true  
  
They'll never take us down  
Tho some may try  
We've only got to show  
The reason why  
Our road together's made  
Of tears and pride  
We know they can never take us down  
And freedom's why  
Together let's raise our freedoms flag  
Where eagles fly
