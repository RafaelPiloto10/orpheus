Who' s child am I gonna be tonight?  
Who' s bed am I gonna sleep in tonight?  
You told the other ones  
I was your brother's child  
You told the ones  
I was your sister's child  
Everytime they come to the house  
I got to change my name  
Everytime they come to the house  
I got to change my identity  
Whose child am I gonna be tonight?  
As he walked away with tears in his eyes  
I felt every pain that he felt  
I cried every tear that he cried  
Mama why?......  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you could love me the way I am  
  
Whose dogs are gonna be my friends tonight?  
Whose bin am I gonna eat out of tonight?  
The welfare people when they come  
To the house you told me to say nothing  
Every time they want to take me away  
You say everything is alright  
who's bins am I gonna eat out of tonight?  
As he walked away with tears in his eyes  
I felt every pain that he felt  
I cried every tear that he cried  
Mama why?.......  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you could love me the way I am
