You made my day, You came my way  
You heard me every, every time I prayed  
You gave me peace, You gave me grace  
You put a smile upon my face  
You brought the sunshine  
(In my life)  
You are the lifeline  
(Saved my life)  
Since then I have know Christ  
There has been such a change in my life  
You made my day, You came my way  
You heard me every, every time I prayed  
You gave me peace, You gave me grace  
You put a smile upon my face

Nothing to hard for my God to work out  
No matter what the problem, God can always solve 'em  
Try Him today

And He'll come Your way
