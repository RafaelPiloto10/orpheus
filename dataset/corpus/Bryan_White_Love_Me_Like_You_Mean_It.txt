You don't have to try so hard  
What's with the attitude  
All I want is who you are  
All you gotta do is  
  
Love me like you mean it  
Every day I really want to know  
That's you're willing to lay your heart on the line  
Talking is fine but feeling is believing  
Love me like you mean it  
  
You can try the latest style  
But that won't turn my head  
If you want to drive me wild  
And keep me interested  
They'll try to tell you  
That the secret to the mind of a man  
Is to be some kind of fantasy  
But what I'm needing  
You ain't ever gonna find in a magazine  
It's in between you and me
