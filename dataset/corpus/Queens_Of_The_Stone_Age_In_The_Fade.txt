Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the heart  
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow  
Way down low, I never do you any good  
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could  
  
Ain't gonna run  
Just live till you die, want to drown  
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone  
There's nothing to save I know  
You live till you die  
  
Live till you die, I know  
  
Loosing feelin', but I couldn't get the way ?  
Countin' and breathin', disappearin' in the fade  
Lay down low, I never do you any good  
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could  
  
Ain't gonna run  
Just live till you die, want to drown  
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone  
There's nothing to save I know  
You live till you die
