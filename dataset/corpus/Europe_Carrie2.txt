When lights go down  
I see no reason  
For you to cry  
We've been througth this before  
In every time, in every season  
God knows I've tried  
So please don't ask for more  
Can you see it in my eyes  
That this might be our last Good Bye  
Carrie, Carrie  
Things they change my friend  
Carrie, Carrie  
Maybe will meet Again, Somewhere, Again  
I read your mind with no intention  
I feel unkind, I wish I could explain  
It all takes time, oh lot of passion  
If is a crime how can I feel no pain  
Can you see it in my eyes  
That this might be our last good bye  
Carrie Carrie  
Things they change my friend  
Carrie Carrie  
Maybe will meet Again  
Can you see it my eyes  
That this might be our last good bye  
Carrie carrie  
Things that change Carrie Carrie Carrie  
Maybe will meet again, somewhere, again  
When Lights go Down
