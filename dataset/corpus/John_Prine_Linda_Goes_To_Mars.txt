I just found out yesterday that linda goes to mars  
Every time I sit and look at pictures of used cars  
She'll turn on her radio and sit down in her chair  
And look at me across the room, as if I wasn't there  
Chorus:  
Oh my stars! my linda's gone to mars  
Well I wish she wouldn't leave me here alone  
Oh my stars! my linda's gone to mars  
Well, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.  
Something, somewhere, somehow took my linda by the hand  
And secretly decoded our sacred wedding band  
For when the moon shines down up on our happy, humble home  
Her inner space gets tortured by some outer space unknown.  
Repeat chorus:  
Now I ain't seen no saucers 'cept the ones upon the shelf  
And if I ever seen one I'd keep it to myself  
For if there's life out there somewhere beyond this life on earth  
Then linda must have gone out there and got her money's worth.  
Repeat chorus:  
Yeah, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.
