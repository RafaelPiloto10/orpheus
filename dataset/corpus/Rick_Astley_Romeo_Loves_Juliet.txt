Sitting On The Balcony Sipping On Her Herbal Tea  
That's Juliet, Juliet  
Talking On Her Mobile Phone Doesn't Like To Be Alone  
That's Juliet, Juliet  
And If She Won't Hang Up Or Put Down That Cup  
How's That Girl Ever Gonna Know  
That Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Wishing Her Life Away Nothing Left For Me To Say  
About Juliet, Juliet  
I Don't Wanna Know Let The Poison Steel The Show  
For Juliet, Juliet  
And If She Can't See The Wood For The Trees  
How's That Girl Ever Gonna Know  
That Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Love Keeps No Time But Life Slips Through Your Fingers  
Love Has No Design But It's Memory Lingers  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet
