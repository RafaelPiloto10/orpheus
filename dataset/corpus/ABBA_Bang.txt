Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
And if you're warm and tender  
I'll kiss you, return to sender  
Please surrender  
  
Bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love
