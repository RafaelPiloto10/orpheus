When love takes a back seat to life  
When a man runs away from his wife  
That's when you know he's in the world  
When a guy tries to round up his mate  
But she's gone and it's gettin' too late  
That's when you know he lost his girl  
so it happens all the time  
don't get low just stand in line  
take your turn now make your move  
and crush that doubt with a ton o' love  
When woman takes a back seat to man  
She has to tell him where to go if she can  
And she decides to wear his ring  
Find a girl with the face of a clock  
Her hands move forward till you can't stop  
She comes from above with a ton o' love
