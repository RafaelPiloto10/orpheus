We used to say  
That come the day  
When we'd all be making songs  
Or finding better words  
These ideas never lasted long  
  
The way is up  
Along the road  
The air is growing thin  
Too many friends who tried  
Were blown off this mountain with the wind  
  
Meet on the ledge  
We're gonna meet on the ledge  
When your time is up you're gonna meet all your friends  
Meet on the ledge  
We're gonna meet on the ledge  
If you really mean it, it all comes round again  
  
So here I sit  
I'm all alone  
But that's the only way to be  
You'll have your chance again  
Then you can do the work for me
