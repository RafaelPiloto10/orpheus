[Chorus]  
Storms never last, do they baby.  
Bad times all pass with the wind  
  
Your hand in mine stills the thunder, and your love makes the sun  
Want to shine.  
  
I've followed you down so many roads,  
Baby I've picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs.  
And every road you took I know your search was for the truth.  
And the cloud that's brewing now won't be your last.  
  
[Chorus]
