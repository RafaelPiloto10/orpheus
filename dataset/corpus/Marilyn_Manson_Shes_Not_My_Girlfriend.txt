She's Not my Girlfriend  
Her heart is in my hand  
It shivers like a toad  
She tries to understand the  
Tiny lump that's down inside her throat  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Her head is in my lap  
It twists and coughs and sings  
Her hair is in my grasp  
It hangs and swings like swollen strings  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Her face is inside out  
An open book report  
I read what she's about  
And she's filled with words that hurt  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Sometimes I want her in  
Sometimes I want her out  
My perception of sin  
Is filled with pain and fear and doubt  
  
She she she she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
  
Her clothes are on the ground  
A crumpled rainbow mass  
She's scattered all around  
And she's scattered now like broken glass  
It goes  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
Suck suck  
  
Sometimes I want her in  
Sometimes I want her out  
My perception of sin  
Is filled with pain and fear and doubt  
  
She she she she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend  
No no, I'm not who you think I am  
  
She she, she isn't my girlfriend
