(Traditional)  
Bright morning stars are rising,  
Bright morning stars are rising,  
Bright morning stars are rising,  
Day is a-breaking in my soul.  
Oh, where are our dear mothers,  
Day is a-breaking in my soul.  
They are down in the valley praying,  
Day is a-breaking in my soul.  
Oh where are our dear fathers,  
Day is a-breaking in my soul.  
They have gone to heaven shouting,  
Day is a-breaking in my soul.  
Bright morning stars are rising,  
Day is a-breaking in my soul.
