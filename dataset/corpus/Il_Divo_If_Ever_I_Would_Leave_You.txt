If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.  
Seeing you in summer I never would go.  
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a
luster.  
That puts gold to shame.  
  
But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.  
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.  
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.  
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.  
  
And could I leave you running merrily through the snow  
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow  
  
If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time  
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so  
Oh, no! not in spring-time.  
Summer, winter or fall.  
No, never could I leave you at all.  
  
No, never could I leave you at all.
