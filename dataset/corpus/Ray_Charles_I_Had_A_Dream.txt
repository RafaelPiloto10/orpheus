Well I have a feeling (I had a dream) things ain't going right (I had a dream)  
Come over baby (I had a dream) let me tell you about my dream last night (I
had a dream)  
I dreamed someone else (I had a dream) was here with you (I had a dream)  
Doing all the things (I had a dream) that I used to do (I had a dream)  
Please don't let this dream come true (I had a dream)  
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream)  
Baby, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)  
  
Well, well you know I came home (I had a dream) and found you gone (I had a
dream)  
I never felt so (I had a dream) so all alone (I had a dream)  
Oh with your voice (I had a dream) ringing in my ear (I had a dream)  
I just could not hold (I had a dream) hold back my tear (I had a dream)  
Please don't let it come true (I had a dream)  
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream)  
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)  
  
Well, well, well it seems (I had a dream) that you love me no more (I had a
dream)  
I never felt (I had a dream) felt this way before (I had a dream)  
You were so cold (I had a dream) I wonder why (I had a dream)  
You didn't care (I had a dream) how much I cried (I had a dream)  
Baby please don't let it come true (I had a dream)  
Won't you say that I'm not losing you (I had a dream).  
Oh, say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)  
  
Well, well, you know I begged you (I had a dream) to come back fast (I had a
dream)  
You know without you baby (I had a dream) I know I couldn't last (I had a
dream)  
Oh, but you would not listen (I had a dream) listen to my plea (I had a dream)  
You turned around (I had a dream) and walked away from me (I had a dream)  
Now you know you can't let it come true now (I had a dream).  
Tell me I'm not losing you (I had a dream).  
Won't you say it was a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)
