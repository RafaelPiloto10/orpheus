Like a long lonely stream  
I keep running for the dream  
Moving on moving on  
Like a branch on a tree  
I keep reaching to be free  
Moving on moving on  
There's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
There's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Gotta find me a place in the sun  
Like a dusty old road  
I get weary from the load  
Moving on moving on  
Like this tired troubled earth  
I've been running since my birth  
Moving on moving on  
There's a place in the sun
