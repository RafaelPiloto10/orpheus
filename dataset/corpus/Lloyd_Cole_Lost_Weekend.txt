It took a lost weekend in a hotel in amsterdam  
And double pneumonia in a single room  
And the sickest joke was the price of the medicine  
Are you laughing at me now may I please laugh along with you  
  
This morning I woke up from a deep unquiet sleep  
With ashtray clothes and miss lonelyheart's pen  
With which I wrote for you a lovesong in tatoo  
Upon my palm 'twas stolen from me when jesus took my hand  
  
You see I I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it  
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces too easily  
  
I was a king bee with a head full of attitude  
Wore my heart on my sleeve like a stained  
My aim was to taboo you  
Could we meet in the marketplace  
Did I ever hey please did you wound my knees  
  
You see I I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it  
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces  
  
Yes it's too easy and there's nobody else to blame  
Will I hang my head in a crying shame  
There is nobody else to blame nobody else except my sweet self  
  
Again it took a lost weekend in a hotel in amsterdam  
Twenty four gone years to conclude in tears  
That the sickest joke was the price of the medicine  
Are you laughing at me now  
May I please laugh along  
  
I was a king bee with a head full of attitude  
And ashtray heart on my sleeve wounded knees  
And my one love song was a tatoo upon my palm  
You wrote upon me when you took my hand  
  
You see I I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it  
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces too easily
