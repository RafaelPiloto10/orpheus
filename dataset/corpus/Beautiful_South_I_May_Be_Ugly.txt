With a face like a crab's bus ticket  
And skin like a llama's door mat  
He was always gonna struggle  
Nature had seen to that  
  
He dreamt of those old-fashioned movies  
Where Bogart gets the dame  
But a lorry load of Lorre  
Is still the score of pain  
  
And he sings  
I may be ugly  
But I've got the bottle-opener  
He may be fat but he's got the cork-screw  
And in the party party politics of this ugly fame  
There is no orderly queue  
  
With a chin like a tramp's jukebox  
And eyes like a rhino's ash-tray  
It was always going to be pantomime  
That made him sing and dance anyway  
  
When you feel like London  
And you look like Hull  
You think Travolta pulled Newton, John  
Who did John Hurt pull?  
  
And they compliment the compliment  
And it's driving you insane  
It's like talking to a helicopter  
When you know that you're a plane  
  
Breath like a mountain goat's satchel  
Nose like a pool of sick  
But you always leave your flies ahoy  
'Cause the world wants to suck your dick  
Let it suck!  
  
And he sings  
I may be ugly  
But I've got the bottle-opener  
He may be fat but he's got the cork-screw  
And in the party party politics of this ugly fame  
There is no orderly queue
