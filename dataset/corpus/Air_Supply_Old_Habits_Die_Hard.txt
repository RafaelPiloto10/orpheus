Seems like yesterday my life had begun  
As we went through life trying to make it so much fun  
And I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
Lost restrictions since you've been gone  
And it's so hard trying to say that I was wrong  
Now I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
You know and I know  
that you can't live on memories alone  
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of  
Just one habit that I can't shake off  
It's you  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
Now I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of  
Just one habit that I can't shake off  
It's you  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard
