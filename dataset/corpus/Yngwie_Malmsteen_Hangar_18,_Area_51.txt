Beams of light up in the sky  
Malfunctioned machinery, lost in time  
Don't understand, I'm wondering why  
How can this happen its so out of line  
Strangers among us  
From beyond the stars  
Whatever you know keep your silence  
Unearthly ones from galaxies afar  
There will be violence  
  
They know something  
That we don't know  
What cannot be seen they'll never show  
Hangar eighteen, Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
For me to recall, they hypnotize  
It's all part of investigations  
They say that I just fantasize  
Just try to explain mutilations  
  
They know something  
That we don't know  
What cannot be seen they'll never show  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
We're victims of grand illusion  
Now we're lost in mass confusion  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
They know something  
That we don't know  
What cannot be seen they'll never show  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
We're victims of grand illusion  
Now we're lost in mass confusion  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen
