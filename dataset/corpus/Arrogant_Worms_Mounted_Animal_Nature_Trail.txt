On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail, you'll be sure to see  
All Mother Nature's favourite pets, all sitting rigidly  
They're never hungry any more, their last meal left them stuffed  
Don't worry, they won't walk away if you try and pet their fluff  
  
And the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The Mounted Animal Nature Trail, it's great for Mom and Dad  
Where else can Grandma and the kids see the silence of the lambs?  
Don't have to walk a hundred miles ore climb the steepest hill  
And the only fearsome sound you'll hear is the ringing of the till  
  
And the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this

The only things that bite are the bugs (Oww..)  
And unlike other theme parks, the mice won't say "Hello"  
And if you're having troubles with your own family pet  
You can bring him and add him to the trail  
  
Everyone, and the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive
