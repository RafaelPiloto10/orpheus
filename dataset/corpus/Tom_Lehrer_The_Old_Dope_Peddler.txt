When the shades of night are falling,  
Comes a fellow everyone knows.  
It's the old dope peddler,  
Spreading joy wherever he goes.  
Every evening you will find him,  
Around our neighborhood.  
It's the old dope peddler  
Doing well by doing good.  
  
He gives the kids free samples,  
Because he knows full well  
That today's young innocent faces  
Will be tomorrow's clientele.  
Here's a cure for all your troubles,  
Here's an end to all distress.  
It's the old dope peddler  
With his powdered happiness.
