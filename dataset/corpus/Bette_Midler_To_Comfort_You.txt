You've been down in the dumps  
It seems like forever.  
Now, what have they done to you?  
Not a single thing's turned out  
The way you imagined.  
It all looks unreachable to you.  
  
You don't know for the life of you  
What is missing,  
Or why it always happens to you.  
And you don't like yourself,  
You feel nobody's listening.  
You don't need another platitude.  
  
For a moment you forget  
And a smile comes to your face.  
Aah, but it doesn't last too long.  
It's like a string you got tied  
Around your finger  
Reminding you of  
Everything that's wrong.  
  
I won't try to say I know what you're feeling.  
I won't try to second guess you.  
I won't try to give advice you won't be needing.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
  
And I'd love to be the reason  
A smile comes to your face,  
Even if it doesn't last too long.  
And I'd love to take that string  
You've got tied around your finger  
Reminding you of everything that's wrong.  
  
I won't try to say I know what you're feeling.  
I won't try to second guess you.  
I won't try to give advice you won't be needing.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
I'm only here to comfort you.  
I'm only here to comfort you.
