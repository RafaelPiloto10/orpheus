When I opened your letter yesterday  
I could not believe my eyes  
Cause I've already given all I have to give  
And I think it must have slipped your mind  
But I remember not so long ago  
I gave it all, it's gone  
And I gave it all to you  
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine  
  
Oh, d'you hear me?  
I cannot believe it's true  
Are you really doing the things you do.  
No I cannot believe it's you, really you  
  
Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand  
They don't seem to realize  
They're listening but they're not hearing me  
They're being too cruel to be kind  
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone  
Cause I gave it all, it's gone  
And I gave it all to you  
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine  
  
Oh, d'you hear me?  
I cannot believe it's true  
Are you really doing the things you do.  
No I cannot believe it's you, really you  
  
Over and over I keep on telling myself  
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up  
Over and over I know it's really happening  
And there's nothing that I can say  
Cause nothing can change all the things that you've done to me  
Nothing can make me stay  
  
Oh, 'cause you know I cannot believe it's true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe it's you, really you  
  
I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you  
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through Never meant it to show  
It started happening, that's all you know.  
  
Oh, I gave it all to you  
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine  
  
Oh, d'you hear me?  
I cannot believe it's true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe it's you, really you  
  
Over and over I keep on telling myself  
Over and over I Hope I'm gonna make up  
But over and over I know it's really happening  
And there's nothing that I can say  
Cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me  
Nothing can make me stay  
  
Cause you know I cannot believe it's true  
Are you really doing the things you do  
No I cannot believe it's you, really you
