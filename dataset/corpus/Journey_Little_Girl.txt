It was just the month of May,  
Words got in my way, girl I'm so sorry  
So I'm reaching out to you,  
With the hope to see you through  
Just another day  
  
Do you see  
the words I'm trying to say,  
But words get in my way, girl I really mean it,  
Yes I warned you from the start  
That I could break your heart  
So girl don't stay  
  
Ooh, ooh little girl  
Ooh, ooh little girl  
ooh, ooh little girl  
  
I'm the fool that plays the part, the one  
That broke your heart,  
Girl I'm so sorry, so what more can a poor boy do,  
I'm reaching out to you,  
So now don't you stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shades turn red from green to blue,  
What more can I do, I told you this before,  
So please walk out hat door  
I told you from the start  
That love could break your heart,  
Girl I'm so sorry, ooh ooh little girl  
  
[Chorus]
