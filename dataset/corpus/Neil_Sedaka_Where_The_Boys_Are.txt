Where the boys are, someone waits for me  
A smilin' face, a warm embrace,  
Two arms to hold me tenderly  
Where the boys are, my true love will be  
He's walkin' down some street in town  
And I know he's lookin' there for me  
  
In the crowd of a million people  
I'll find my valentine  
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple  
And tell the world he's mine  
  
Till he holds me I wait impatiently  
Where the boys are, where the boys are  
Where the boys are, someone waits for me  
  
Till he holds me I wait impatiently  
Where the boys are, where the boys are  
Where the boys are, someone waits for me
