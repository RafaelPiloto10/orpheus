December will be magic again.  
Take a husky to the ice  
While Bing Crosby sings White Christmas. He makes you feel nice.  
December will be magic again.  
Old Saint Nicholas up the chimney,  
Just a-popping up in my memory.  
  
Ooh, dropping down in my parachute,  
The white city, she is so beautiful  
Upon the black-soot icicled roofs,  
Oh, and see how I fall.  
See how I fall  
("Fall!") [backwards]  
Like the snow.  
  
Come to cover the lovers.  
(Cover the lovers,  
But don't you wake them up.)  
Come to sparkle the dark up.  
(Sparkle the dark up,  
With just a touch of make-up.)  
Come to cover the muck up.  
(Cover the muck up,  
Oh, with a little luck.)  
  
December will be magic again.  
Light the canDLe-lights  
To conjure Mr. Wilde  
Into the Silent Night.  
Oh, it's quiet inside,  
Here in Oscar's mind.  
  
December will be magic again.  
Don't miss the brightest star.  
Kiss under mistletoe.  
I want to hear you laugh.  
Don't let the mystery go now.  
  
Oh, dropping down in my parachute,  
The white city, she is so beautiful  
Upon the black-soot icicled roofs,  
Oh, and see how I fall.  
See how I fall  
("Fall!") [backwards]  
Like the snow.  
  
Come to cover the lovers.  
(Cover the lovers,  
But don't you wake them up.)  
Come to sparkle the dark up.  
(Sparkle the dark up,  
With just a touch of make-up.)  
Come to cover the muck up  
(Cover the muck up,  
Oh, with a little luck.)  
  
Oh, I'm coming to cover the lovers.  
Oh, and I'm coming to sparkle the dark up.  
Oh, and I'm coming to cover the muck up.
