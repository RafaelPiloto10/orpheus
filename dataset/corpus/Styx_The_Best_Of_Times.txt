Tonight's the night we'll make history. Honey you and I.  
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time,  
And stay with you here tonight (with you tonight, with you tonight)  
  
I know you feel these are the worst of times. I do believe it's true.  
When people lock their doors, and hide inside.  
Rumor has it it's the end of Paradise.  
  
But I know, if the world just passed us by, baby I know  
I wouldn't have to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
The best of times, are when I'm alone with you.  
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two.  
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime  
We'll take the best forget the rest and some day we'll find  
  
These are the best of times  
These are the best of times  
  
The headlines read "These Are The Worst Of Times", I do believe it's true.  
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide.  
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise.  
  
But I know, if the world turned upside down, baby I know  
You'd always be around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(When I'm alone with you, you brighten up the night! )  
(When I'm alone with you...)
