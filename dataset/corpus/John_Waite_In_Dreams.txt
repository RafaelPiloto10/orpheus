In my life I've seen such things  
That I wish I had not seen  
But through your eyes  
I can let it go  
When you're lying here with me  
Sunshine knocking on my window  
Couldn't wake me from this dream  
(We dream)  
Cause baby  
anywhere the wind blows  
I will follow you  
It seems  
That in my life  
I still believe in dreams  
Where you are is where I'll be  
It's all that really matters to me  
The world out there  
Hey can kiss my ass  
As long as I've got you I'm free  
Free  
Sunshine knocking on my window  
Couldn't wake me from this dream (we dream)  
Cause baby anywhere the wind blows  
I will follow you  
It seems  
That in my life  
I still believe in dreams  
The world out there can kiss my ass  
As long as I've got you I'm free  
Free  
Sunshine knocking on my window  
Couldn't wake me from this dream (we dream)  
Cause I don't care which way the wind blows  
I will follow you  
It seems  
That in my life  
Cause in your life  
You believe  
In dreams
