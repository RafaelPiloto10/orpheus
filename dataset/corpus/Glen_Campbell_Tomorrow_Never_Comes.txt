Oh you tell me that you love me  
Yes you tell me that you care  
That tomorrow we'll be married  
But tomorrow's never there  
Many weeks have I waited  
Many many long nights have I cried  
Just to see that happy morning happy morning  
When I'd have you right by my side  
But tomorrow it never never comes  
No no no tomorrow ain't never ever gonna come  
Now you tell me you tell me you love me  
Can you say that you want me  
But tomorrow never comes
