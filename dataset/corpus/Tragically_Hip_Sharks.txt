Sharks don't attack the Irish,  
It's mostly Australians.  
There's nothing accomplished  
By these splashing citizens.  
From the Moon down to the surface  
Of the Mariana's Trench  
I won't send you in a cab when  
I can take you there myself then steal a look  
Over your shoulder at  
The distant lights of your firmament.  
  
When the sharks finished the Irish  
And those people from Berlin.  
We left our look of the landed  
With one of rescue's imminent  
From the Moon down to the surface  
Of the Mariana's Trench  
I won't send you in a cab when  
I can take you there myself then steal a look  
Over your shoulder at  
The chandeliers of your firmament.  
It's your firmament, baby.
