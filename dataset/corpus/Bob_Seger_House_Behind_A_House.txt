There's a house behind a house  
There's a dream behind a dream  
There's a heart outside a heart  
There's a hope behind a hope  
  
When two people know that it's time to go  
When do they give in  
At what point in time do they really find  
They must let it end  
  
Lonely faces everywhere  
Watch them starin' at their hands  
As the walls keep closin' in  
As the days go on and on  
  
When two people see it can never be  
When do they give up  
When do they concede they must let it be  
Now they've had enough They've had enough  
  
Lonely faces everywhere  
Watch them starin' at their hands  
There's a house behind a house  
There's a dream behind a dream
