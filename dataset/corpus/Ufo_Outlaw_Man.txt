I came out of the fifties  
Now that's when men were men  
I am like the red red rooster,  
Always couping hens  
I guess that I'm a rarity  
Some call a dying breed  
I am a macho bronco stallion  
Call me Mr Seed  
  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rolling stone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm one big bone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
Motorcycle man  
love don't fit in a can  
  
When you're talking Elvis,  
Well I saw him yesterday  
He touched me on the shoulder  
Asked me if he could play  
I buttered up my ducktail,  
Put on my long black drape  
I polished up my Boneville  
To make those girlies gape  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rolling stone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm one big bone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
Motorcycle man  
love don't fit in a can  
I am one of lifes miracles  
I have my fate in my hands  
I see my colours before me  
I am the outlaw man  
the outlaw man  
Solo  
Jimmy Dean was riding next to me and Steve McQueen  
And we're burning up the street now  
And we're looking pretty mean  
I'm not living in the past  
And I'm not history  
I'm here to set the records straight,  
Unlock this mystery  
  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rolling stone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm one big bone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
Motorcycle man  
love don't fit in a can  
  
I am one of lifes miracles  
I have my fate in my hands  
I see my colours before me  
I am the outlaw man  
  
I am one of lifes miracles  
I have my fate in my hands  
I see my colours before me  
I am the outlaw man  
I'm the outlaw man
