It's quarter to three  
There's no one in the place, except you and me  
So set 'em' up Joe, I've got a little story, you oughta know  
We're drinking my friend to the end of a brief episode  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
  
I got the routine  
So drop another nickel in the machine  
I'm feeling so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad  
I could tell you a lot but you've gotta be true to your code  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
  
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of a poet  
And I've got a lot of things to say  
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to mean  
Until it's talked away  
  
Well, that's how it goes  
And Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close  
So thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind, my bending your ear  
This torch that I found must be drowned or it soon might explode  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road

So thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear  
This torch that I found must be drowned or it soon might explode  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
That long, long road
