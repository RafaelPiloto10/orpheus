Jesus Christ  
Pain  
Take one  
Yeah! Pain  
  
Last time I saw you, I was holding your hand  
And I couldn't wait for you to leave  
I knew right then that it was over and done  
And I couldn't believe that I was free  
  
Help me now, I'm going down  
And I don't know if I'll be ok  
I'll be around, I'll be in town  
If you need a place to stay  
  
When the wind blows and there's a chill in the air  
I hope that someone is taking care of you  
I'm alright, yeah, I'm really ok  
Just so you know I'm always there for you  
  
Help me now, I'm going down  
And I don't know if I'll be ok  
I'll be around, I'll be in town  
If you need a place to stay  
  
(This is Happy Birthday...  
Happy Birthday to you, happy Birthday to you,  
Happy Birthday dear Aaron, happy Birthday to you...  
You're no longer only just a teenager, you're a full-grown 20...)
