Oh it's been too many times and I can't go back  
Night bars, guitars, rundown motels like shacks  
What it mounts up to I don't want it at all  
Lost you and I want you today  
  
Love to love to love you  
Misty green and blue  
Love to love to love you  
  
To be something, to be with you  
Don't say that you'll never know  
Love to love to love you  
  
Half the time it could seem funny  
The other half is just too sad  
This west bound moon's they rise and fall  
Lost you and I want you today  
  
To be something, to be near you  
I don't know where I'm going to  
I've tried and I need you to stay
