If you could see me now you'd know how blue I've been  
One look is all you need to see the mood I'm in  
Perhaps when you'd realize I'm still in love with you  
  
If you could see me now you'd find me being raised  
And trying offly hard to make my tears behave  
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you  
  
You happened my way on some memorable day  
A month will be made for a while  
I'll try to smile but can I play the part without my heart  
  
Behind the smile  
The way I feel for you I never could disguise  
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes  
  
I think you'd be mine again  
If you could see the way you captured me  
I'm yours eternally, if you could see now
