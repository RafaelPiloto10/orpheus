I've been runnin' through the night  
Tryin' to reach and hold you tight  
I've been wonderin' just why you stayed away  
But when I reached your home  
I found out that you had gone  
I found out someone had taken you away  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream we've shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now you've said good-bye all I do is cry  
I've been wonderin' just why you went away  
  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream we've shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now you've said good-bye all I do is cry  
I've been wonderin' just why you went away  
Won't you come on back to my side  
Please oh please don't hurt my pride  
Tryin' to get along without you ain't so good  
And if you play along I will say that I was wrong  
'Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should  
'Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should
