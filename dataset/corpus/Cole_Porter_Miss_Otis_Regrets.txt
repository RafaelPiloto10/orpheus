Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
She is sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down in Lover's Lane  
She strayed, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone, madam  
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her love down, madam  
Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail, madam  
They strung her upon the old willow across the way  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
