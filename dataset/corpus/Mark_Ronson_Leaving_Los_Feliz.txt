[Verse 1]  
I'm on the guests list down the Pollsberry Grand  
That hipster doorman, he don't know who I am  
When started and [?] proof I belong, so I pass  
Some bells and bees are like grinding bombs on the walls  
Some never learn to cut the lock from the stores  
Flora's the border between paradise  
I fight on  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm all outta sisters  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm leaving Los Feliz  
  
[Verse 2]  
I close the rumors that are trapped in the past  
My server jeans are more like I'm outta pants  
But I don't wanna go just yet so I suppose I should dance  
The music vibes are looking at you in dread  
Like get a-burning and can never get sad  
And I shoulda pretend that it never will end inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm all outta sisters  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm leaving Los Feliz  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm young enough to know I'm too young to quit  
I'm old enough to wanna get over it  
But yearning is timeless and mine is as deep as the pill  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm all outta sisters  
I'm leaving Los Feliz day after tomorrow  
I'm leaving Los Feliz
