I'm looking to beat hell, looks like I've got to run to be the leader  
As my forces yell, you can hear 'em, can't you hear them  
All the way- we'll go the distance now  
All the way- stand behind me now  
All the way- no turning back  
All the way cause we are together  
  
I'm standin' proud, we're screaming loud, I'll lead the crowd  
Running wild in the streets  
  
A heavy dose of mean, yeah, I'm a lethal combination  
Hear my forces scream, you can see them, can't yo see them  
All the way- we'll go the distance now  
All the way- stand behind me now  
All the way- no turning back  
All the way we are together  
  
I'm standin' proud, we're screaming loud, I'll lead the crowd  
Running wild in the streets
