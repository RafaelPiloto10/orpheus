(Don't say you love me)  
(Strange things that make me die)  
(Don't say you love me)  
(Strange things that make me die)  
  
I don't belong I'm still around won't steal you like a radio  
I'm still around I won't be long gonna treat you like an angel  
  
But don't say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance 'till we're high you're shy  
Don't say you'll cry  
  
I told you lies I'm still around won't steal your act my angel  
I won't be long it's still your round or serialize the radio  
  
But don't say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance 'till we're high you're shy  
Don't say (don't say) you'll cry  
  
(What do you say?)  
(What do you say?)  
  
Don't go on I see your eyes I screw you around my angel  
You're still my love it's in your eyes our song is on the radio  
  
But don't say you love me (what do you say?)  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance 'till we're high you're shy  
Don't say you'll cry  
  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you'll cry I'm high  
Don't say you'll cry
