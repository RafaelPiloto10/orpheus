She's out of sync  
And everyone around her  
Knows that something is wrong  
She's out of sync  
She's got all the symptoms  
Of a girl who skipped a beat  
She's out of sync  
A piece of ancient history  
She's a walking mirage  
  
She's out of sync  
She entered through the exit  
And never stopped to think  
She's out of sync she's a half  
Step behind  
She's out of luck her body split from  
Her mind  
She's out of orbit she'll never connect  
She'll run out of time before she accepts  
She's out of sync  
  
She's out of sync (sync)  
She's out of sync (sync)  
She's out of sync  
  
Everybody senses  
There s a distance to keep  
She's out of sync  
And totally committed  
To living in a dark age  
She's out of sync  
Constantly undoing  
What's already been done  
She's out of sync  
Trapped in a silent movie  
And she's on the brink  
She's out of focus  
She's a warp in time  
She's discontinued  
A break in the line
