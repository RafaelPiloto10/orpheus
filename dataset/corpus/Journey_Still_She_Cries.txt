Tears that she kept from me  
Somewhere there's broken dreams  
Where love once used to be  
  
All in a memory  
With time we are forgiven  
In time we will forget  
  
I hear her voice in the night  
Cries of joy  
We were good, good, good,  
I still recall how we'd touch, how we'd fall  
We were good, good, good,  
  
Tears that she kept from me  
Someone she used to be  
Forever yours then suddenly  
One kiss she can't remember  
  
I wish I could forget  
I hear her voice in the night, cries of joy  
We were good, good, good,  
I still recall how we'd touch, how we'd fall  
We were good, good, good,  
  
Still she cries  
Somewhere, still she cries  
No one knows when lovers will walk away  
  
I hear her voice, in the night  
Cries of joy,  
We were good, good, good,  
  
All in a memory  
Where our love once used to be  
Good, good,
