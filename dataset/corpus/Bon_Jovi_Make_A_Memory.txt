Hello again, it's you and me  
Kinda always like it used to be  
Sippin' wine, killin' time  
Tryin' to solve life's mysteries  
  
How's your life? It's been a while  
God, it's good to see you smile  
I see you reaching for your keys  
Looking for a reason, not to leave  
  
If you don't know if you should stay  
If you don't say what's on your mind  
Baby, just breathe  
There's nowhere else tonight we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
I dug up this old photograph  
Look at all that hair we had  
It's bittersweet to hear you laugh  
Your phone is ringing, I don't wanna ask  
  
If you go now, I'll understand  
If you stay, hey, I've got a plan  
We're gonna make a memory  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
If you don't know if you should stay  
And you don't say what's on your mind  
Baby, just breathe  
There's nowhere else tonight we should be, we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
You wanna make a memory
