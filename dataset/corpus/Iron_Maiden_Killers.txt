You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back  
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs  
  
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise  
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night  
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed  
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me  
  
I can see what a knife's meant to be  
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see  
  
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties  
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs  
  
Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night  
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light  
I have found you, and now there is no place to run  
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?  
Oh yeah, I've done it  
Yeah  
  
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back  
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs  
Oh look out, I'm coming for you
