Why can't you ever back down?  
Why can't you just shut your face?  
Oh God, the feelings I feel  
Would get me thrown in a cage.  
You're the one who's always screaming at me,  
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free.  
What the fuck more do you want me to be?  
Why must you do this to me?  
  
Run away, I can't stay.  
Lead the way, make them pay.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.  
  
You see the pain in my face  
While you keep putting me down.  
Inside the rage starts to build,  
You push me, I won't go down.  
You're the one who's always screaming at me,  
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free.  
What the fuck more do you want me to be?  
Why must you do this to me?  
  
Run away, I can't stay.  
Lead the way, make them pay.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.  
  
Could it really be the day, today?  
Could this really make the problems go away?  
I'm going to hurt just not in time.  
  
Right now  
I'm taking all I can now.  
Right now  
You've torn us all apart.  
Right now  
There is nothing you can do to stop me.  
Right now, right now, right now, right now,  
Right now, right now, right now, right now,  
Right.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.
