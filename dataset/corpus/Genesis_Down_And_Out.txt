It's good to be here! How've you been?  
Check my bags, boy! Where's my room?  
I sit on the phone, that's my game,  
Keep up the pressure all the way!  
  
I don't want to beat about the bush  
But none of us are getting any younger.  
There's people out there who could take your place.  
A more commercial view! A fresher face!  
  
I need a shower, take a nap  
I'll meet you in the bar, we must have a rap.  
There's a lot on the line, a lot to say.  
There's something I must tell you today.  
  
You and I both know the score,  
You can't go on like this forever.  
So it's with regret that I tell you now  
That from this moment on,  
You're on your own!  
  
I don't talk round corners, it's right between the eyes  
If you're slow they'll run past you,  
Stand tall, see them falling over.  
I walk a straight line, it's right between the eyes.  
Well show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better.  
  
The drinks are on me, be my guest.  
Smoke a cigar? Take the best.  
Don't hedge your bets, we can make a deal,  
You got it in your pocket, how do you feel?  
  
So glad that's over, now you know,  
But I'm only acting under orders.  
And looking down on you from way up here.  
You've got to sink or swim, get off the floor!  
  
I don't talk round corners, it's right between the eyes  
If you're slow they'll run past you,  
Stand tall, see them falling over,  
I walk a straight line, right between the eyes.  
Well show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better.
