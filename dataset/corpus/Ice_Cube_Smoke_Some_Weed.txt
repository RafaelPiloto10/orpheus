[Ice Cube]  
Ice Cube motherfucker  
West coast motherfucker  
  
George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton  
Chris Farley, Chris Rock, Bob Marley  
Rick James, knew how to throw a party  
"Smoke some weed!"  
Snoop Dogg, all the way to Cheech and Chong  
Cypress Hill, Robert Downey hit the bong  
Ricky Williams, fuck how Miami feeling  
"Smoke some weed!"  
  
[Chorus: Ice Cube]  
This is West coast nigga thinking  
California quicksand got a nigga sinking  
I can give a fuck what you niggas drinking  
"Smoke some weed!"  
This is West coast nigga thinking  
California quicksand got a nigga sinking  
I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking  
"Smoke some weed!"  
  
[Ice Cube]  
If you a baller, nigga I'm a hall of famer  
Lion tamer, with two fo'-fifth flamers  
Understand, that yo' life's in danger  
Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers  
Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler  
Have a banger, calling for the Lone Ranger  
Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers  
I'm a nigga, that wanna bone T'Penga  
G4, pull it up out the hanger  
A lil' something, to fuel you niggas anger  
The swine, I'm your face rearranger  
In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger  
Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Springer  
I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer  
I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya  
Police, still get the middle finger  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Lil' niggas, don't try this at home  
Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone  
Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome  
Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown  
Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne  
With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown  
Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone  
Go back to Africa used to be a theme song  
I'm in the zone, do anybody got a zone  
I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone  
You'se a clone, who don't know the shit you on  
Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone  
I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron  
You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone  
Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home  
Gorilla niggas, here come King Kong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ice Cube]  
Ice Cube motherfucker  
West coast motherfucker  
"Smoke some weed!"
