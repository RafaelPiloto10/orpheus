Johnny went to frosted flake  
To go for a walk in the frozen wood  
He bumped into a mushroom  
That sold his body for some warm food  
"Eat me my friend, you'll be the leader of the band"  
Johnny's hand reached out  
Luckily there was Mr Doubt  
Mr Doubt the old man was the surveyor  
Of frosted flake wood  
He tried to sell hesitation wherever he could  
"Buy some doubt"  
Feel free he yelled loud  
"Friends it won't hurt"  
Luckily there was big bird  
For God's sake run away  
Or it won't be your lucky day  
Leave this forest behind  
This ain't a place for human kind
