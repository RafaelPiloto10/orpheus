I got wings, I got arms, I got shrinks  
I got bombs, I got guns, I got brains  
So there's no point in your warbird  
She's no point in denying  
I got guns, I got bombs, I got brains  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
Take me up to a warmer place  
I got eggs, I got feathers, I got brains  
And there's no point in your warbird  
She's no point in denying  
I got guns, I got bombs, I got brains  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
For you, for you  
Or you  
I got brains, I got feathers, I got hands  
I got friends, I got ammo, I got plans  
So there's no point in your warbird  
She's no point in denying  
I got guns, I got arms, I got plans  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fly for you
