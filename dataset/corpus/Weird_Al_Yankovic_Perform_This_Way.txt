My mama told me when I was hatched  
Act like a superstar  
Save your allowance, buy a bubble dress  
And someday you will go far  
Now on red carpets, well, I'm hard to miss  
The press follows everywhere I go  
I'll poke your eye out with a dress like this  
Back off and enjoy the show!  
  
I'm sure my critics will say it's a grotesque display  
Well they can bite me, baby, I perform this way  
I might be wearin' Swiss cheese or maybe covered with bees  
It doesn't mean I'm crazy, I perform this way ('from this way)  
  
Ooh, my little monsters pay lots 'cause I perform this way  
Baby, I perform this way (perform this way)  
Ooh, don't worry, I'm okay, hey, I just perform this way  
I'm not crazy, I perform this way  
  
I'll be a troll or evil queen  
I'll be a human jelly bean  
'Cause every day is Halloween for me  
  
I'm so completely original  
My new look is all the rage  
I'll wrap my small intestines 'round my neck  
And set fire to myself on stage  
I'll wear a porcupine on my head  
On a W-H-I-M  
And for no reason now I'll sing in French  
Excusez-moi, qui a PT (express yourself)  
  
Got my straight jacket today, its made of gold lame  
No, not because I'm crazy, I perform this way  
I strap prime rib to my feet, cover myself with raw meat  
I'll bet you've never seen a skirt steak worn this way  
  
Don't be offended when you see  
My latest pop monstrosity  
I'm strange, weird, shocking, odd, bizarre  
I'm Frankenstein, I'm Avatar  
There's nothing too embarrassing  
I'll honestly do anything  
But wear white after Labor Day  
'Cause baby, I perform this way  
  
Hope you won't think it's cliche if I go nude today  
Don't call the cops, now, baby, I perform this way  
No reason I should regret all the attention I get  
I'm not completely crazy, I perform this way, yeah  
  
I perform this way-hey, I perform this way-hey  
I'm always deviating from the norm this way-hey  
I perform this way-hey, I perform this way-hey  
I'm really not insane, I just perform this way-hey
