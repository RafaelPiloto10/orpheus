Lay down your head  
And look to your window  
Where do you go  
When it's not where you're going?  
And how do you see  
When the light isn't shining?  
Where you could be  
If you worked out the timing  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
  
If I were a king  
And you were a lady  
What would I sing  
To say what I'm saying?  
And would you believe  
The verses left open?  
The heart on my sleeve  
The rhyming all broken  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
  
Sell me a river  
And I'll skate away  
To the downstream  
Where I did play  
So easy minded  
Like a hill on the skyline  
Tripped up and blinded  
Getting lost on the sidelines  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?  
And how do you do the things you do to you?
