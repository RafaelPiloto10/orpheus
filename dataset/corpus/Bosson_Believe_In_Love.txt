I'm holding you tight  
I feel that you're close but yet so far  
Say what's on your mind  
Cause sometimes I wonder where you are  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
I'll always be there watching out for you  
Just tell me the truth cause  
I think that we both deserve to know...  
  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If you want someone  
Just let them know  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If I'm not the one  
Just let me know...  
  
Oh oh  
Just let me know  
Oh oh  
Just let me know  
  
So open your heart  
Or give me the key that I'm looking for  
I'm falling apart  
So please let me in through that secret door  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
I'll always be there watching out for you  
Just tell me the truth cause  
I think that we both deserve to know  
  
If you believe in love...  
Then let it show  
If you want someone  
Just let them know  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If I'm not the one  
Just let me know...  
  
Oh oh...  
Just let me know  
Oh oh  
Just let me know  
  
All I want is for you to understand  
This crazy battle going on inside this man  
Don't let our love, just slip right through our hands...  
Oh oh  
  
If you believe in love...  
Then let it show  
If you want someone  
Just let them know  
If you believe in love  
Then let it show  
If I'm not the one  
Just let me know...
