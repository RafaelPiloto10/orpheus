(Lainie Marsh)  
I hear the clock a tickin'  
See the sweat upon my brow  
I know my destination  
Nothing's gonna stop me now  
I'm running on desire  
Baby I've got nerves of steel  
Coming down to the wire  
Lord above me guide the wheel  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
I'll be weary upon that road  
I know the finish line's in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
There's a junkyard dog a barkin'  
In the valley down below  
He's wanting me to stop and  
Gather up a heavy load  
Ain't gonna heed his call  
Ain't givin' him the time of day  
You mangy mutt once and for all  
I said I threw that stuff away  
I won't have a bit of trouble  
Heading down the straight and true  
I'll fly solo on the double  
Into the yonder blue  
I might need some intervention  
Out upon the icy turn  
In a foggy situation  
Squealin' on a hairpin curve  
I'm running on desire  
Baby I've got nerves of steel  
Coming down to the wire  
Lord above me guide the wheel  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
I'll be weary upon that road  
I know the finish line's in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
I'll be weary upon that road  
I know the finish line's in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Got a ways to go, got a ways to go
