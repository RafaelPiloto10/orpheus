You lead me on the path  
Keep showing me the way  
I feel a little lost  
A little strange today  
  
I think I'll take a hold  
Of whatever comes my way  
Then we'll see what happens  
Take it day by day  
  
I thought I had it all  
I had it all worked out  
Just what my future held  
That there would be no doubt  
  
But then the card came up  
And I took another turn  
But I don't know if it's  
Fulfillment that I yearn  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
To view the world  
  
I would like you to know  
When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Don't want to be here  
Somewhere I'd rather be  
But when I get there  
I might find it's not for me  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
To view the world  
  
I would like you to know  
When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
  
to view the world  
I would like you to know  
When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Don't wanna be here  
Somewhere I'd rather be  
But when I get there  
I might find it's not for me  
  
Don't know what I want  
Or where I want to be  
I'm feeling more confused  
The more the days go by
