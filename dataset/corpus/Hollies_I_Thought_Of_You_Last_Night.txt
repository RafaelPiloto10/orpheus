I thought of you last night  
I thought of you and thought of you  
Until the morning light  
I couldn't sleep, I couldn't sleep last night  
  
I wanted you last night  
I wanted you and wanted you  
And wished with all my might  
You'd come to me, you'd come to me last night  
  
Darling, my darling, I can't live without you  
I'm lonely, so lonely when you're out of sight  
  
I'll wait for tonight  
I'll wait for you and wait for you  
And long to hold you tight  
Bring your love to me, your love to me tonight  
  
I'll wait for tonight  
I'll wait for you and wait for you  
And long to hold you tight  
Bring your love to me, your love to me tonight  
Bring your love to me, your love to me tonight
