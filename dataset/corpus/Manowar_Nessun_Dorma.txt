No One Sleeps, No One Sleeps  
Even You, O Princess,  
In Your Cold Room,  
Watch The Stars,  
That Tremble With Love  
And With Hope.  
But My Secret Is Closed Within Me,  
My Name No One Shall Know, No, No,  
On Your Mouth I Will Reveal It  
When The Light Shines,  
And My Kiss Will Dissolve The Silence  
That Makes You Mine.  
Vanish, O Night!  
Set, Stars!  
Set, Stars!  
At Dawn, I Shall Conquer!  
I Shall Win!  
I Shall Win!
