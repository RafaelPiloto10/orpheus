When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide  
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride  
Get to the bottom and I see you again  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Do you, don't you want me to love you ?  
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Do you, don't you want me to make you ?  
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Look out  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter
