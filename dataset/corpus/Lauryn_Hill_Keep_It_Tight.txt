As I span the cosmos (The cosmos)  
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound (Sound)  
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground (Unh!)  
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants

At the Apollo, I played the shepherd sheep followed (Sheep followed)  
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra [(Like I'm Tyra) Pause] Banks

Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious (Act religiouus)  
Street academics, seen a lot of girls mimic (Huh)  
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick (You can tell!)  
L slang-bangs (Slang-bang!) like a dub plate (Bing!)  
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates! (Mash up your...)  
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail  
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever (Whenever, Wherever, Whatever! - Singing)  
Like Maxwell (Unh)  
My pentium, makes more chips than Intel (Intel)  
I didn't mean to turn you on (I didn't mean to turn you on!)  
Like Sherell! ( Uh Huh)  
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid, Anthony  
Not even fantasy can surpass it (Unh, unh!)  
Once you blast it one starts to feel kinky  
I think thee, goes by the name of Young Slinky  
And just when you thought it was safe to relax (Safe to relax!)  
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax! ( Perfect syntax!)  
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax (What?)...

like I hear you late at night?  
Chance to hear you (In the morning)  
Amp the party  
DJ Skribble Keep It Tight!  
(Can I see you?)  
Just a short time in the morning  
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning!)  
Chance to hear you  
Amp the party  
DJ Skribble Keep It Tight!  
  
Can I hear you in the morning (Can I see you?)  
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning!)  
Chance to hear you  
Amp the party
