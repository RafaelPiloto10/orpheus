The air attack warning sounds like.  
This is the sound.  
When you hear the air attack warning, You and your family must take cover  
  
Love's gone, oh  
  
When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
(Score no more, score no more)  
When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
(Workin' for the black mask)

Comrad number one  
A born again poor man's son  
(Poor man's son)  
On the air America  
I modeled shirts for Van Heusen

Switch up your shield  
Switch up and feel  
I'm walkin' out, lover hey  
I'm givin' you back a good time  
I'm shippin' out, out  
I'm workin' for the black mask  
  
Tell the world that you're winning  
Nothin' life, nothin' life  
  
Listen to the voice sayin' follow me (x2)  
  
When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
When two tribes go to war  
One is all that you can score  
  
You've got two tribes

Somethin' this good died

Horror are the new gods?)

One point is all that you can score
