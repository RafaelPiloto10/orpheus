Wake up baby look around  
Birds sing, ooh that sound  
Reminds me of a line  
From "Unchained Melody"  
  
Feel like I'm a little girl  
Best thing in the whole wide world  
Is I can see the makings of a memory  
I remember how it used to be  
Well I'm still dreaming  
  
Cause I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things  
  
Ain't nothing like a sunny day  
Chit-chat at a street cafe  
Just paint the picture, baby  
Where you want to be  
  
Take a walk, take a ride  
So far, you and I  
Don't need a plan  
But we can share  
This revelry  
  
I remember how I used to want it all  
Funny how the big things seem so small  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things  
  
Through all the days  
The blues, the grays  
A ray of light keeps shining  
  
I believe in simple things  
Through all the days  
The blues, the grays  
A ray of light was shining  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
  
I believe in simple things  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things
