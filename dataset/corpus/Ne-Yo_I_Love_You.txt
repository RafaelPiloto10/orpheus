[Verse:]  
I look away  
When you try to look in my eyes  
Cuz I'm afraid  
That I may scare you with what's inside  
I try not to be so  
Damn obviously overcome  
When you smile at me  
I try not to care that  
You've become the air in my lungs  
That I live to breathe  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid to say  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid  
I love you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Now until then  
I don't care far away it is  
When all I fear  
This love will simply say it's not over again  
I just can't believe how  
Scared I used to be to say  
What you are to me  
I would surely die if  
You were ever to fly away  
Cuz I live to breathe you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid to say  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid  
I love you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
And it feels so good to say it aloud  
I love you  
I love you  
Wherever you go  
Baby you know  
Right here  
And right now  
I love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid to say  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid  
I love you
