One night as I rolled down some long winding road  
I saw you and I knew I couldn't let you go  
Half child and all woman, vision fantasy  
Lost against the moonlight bathed in ecstasy  
Leopard's skin and cat's eyes  
Has the jungle made you wild  
The prey you're after, is you faster  
Will it make you smile  
Ride with me, I'll set you free  
Chains can't hold us down  
I need you, if you want me  
Lovers we are bound  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
Sweet cheetah, cheetah  
I love it when your claws run through me  
Fever, fever, I love it, babe  
Come do it to me  
Cheetah, cheetah  
I love it when your claws run through me  
Fever, fever, I love it, babe  
Come do it to me now  
  
Skin tight you move in so slowly to thrill  
Waiting for the nightmare then you're in for the kill  
Amazon so sleekly you know what to do  
Eat the flesh, and save my heart  
And leave it when you're through  
Pain and pleasures all mine  
Untamed and running wild  
Sink your teeth into me  
Lick your lips and smile  
Take my hand and ride the land  
Forever you and me  
Hold on tight to me all night  
And set your spirit free  
  
[REFRAIN:]
