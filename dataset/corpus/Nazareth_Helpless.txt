There is a town in north Ontario  
Dream comfort memory despair  
And in my mind I still need a place to hide  
All my changes were there  
Blue blue windows behind the stars  
Yellow moon on the rise  
Big birds flying across the skies  
Casting shadows in our eyes  
Leave us helpless helpless helpless helpless  
Helpless helpless they leave me now  
Helpless helpless helpless  
Blue blue windows behind the stars  
Yellow moon on the rise  
They leave us  
Helpless helpless helpless helpless  
Helpless helpless they leave me now  
Helpless helpless helpless  
Helpless helpless helpless helpless  
Helpless helpless they leave me now
