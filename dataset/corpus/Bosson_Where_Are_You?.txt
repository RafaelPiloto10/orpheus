Some meet in the strangest places  
Some meet in the place that they work in  
Some meet in their own backyard  
  
Some say it was love at first sight  
Some say that they never could imagine  
Some say that they'd find the right one  
  
Chorus  
Where are you?  
When I'm calling your name, oh baby  
Where are you?  
When I'm here all alone, where are you?  
Where are you?  
When I reach out my hand, oh baby  
Where are you when I need you most, oh baby  
Where are you?  
  
Some meet at the supermarket  
Some meet on the summer vacation  
Some meet at the local bar  
  
Some say it was meant to be them  
Some say they've been waiting for a long time  
Some say that they found the right one  
  
Some meet cause they like each other  
Some meet for a little bit of lovin'  
Some meet in their father's car  
  
Some say they're getting married  
Some believe in trust and understanding  
They say that they find the right one  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
There is this one song I can't stop in my head  
And I keep on going on and it's makin' me stronger  
One song I can't stop in my head  
And it makes me feel good so I can hold on much longer  
Repeat  
  
Chorus
