I never saw the world lookin' so bright  
Never saw the wheels turnin' so right  
And I'm glad to be ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
I'm just like a kid on a merry-go-round  
I'm so high in the clouds, I hope I never come down  
And I'm glad that I'm ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Our train don't carry the blues  
No room for hurtin' or any bad news  
Our train is just loaded with love  
Just you and I, and that's enough  
  
It just keeps a-chuggin' on down the track  
We're so in love, we don't want to look back  
Aren't you glad that we're ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
I see our destination just over the hill  
Cozy little place that they call Arborsville  
Aren't you glad to be ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
The wheels sing the song as they roll down the track  
They seem to say I love you with each clickety-clack  
Aren't you glad that we're ridin'  
This crazy little train of love  
  
Our train don't carry the blues  
No room for hurtin' or any bad news  
Our train is just loaded with love  
Just you and I, and that's enough  
  
It just keeps a-chuggin' on down the track  
We're so in love, we don't want to look back  
Aren't you glad that we're ridin'  
This crazy little train of love
