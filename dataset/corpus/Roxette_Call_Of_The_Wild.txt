I know her,  
And every notion I get from her  
I wear inside me.  
I know her,  
  
All of the broken leaves of love  
She leaves behind.  
Oh - don't you hide away from the rain.  
Oh - can you tell me the name of this game?  
  
I got to get through to you.  
Behind the door,  
Another wall,  
A lonely cry a call of the wild.  
  
A dancing daze,  
An empty face,  
A crystal high a call of the wild.  
And there is something that sweeps the dark,  
  
A lover's dart,  
The call of a broken heart.  
Wrapped in the night,  
Behind these eyes,  
  
Oh hear the cry,  
A call of the wild.  
I know her  
And in my mind I dream of her,  
  
How she aches without me.  
I know her  
And every heart is a lonely hunter  
When she walks by.  
  
Oh - can you read the hurt in my eyes?  
Oh - don't you leave without saying goodbye.  
I got to get through to you.  
Behind the door,  
  
Another wall
