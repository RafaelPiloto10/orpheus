I'll take you to the picture show and babe I'll hold your hand  
I'll sit up in your parlor, let you cool me with your fan  
I'll listen to your troubles and pet you when you cry  
But get that marryin' out of your head, it'll be a bachelor 'til I die  
I don't mind honky tonkin' 'round if that will bring you fun  
But somehow I can't understand how one and one make one  
I like to cuddle near you and listen to you lie  
But get that marryin' out of your head, it'll be a bachelor 'til I die  
Now if you want a helpmate, you're wastin' lots of time  
'Cause I'm afraid of church bells, how they scare me when they chime  
I've seen those married people just up and say goodbye  
So get that marryin' out of your head, it'll be a bachelor 'til I die  
This freedom's mighty precious in this land of liberty  
I've seen what matrimony done to better men than me  
I don't mind keepin' company with the apple of my eye  
But keep that marryin' out of your head, it'll be a bachelor 'til I die
