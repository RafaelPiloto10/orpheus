I loved real, real hard once  
But the love wasn't returned  
Found out the man I'd die for  
He wasn't even concerned  
I tried, and I tried, and I tried  
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)  
I cried, and I cried, and I cried  
But I couldn't make it right  
  
But I, I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then you'd understand  
  
That what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)  
(if you don't catch it)  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it (if you just let it)  
If you just let it (if you just let it)  
  
See, I thought this feeling  
It was all that I had  
But how could this be love  
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)  
Gave up my power  
I existed for you  
But who-ever knew  
The voo-doo you'd do  
  
But I, I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then you'd understand  
  
What you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)  
(if you don't, you don't)  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)  
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)  
  
See what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)  
(if you don't, you don't)  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it  
If you just let it
