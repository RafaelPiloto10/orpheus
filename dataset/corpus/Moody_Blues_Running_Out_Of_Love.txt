Some days you're gonna put me on hold,  
Some days you're gonna put me  
On a pedestal up high.  
I don't know if it's me,  
I don't know if it's you,  
I don't know if it's both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
And when it comes to taking my calls  
There's something more between us  
Than a telephone line.  
I can't believe it's me,  
I can't believe it's you,  
I can't believe it's both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love  
  
Can't think of how we lost our way.  
Some days I feel  
I'm getting very close to you.  
Can't think of how the story ends,  
Can't hear the words  
I really want to hear from you.  
We're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love  
  
Some people like to put you on hold,  
Some people like to put you  
On a pedestal up high.  
I don't know if it's me,  
I don't know if it's you,  
I don't know if it's both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
  
Can't believe we're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love.
