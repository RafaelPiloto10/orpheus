[Chorus]  
You've been down for me  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And you've been riding for me girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
I knew you had my back girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And I love you for that, you're  
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty  
  
[Verse 1]  
First off, baby that's loyal, most of these girls ain't royal  
And that's why you know I'm gon' spoil and I'd do anything for you  
Need your hair done, I'd fix it, want a new bag, I'd get it  
Girl you look good, let me kiss you, I wanna spend this money up with you  
Pop a couple bands for the rent, take it, that's money well spent  
That's for all the money you spent, that's for all the money you lent me girl  
Everything that I been through, I ain't 'bout act brand new  
Real friends, only got a few and real talking, baby, you the truth  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, if you ask me if I got you, you know what the answer is  
You know it girl  
Girl you damn right, damn right, damn right, damn right  
  
[Chorus]  
You've been down for me  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And you've been riding for me girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
I knew you had my back girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And I love you for that, you're  
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby I can tell your future, drop top, girl let me scoop you (scoop you up)  
And I don't wanna ever, ever lose you, real chick, baby, I salute you  
Everything that I been through, I ain't 'bout act brand new  
Real friends, only got a few and real talking, baby, you the truth  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, if you ask me if I got you, you know what the answer is  
You know it girl  
Girl you damn right, damn right, damn right, damn right  
  
[Chorus]  
You've been down for me  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And you've been riding for me girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
I knew you had my back girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And I love you for that, you're  
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty  
  
[Verse 3]  
You are the reason why I don't fuck with you niggas  
Only the homies from day one  
Call up my baby cause we ain't talk in a minute  
Name saved as bae in my phone  
Give her a minute, when she come over we kissing  
She my day one, only one better than all my bitches  
Pussy too good when I bang I'm on a mission  
Body to body when we changing up positions  
I'm like a prodigal, I pick her like eeny meeny miney mo  
Hop out the plane like Geronimo, I lock her down like Guantanamo  
I give that pussy a taste, put that shit all in my face  
She likes the Codeine and the J, baby girl all I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
You've been down for me  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And you've been riding for me girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
I knew you had my back girl  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And I love you for that, you're  
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty
