Hi there  
Should I've asked you what's your name?  
Should you've asked me the same?  
But dig  
Let's not be wasting our time  
Let's not lead each other blind  
If you don't want me  
My heart can't strain, yeah, another time  
  
There's only twenty four hours in a day  
And that don't leave much time to play  
I don't dig that no way, honey  
Coz my heart can't take it, no, another day  
Listen to me honey  
  
I've been told by many different girls  
'Otis I love you, oh boy'  
They tell me this from the bottom of their soul  
But they didn't mean it  
Listen, I  
  
I've been let down, yo  
Hit the ground  
And called the biggest, the biggest fool  
Biggest fool ever walked on this ground  
Listen  
  
I can't stand it, no no no no,  
To be built up, way on up, and let down  
Being loved, yo, is home in my mind  
I don't like that  
I like for it to be from the heart  
  
And I found out later on I was wasting my time  
Just a waste of time yeah  
  
Somebody understand what I'm saying  
What I say  
It's just a waste of time  
  
If you don't want me mama  
Don't just leave me hanging  
Don't just let me waste my time, no no  
  
Somebody  
Somebody gotta get the message to me  
No I don't wanna
