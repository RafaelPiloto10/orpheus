I know it's over before she says  
I know the falls that the water face  
I know it's over  
An ocean that waits for a storm  
The sun on snow, rivers in rain  
Crystal ball can foresee a change  
  
And I know it's over, a parting of ways  
And it's done  
But didn't we have fun?  
Don't say it was all a waste  
Didn't we have fun?  
  
From the top of the world, the top of the waves  
We said forever, forever always  
  
We could have been lost, we would have been saved  
Now we're stopping the world, stopping it's spin  
Come on don't give up, don't say we give in  
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done  
Oh, didn't we have fun?  
  
Oh, didn't we have fun?  
  
I know it's over before she says  
Now someone else has taken your place  
'I know it's over' Icarus says to the sun  
  
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes  
And two forces, two forces collide  
And the fight til it's over, fight til it's done  
Oh, didn't we have fun?  
  
Don't say it was all a waste  
Didn't we have fun?  
  
From the top of the world, the top of the waves  
We said forever, forever always  
We could have been lost, we would have been saved  
  
Now we're stopping the world, stopping it in it's tracks  
But nothing's too broken to find a way back  
So before it's over, before you run  
Didn't we have fun?  
  
Cause you and me, we were always meant to, always meant to be  
We were always meant to, always meant to  
You and me, we were always meant to, always meant to be  
  
Oh, didn't we have fun?  
Oh, didn't we have fun?  
But then, maybe we could again
