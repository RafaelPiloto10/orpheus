Ring ring goes your telephone  
You act like you ain't at home  
You shut me out, but it turns me on  
Red lipstick, black dresses  
A look that I should not mess with  
It makes us boys go crazy for you  
  
So fascinated  
I'm anticipating the touch  
That may never come  
  
[Chorus]  
In the rain  
In the sun  
Everybody needs someone  
They can dream of all night long  
All the pain  
And the ways  
That you're driving me insane  
It's no mystery why you're ruling me  
  
We first met in the lunch room  
My ocular nerve went, pop, zoom  
I never observed such a beautiful face  
Sweet lady, don't play me  
If I am a knob, don't fade me  
You can't win the game if you pass the ace  
  
I'm so frustrated  
This love's belated, methinks  
Let's get it to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not kidding anymore  
This love hurts, that's for sure  
I feel you, I see you,  
I need you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's no mystery why you're ruling me
