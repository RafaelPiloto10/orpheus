Before the throne of God above  
I have a strong, a perfect plea  
A great high Priest whose Name is Love  
Who ever lives and pleads for me  
My name is graven on His hands  
My name is written on His heart  
I know that while in heaven He stands  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
No tongue can bid me thence depart  
  
When Satan tempts me to despair  
And tells me of the guilt within  
Upward I look and see Him there  
Who made an end to all my sin  
Because the sinless Savior died  
My sinful soul is counted free  
For God the just is satisfied  
To look on Him and pardon me  
To look on Him and pardon me  
  
Behold Him there the risen Lamb  
My perfect spotless righteousness  
The great unchangeable I am  
The King of glory and of grace  
One with Himself I cannot die  
My soul is purchased by His blood  
My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God!  
With Christ my Savior and my God!  
  
One with Himself I cannot die  
My soul is purchased by His blood  
My life is hid with Christ on high  
With Christ my Savior and my God!  
With Christ my Savior and my God!
