You walk away from me tonight  
Not knowing the real me  
Cuz you believe in all the hype  
I just took down the magazine  
Take away the glamour  
The world let it show  
And forget everything you know  
Take away the mirrors, the limos, the lights  
Cuz I don't wanna dress up tonight  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna walk outta here into the street  
Would you put up resistance  
Would it make a difference  
Would you know the real me  
Me and my old blue jeans  
  
You think I'm unnaproachable  
Bet I don't feel enough  
Should read a book cover to cover  
And not be so quick to judge  
Take away the glamour, the make up, the clothes  
And forget everything you know  
Take away the ego, the trick of the light  
Cuz I don't wanna dress up tonight  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna walk outta here into the street  
Would you put up resistance  
Would it make a difference  
Would you know the real me  
Me and my old blue jeans  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna walk outta here into the street  
Would you put up resistance  
Would it make a difference  
Would you know the real me  
Me and my old blue jeans  
  
I wanna show you what you get  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna walk outta here into the street  
Would you put up resistance  
Would it make a difference  
Would you know the real me  
Me and my old blue jeans  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna walk out of here into the street  
Would you put up resistance  
Would it make a difference  
Would you know the real me  
Me and my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans  
I'm gonna walk outta here into the street  
Would you put up resistance  
Would it make a difference  
Would you know the real me  
Me and my old blue jeans
