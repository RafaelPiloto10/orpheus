Over time I've come to feel  
That everything must come apart it seems  
From the little child to the man of power  
From the beggar to the angel of my dreams  
From the thinnest thread we are sewn together  
From the finest string we dangle over time  
From the highest wire do we walk through fire  
Should our balance ever falter  
Should our steps be unaligned  
Such a big storm yeah such a strong wind blowing  
Such a loud voice calling for me to cross the line  
  
Chorus  
But I'm not gonna give up the ghost  
No, not gonna give up the ghost  
I'm not gonna give up the ghost, no not gonna give it up  
'Cause I haven't the strength to hold out too long  
If we both hold on together we can make each other strong  
  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh  
  
Drop the mask take away the house  
And forget about the income and the car  
We're all the same underneath our shell  
We've all been to hell and we know what it's like  
And we've shared each other's sins  
We all know what it's like to give up the fight  
We've all been ashamed at one time or another  
We all have dreams and nightmares too  
  
When it all comes down we'll look out for each other  
(No one else will)  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
He's gonna have to fight me first  
  
Chorus  
  
Every cloud has a silver lining  
And every soul is tender to the touch  
We are made of stone, we are made of steel  
And we're all the same when we return to dust  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
He's gonna have to fight me first. ..  
  
Chorus out
