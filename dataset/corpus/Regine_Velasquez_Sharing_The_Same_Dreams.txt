We found each other  
But little did we know  
That in truth, my sisters  
Togetherness can make love grow  
We're always better together  
Than when we're apart  
We're sharing the same dreams in our hearts  
We're sharin'  
Sharin' the same dreams  
Yes! You and me  
And good things  
Good things will happen  
If we wait, wait and see  
We'll make it together  
Sink or swim  
And neither one of us will be  
Out on alimb  
We're sharin', sharin' the same dreams  
Yes! You and me  
We may be different  
But then that's who we are  
Just remember my sisters  
We're reachin' for that lucky star  
We share the same joy and laughter sadness and tears  
We're stayin' together for years and years.
