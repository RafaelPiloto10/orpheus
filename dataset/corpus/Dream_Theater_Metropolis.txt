The smile of dawn arrived early May  
She carried a gift from her home  
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear  
And of sorrow and pain  
She'll never outgrow  
Death is the first dance, eternal  
  
There's no more freedom  
The both of you will be  
Confined to this mind  
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try  
I was told there's a new love  
That's born for each one that has died  
I was told there'd be no one to  
Call on when I feel alone and afraid  
I was told if you dream of the next world  
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire  
  
As a child, I thought I could  
Live without pain without sorrow  
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me  
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid  
  
Somewhere like a scene from a memory  
There's a picture worth a thousand words  
Eluding stares from faces before me  
It hides away and will never be heard of again  
Deceit is the second without end  
  
The city's cold blood teaches us to survive  
Just keep your heart in my eyes and we'll stay alive  
The third arrives  
  
Before the leaves have fallen  
Before we lock the doors  
There must be the third and last dance  
This one will last forever  
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles  
She's taken you to your home  
  
It can only take a place  
When the struggle between  
Our children has ended  
Now the miracle and the  
Sleeper know that the third is love  
Love is the dance of Eternity
