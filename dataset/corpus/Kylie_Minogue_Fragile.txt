Innocent, that's my way  
Don't know where I am  
Catch my breath, can't think straight  
Got to make a plan  
  
But I get butterflies  
Water in my eyes  
  
'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name  
Fragile when you call  
This could be the nearest thing to love  
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak  
Fragile feeling small  
This could be the closest thing to love  
  
Shake and sweat, wipe my brow  
Scared of what's to come  
Lie awake, toss and turn  
Am I the only one  
  
But I get butterflies  
Water in my eyes  
  
'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name  
Fragile when you call  
This could be the nearest thing to love  
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak  
Fragile feeling small  
This could be the closest thing to love  
  
But I get butterflies  
Water in my eyes  
When I think of you  
I could break in to  
  
'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name  
Fragile when you call  
This could be the nearest thing to love  
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak  
Fragile feeling small  
This could be the closest thing to love
