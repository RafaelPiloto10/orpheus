Load up on guns  
Bring your friends  
It's fun to lose  
And to pretend  
She's over bored  
And self assured  
I know, I know  
A dirty word  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now, entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yah  
  
Hey  
  
Hey  
I'm worse at what I do best  
And for this gift I feel blessed  
Our little group has always been  
And always will until the end  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yah  
  
Hey  
  
Hey  
And I forget just why I taste  
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile  
I found it hard  
It's hard to find  
Oh well, whatever, nevermind  
  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello how low?  
Hello hello hello  
  
With the lights out, it's less dangerous  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now  
Entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
  
A denial(x9)
