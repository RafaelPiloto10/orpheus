Even in the quietest moments  
I wish I knew what I had to do  
And even though the sun is shining  
Well I feel the rain, here it comes again, dear  
And even when you showed me  
My heart was out of tune  
For there's a shadow of doubt that's not letting me find you too soon  
The music that you gave me  
The language of my soul  
Oh Lord, I want to be with you.  
Won't you let me come in from the cold?  
  
Don't you let the sun fade away  
Don't you let the sun fade away  
Don't you let the sun be leaving  
Won't you come to me soon  
  
And even though the stars are listening  
And the ocean's deep, I just go to sleep  
And then I create a silent movie  
You become the star, is that what you are, dear?  
Your whisper tells a secret  
Your laughter brings me joy  
And a wonder of feeling I'm nature's own little boy  
But still the tears keep falling  
They're raining from the sky  
Well there's a lot of me got to go under before I get high  
  
Don't you let the sun disappear  
Don't you let the sun disappear  
Don't you let the sun be leaving  
No, you can't be leaving my life  
Say that you won't be leaving my life  
Say that you won't be leaving my life  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Lord, won't you come and get into my life  
Lord, won't you come and get into my life  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Say won't you please, stay won't you please  
Oh Lord, don't go  
  
And even when the song is over  
Where have I been, was it just a dream?  
And though your door is always open  
Where do I begin, may I please come in, dear?
