It wouldn't take a long time to explain what lies between us  
And it wouldn't take a genius to work out what the scene is  
It might just take a pilot to give you a natural high  
But you're sending off those bottle tops for your free piece of mind  
And are you just waving or drowning?  
It's so hard to tell when you're so far away  
Oh, innocence has passed you by a long, long time ago  
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know  
Your pornographic priestess left you for another guy  
You frighten little children and you always wonder why  
Always wonder why  
The mercury is rising and it's not all that surprising  
In the land of milk and honey where you make big money  
And it always keeps the rain off and it always keeps you dry  
But back home the people hate you and you never did know why  
But I think I'm going to tell you  
Just give me fifty thousand lire for my thoughts  
Oh, innocence has passed you by a long, long time ago  
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know  
The supermarket checkout girl once smacked you in the eye  
When you eat no one else does but you always wonder why  
Always wonder why  
It would take a gunshot just to clear your head awhile  
And after all this time how can you stand there  
Look at me and smile?  
Now are you just waving or drowning?  
It's so hard to tell when you're so far away  
Oh, innocence has passed you by a long, long time ago  
I was the fly upon your wall and I saw what you know  
Degeneration suits you, now I'm going home to cry  
You won't be seeing me again but you'll always wonder why  
Always wonder why
