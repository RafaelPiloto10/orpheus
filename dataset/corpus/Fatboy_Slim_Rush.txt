We're alone, each with our very own lives to lead,  
we carry our walls around in our pockets,  
Electricity crackles and bricks turn to dust,  
when you're there...  
  
I get a rush,  
straight to my head,  
I get a rush.  
I get a rush,  
down to my feet,  
I get a rush.  
  
See you there, standing with a secret smile on your face.  
I am looking at my salvation.  
Heal the broken hearts,  
feed the nation with love...  
  
A rush of wind...of blood through my veins and energy,  
you are here with me now and I love it.  
Take me away...  
Fly with me
