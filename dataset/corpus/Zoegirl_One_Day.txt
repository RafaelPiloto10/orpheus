Everyday is the same old thing,  
Same frustration, same rutine.  
And by the time I realize I haven't taken time to spend with you  
My day is through.  
  
Have a little faith you say  
It'll go a long, long way  
Look up, I'm coming soon.  
Everything I think I need, it all begins to seem  
So small in the Presence of you.  
  
(CHORUS)  
One day,(one day)  
All these words will meet their music.  
One day,(one day)  
All these dreams will come true.  
One day,(one day)  
You'll trade answers for confusion.  
One day,(one day)  
Lord I will be with you one day.  
Ladada, ladada, ladada, one day  
Ladada, ladada, ladada, one day  
  
I look around and I'll I see  
Are selfish people, selfish me.  
Distracted by the things around  
These conversations weigh me down.  
  
Have a little faith you say  
It'll go a long, long way.  
Look up, I'm coming soon.  
Then I'm reminded of  
Everything that you have done  
And I'm caught in the presence of you.  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
When you open up the sky  
I will be free from this shell, and I will fly  
I will see you eye to eye  
  
One day... you will wipe away all the tears  
One day... and all the anger and fear  
One day... you'll hold me for a hundred years  
One day...  
  
(Chorus) (Ladada, ladada, ladada x3)
