A tatooed madman, I'm hell on wheels  
Born a wicked child left alone in the fields  
My father was the wind, my mother was fire  
Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild  
A kamakazi man, a hollering 'Banzai'  
Never crash and burn, never gonna die  
ya cannibal it's me, ya scream and shout  
I'll chew ya up and spit ya out  
  
Storms i gotcha comin and its gonna be me.  
Here comes Trouble with a capital "T", ta,ta,ta  
  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
I gotta scream, that's what I am  
All the way, all the way  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned  
All they way, all the way, all the way  
  
Chewbacca in the rye, the water of fire  
A terror in the flesh, a killer for hire  
California man I'm white line, "Homer"  
The unruly one they call the "Blond Bomber"  
Scooter gypsy, I'm a renegade  
An orphan on the road, a live hand greande  
Never gonna quit before my time  
When the moon gets high then I'll be blind  
Mad dog 20-20's king,ooh  
I drink that stuff and start getting obscene  
  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
I gotta scream, that's what I am  
All the way, all the way  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned  
  
I'm a motorcycle man  
Don't ever give a damn  
I lie when the truth serves better  
The Marquis de Sade, I cheat,steal and rob  
A heavy metal creature  
All the way, all the way, all the way  
  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
I gotta scream, that's what I am  
All the way, all the way  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned  
All they way, all the way, all the way
