You say you want to kill yourself  
It might make it just a little bit easier  
You think you're the only one who hurts  
Try looking just a little bit harder  
I don't know why you're holding on  
To the damage that's been done  
'Cause you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to change your conclusion  
But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life  
Don't disguise your emptiness  
By placing blame on me and everyone else  
Protected by your safety nets  
But you can't put the heart of your fears at rest  
All I feel is deep regret for what you have become  
You've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to clear the confusion  
But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting  
I keep on trying 'cause you're busy wasting life  
You're busy wasting life  
You're busy wasting life  
I cannot go on this way  
I bring no consolation for you and your pain  
No one else can change your fate  
You'll have to do it for yourself  
You've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on trying to clear the confusion  
But you've got me wrapped up in your illusion  
I keep on dying 'cause you're busy wasting life  
You're busy wasting life,  
You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up  
You're busy wasting life, 'cause I keep on trying  
You're busy wasting life, you've got me wrapped up  
You're busy wasting life, and I keep on dying
