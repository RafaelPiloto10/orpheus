I took a ride with the Green Ranger  
He stepped up and showed me lots of things  
It liquefied my eye  
And sliced me up like pie  
All night my right ear always rings  
  
I took a ride with the Green Ranger  
Things were not quite as I had thought  
The Novato City fire  
Turned my nostril hairs to wire  
That's the night I nearly lost the plot  
  
Oh you nearly lost the plot  
Now didn't ya laddy  
? put on the bucket  
?  
  
Electrifies the night  
It aquifies the sight  
Watch out before you might just lose the plot  
  
Who wants to ride with the Green Ranger  
Who wants to ride with the Green Ranger  
Who wants to ride with the Green Ranger  
Who wants to ride with the Green Ranger
