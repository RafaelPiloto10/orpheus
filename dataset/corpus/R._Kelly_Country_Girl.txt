She was a country girl from Clebourne, Texas  
In a big city and she like my necklace  
So we started talking while we took a ride  
In a big pick-up truck and my hat was to the side.  
She was a country girl from the class of '96  
A big booty with some big ol' country tits  
A country name with some country attitude  
Say "yes ma'am" but at times she's kinda rude.  
A daddy's girl so I had to watch my ass.  
6 three Mr. Hill would whoop my ass.  
We can't kick it I'm a city kid  
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did  
(What we did)  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
She likes country livin' and acoustic guitars  
And Kenny Chesney and country bars  
And Cadillac's and I couldn't relate  
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date  
And her dad hated me... oh I knew it.  
He didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears, and black music.  
We still cow-tippin' and trippin'  
With that brush papa shirt lit back cause she was pimpin  
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin'  
Aint used to my style big limos and clubbin'  
A city kid and I'm doin' my thang  
I like an old country girl this is how I sing.  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
A country girl cut off jeans and lolly pops  
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops  
A country girl with them country ways  
Livin' big city nights  
But them country days  
A country girl don't understand thuggin  
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin  
A country girl pig-tails and care-free  
No direct dish just channel 3  
(Come on, this the only channel you have?)  
  
-[Chorus:]-  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a differenty world  
  
Country Girls taste like chicken....
