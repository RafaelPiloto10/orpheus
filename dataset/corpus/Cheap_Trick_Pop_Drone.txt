If I ever get back home again  
If I ever get back to you  
I won't care if the sun never shines  
You're all I want to do  
  
All that lays in front of us  
Won't get left behind  
'Cause I can see just fine around you-  
Sorry I'm not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanna do-  
I can see just fine around you  
You're all I ever wanted to do-  
Maybe I'm just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanted to-  
Sorry I"m just blind around you  
All I want is you  
  
If I ever get back home tonight  
If I ever get lost in you  
I won't care if the moon never shines  
You're all I wanna do  
  
All that lays in front of us  
Won't get left behind  
'Cause I can see just fine around you-  
Sorry I'm not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanna do-  
I can see just fine around you  
You're all I ever wanted to do-  
Maybe I'm just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanted to-  
Sorry I'm just blind around you  
All I want is you  
  
Sorry I'm not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
I can see just fine around you  
Maybe I'm just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Sorry I'm just blind around you
