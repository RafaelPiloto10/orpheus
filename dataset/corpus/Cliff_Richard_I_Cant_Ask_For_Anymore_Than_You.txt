You could have been a bad girl  
And wasted all my time  
You could have got me mad girl  
And made me lose my mind  
But you did what you have to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I can't ask for anymore than you  
  
It makes me very proud baby  
To know that you're my girl  
I want to say it loud baby  
I want to tell the world  
That you did what you had to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I can't ask for anymore than you  
I've got everything a man could need  
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed  
I won't cry myself to sleep no more  
'Cause I've found the love that I've been looking for  
  
Now I don't have a problem  
'Cause I know who I am  
You see I lost my only problem  
When you made me your man  
'Cause you did what you had to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I can't ask for anymore than you
