A wave toward the clearing the sky  
  
All this time we're talking and sharing our Rational View  
A billion other voices are spreading other news  
All this time we're living and trying to understand  
Why a billion other choices are making their demands  
  
Talk of a Peaceable Kingdom  
Talk of a time without fear  
The ones we wish would listen  
Are never going to hear  
  
Justice against The Hanged Man  
Knight of Wands against the hour  
Swords against the kingdom  
Time against The Tower  
  
All this time we're shuffling and laying out all our cards  
While a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards  
All this time we're hoping and praying we all might learn  
While a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn  
  
Dream of a Peaceable Kingdom  
Dream of a time without war  
The ones we wish would hear us  
Have heard it all before  
  
A wave toward the clearing sky  
A wave toward the clearing sky  
  
The Hermit against The Lovers  
Or the Devil against the Fool  
Swords against the kingdom  
The Wheel against the rules  
  
All this time we're burning like bonfires in the dark  
A billion other blazes are shooting off their sparks  
Every spark a drifting ember of desire  
To fall upon the earth and spark another fire  
  
A homeward angel on the fly  
A wave toward the clearing sky
