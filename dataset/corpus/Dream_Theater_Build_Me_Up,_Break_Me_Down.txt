Today, I will be a savior,  
Tomorrow a demon.  
You crave my erratic behavior  
And watch my every move.  
  
Obsession at all costs,  
You'll be the death of me.  
Broken and torn apart,  
Why can't you let me be?  
  
You build me up, you break me down  
Until I'm falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
I'm your guilty addiction.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
  
Today, a savior,  
Tonight, I am the new messiah you deify.  
When I'm no longer desired,  
I'll be crucified.  
  
The one who's free from sin,  
The first to cast the stone.  
Fighting the fear within,  
I won't be left alone.  
  
You build me up, you break me down  
Until I'm falling to pieces.  
The price I pay to live this way,  
And the fantasy stays alive.  
I can't live up, I can't let down  
And leave you falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
I'm your morning obsession.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
  
(I will be your savior)  
  
You build me up, you break me down  
Until I'm falling to pieces.  
The price I pay to live this way,  
And the fantasy stays alive.  
I can't live up, I can't let down  
And leave you falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
Your iconic fixation.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
Build me up!  
Break me down!
