Everybody look around  
'cause there's a reason to rejoice you see  
Everybody come out  
And let's commence to singing joyfully  
Everybody look up  
And feel the hope that we've been waiting for  
  
Everybody's glad  
Because our silent fear and dread is gone  
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully  
Just look about  
You owe it to yourself to check it out  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
  
Everybody be glad  
Because the sun is shining just for us  
Everybody wake up  
Into the morning into happiness  
  
Hello world  
It's like a different way of living now  
And thank you world  
We always knew that we'd be free somehow  
In harmony  
And show the world that we've got liberty  
  
It's such a change  
For us to live so independently  
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully  
Just look about  
You owe it to yourself to check it out  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
  
Everybody be glad  
Because the sun is shining just for us  
Everybody wake up  
Into the morning into happiness  
Hello world  
It's like a different way of living now  
And thank you world  
We always knew that we'd be free somehow  
In harmony  
And show the world that we've got liberty  
  
It's such a change  
For us to live so independently  
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully  
Just look about  
You owe it to yourself to check it out  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?  
Can't you feel a brand new day?
