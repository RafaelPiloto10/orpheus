I'll find my way beyond the fiery desert  
I'll swim across the vastness of the sea  
I'll climb to reach the dangers of the mountains  
I'll follow you to where you wanna be  
  
No creature's hand will lay upon your shoulder  
No ghost will bring you terrors from the past  
No witch's curse will keep me from believing  
In the truth that our love is meant to last  
  
I will face the trials that come my way  
And fight the forces evil kings have made  
It's enchantment that I need to live forever  
In a kingdom full of love that never fades  
It's the magic of our love that never fades  
  
I'll find my way beyond the fiery desert  
I'll swim across the vastness of the sea  
I'll climb to reach the dangers of the mountains  
I'll follow you to where you wanna be  
  
No creature's hand will lay upon your shoulder  
No ghost will bring you terrors from the past  
No witch's curse will keep me from believing  
In the truth that our love is meant to last  
  
I will face the trials that come my way  
And fight the forces evil kings have made  
It's enchantment that I need to live forever  
In a kingdom full of love that never fades  
It's the magic of a love that never fades  
  
My cries will echo through the shadows  
Speaking of my love till the whole world know  
  
I will face the trials that come my way  
And fight the forces evil kings have made  
It's enchantment that I need to live forever  
In a kingdom full of love that never fades  
It's the magic of a love that never fades  
  
The magic of our love will never fade
