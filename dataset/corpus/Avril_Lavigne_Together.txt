Something just isn't right  
I can feel it inside  
The truth isn't far behind me  
You can't deny  
  
When I turn the lights out  
When I close my eyes  
Reality overcomes me  
I'm living a lie  
  
When I'm alone I  
Feel so much better  
And when I'm around you  
I don't feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
This has gone on so long  
I realize that i need  
Something good to rely on  
Something for me  
  
When I'm alone I  
Feel so much better  
And when I'm around you  
I don't feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
My heart is broken  
I'm lying here  
My thoughts are choking on you my dear  
On you my dear  
On you my dear  
  
When I'm alone I  
Feel so much better  
And when I'm around you  
I don't feel  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
Together  
It doesn't feel right at all  
Together  
  
Together we built a wall  
Together  
Holding hands will fall  
Hands will fall  
  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you  
I don't feel together  
I don't feel together  
  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you  
I don't feel together  
I don't feel together
