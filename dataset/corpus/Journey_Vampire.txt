Baby get ready - I'm coming for you,  
I'm a vampire!  
I want you - nothing you can do,  
I'm a vampire!  
Watch me do my dance for you,  
I want you - nothing you can do,  
Baby get ready - I'm coming for you,  
I'm a vampire!  
  
Come to my world, child of the night,  
Come out of your darkness and into my light,  
Looking for you all of your life,  
Don't be afraid - it'll be all right...  
  
God grant you serenity,  
You bring out the best in me,  
Let my love take you higher,  
Guess what... I'm a vampire!

In your head you always hear me  
Close your eyes - I'm all that you see,  
For lust, for life, my intimate fire,  
Nightly dances, dance in desire...  
  
God grant you serenity,  
You bring out the best in me,  
Let my love take you higher,  
Guess what... I'm a vampire!

Baby get ready - I'm coming for you,  
I'm a vampire!  
  
(let's be together... Don't be afraid... You called me... I was what you
wished for...  
You held me here beside you... I was what you wished for... I came for you...
I came  
For you... I was what you wished for... You taste like honeydew... Be careful
what you  
Wish for... I wished for you your whole life... Be careful what you wish
for... Let me  
Be you tonight... Tonight...)  
  
Baby get ready - I'm coming for you,

I'm a vampire!  
Watch me do my dance for you,  
I want you - nothing you can do,  
Baby get ready - I'm coming for you,  
I'm a vampire!
