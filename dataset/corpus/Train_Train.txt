Now don't look down  
'Cause you might just see what's in the middle  
Rumor has it you've been lookin for me  
But there ain't much left of me to see, yeah  
  
Now don't go down  
Don't put your face in the place of the middle  
Your lamp is about to shine  
For a fee you'll be happy to be mine  
  
Look at yourself child  
You're the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back  
'Til you wait on the track for a train in the rain and it's comin' fast  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh train  
You go so fast  
It's a race for the place in the runnin'  
Well it won't take long 'til it brings you down  
You're in line just to waste your time  
Just to waste your time, just to waste your time  
In the big town  
  
Look at yourself child  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh train  
  
Well it's about a quarter to four  
And I'm not ready to hit the floor  
Sixteen and I've been on down and my cold neck  
And the back of your leg starts to drag down my  
Starts to drag down my street  
Here it comes again, ooh yeah  
  
Look at yourself girl  
Look at myself boy  
Look at yourself girl  
Look at yourself girl  
Look at yourself world  
  
Look at yourself child  
You're the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back  
'Til you wait on the track for a train in the rain and it's comin' fast  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh train  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh train  
You're the wife of a life on the street that will beat on your back  
'Til you wait on the track for a train in the rain and it's comin' fast
