Bluejean baby  
  
With your big blue eyes  
Don't want you looking  
At other guys  
Got to make you give me  
One more chance  
I can't keep still  
So baby let's dance  
  
Well the bluejean bop  
Is the bop for me  
It's the bop that's done  
In the dungaree  
You dip your hip  
You free your knee  
Well wiggle on your baby 1 2 3  
  
Well a bluejean bop  
Bluejean bop a baby  
Bluejean bop Bluejean bop a baby  
Bluejean bop  
Baby won't you bop with me
