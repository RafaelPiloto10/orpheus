I don't wanna get personal  
Why have you put me on the spot?  
I don't know how you feel  
But for me it's getting hard  
Swimming in the deep blue sea  
Marching in the big parade  
  
All I need is a little shade  
Standing in the light of love  
Standing in the light of love  
  
Doesn't matter who you are  
Or who you're not  
All it takes is a little love  
To make a handout worth a lot  
Swimming in the deep blue sea  
Marching in the big parade  
  
All I need is a little shade  
Standing in the light of your love  
Standing in the light of love  
  
Drowning in the deep blue sea  
Drudging in the long parade  
  
All I need is a little shade  
Standing in the light of your love  
Standing in the light of love  
  
Standing in the light of love  
Standing in the light of love
