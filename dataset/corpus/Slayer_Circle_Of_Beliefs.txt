Can't explain the other side  
Answers lost before their eyes  
Violence surges from inside  
A state of mind that never dies  
Born into a chosen way  
Life that doesn't fit today  
To die a painful death it seems  
Is better than your misery  
Contemplating rearranging  
Changing all your ways of thinking  
  
Everyday your life seems like  
It's pushed into a hole  
Acting out another's needs  
To rule a soul eternally  
Adjusting to another set  
Of values takes its toll  
Growing in a lunacy  
That plays on your stupidity  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Born without a brain  
Helpless in your name  
All you do is pray  
Living is your pain  
  
Mentality so small you can't  
Accept another side  
Your point of view a memory  
Because it doesn't mean a thing  
The resurrections waiting for  
A world without a sin  
The temples all will crumble  
While awaiting for it to begin  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Losing is your way  
Mental destiny  
I can see your strain  
You don't want to be saved  
  
Can't you see no validity  
Must control silencing of souls  
Show decay spreading through your brain  
Devastate the deviant will dominate  
  
Can't you see there's no validity  
Your way is not the only way  
Slow decay is spreading through your brain  
Don't you see the power of the enemy  
Tyranny total supremacy  
Control the silencing of souls  
Slavery within the entity  
Devastate, dominate  
  
Can't explain the reason why  
Someone would rather live than die  
If dying is the only way  
Top end a life of mental sins  
All your life he's been the cause  
A man impaled onto a cross  
Pure religious holocaust  
If religion dies it's not my boss  
  
Perception always biased  
Feeding off a fallacy  
Your systematic way of life  
Decided for you every night  
Intentional conflicting words  
Avoid solidity  
Blinded by the holy light  
That constantly consumes your mind  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Burning in my wake  
Souls are free to take  
Your following a fake  
Everyone awake
