Don't worry 'bout me  
It's all over now  
Though I may be blue  
I'll manage somehow  
Love can't be explained  
It can't be controlled  
Once day it's warm  
Next day it's cold  
  
Don't pitty me 'cause I feelin' blue  
Don't be ashamed  
It might happen to you  
Oh, oh love, kiss me one time  
Then go love, I'll understand  
Don't worry 'bout me  
  
Sweet sweet sweet love  
I want you to be  
As happy as I  
When you love me  
Well, I'll never forget you  
Your sweet memory  
It's all over now  
Well don't worry 'bout me  
  
Then when I tell some heart, one heart good-bye  
One heart is free  
And one heart will cry  
Oh, oh sweet sweet baby sweet baby sweet  
It's alright  
Well, don't worry 'bout me
