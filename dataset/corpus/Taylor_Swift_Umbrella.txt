You had my heart, we'll never be worlds apart  
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star  
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars  
That's when you need me there, with you I'll always share  
  
Because when the sun shines we'll shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said I'll always be your friend  
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end  
  
Now that it's raining more than ever  
Know that we'll still have each other  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay  
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay  
  
Just trying to get your attention
