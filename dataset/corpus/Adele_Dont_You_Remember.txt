When will I see you again?  
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said  
No final kiss to seal anything  
I had no idea of the state we were in  
  
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
When was the last time you thought of me?  
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?  
I often think about where I went wrong  
The more I do, the less I know  
  
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe  
I kept my distance so you would be free,  
In hope that you find the missing piece  
To bring you back to me  
  
Why don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before  
Baby please remember me once more  
When will I see you again?
