By my grandfather's bed, my mother is reading  
Psalm 62, God is our refuge  
And my grandfather stirs, could it be  
He is waking one final time  
He has something to say  
If you only knew what lies awaiting  
If you could only see what I can see  
If you could only hear the music playing  
The angels singing sweet victory  
Oh, if you only knew, if you only knew  
How much He loves you  
By my grandfather's bed, my mother is broken  
Psalm 17, O God, I call on You  
She doesn't want to hear any words about leaving  
My grandfather says, "Fear not, this is my time  
And into His presence I'll fly"  
If you only knew what lies awaiting  
If you could only see what I can see  
If you could only hear the music playing  
The angels singing sweet victory  
Oh, if you only knew, if you only knew  
How much He loves you  
If you only knew, if you only knew  
How much He loves you
