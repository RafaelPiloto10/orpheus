Marching across our own screens  
Our faces form all our needs  
The future's not returning  
All bridges built for burning  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
One day I'll just erase the tape, wave goodbye, and fade away  
Get lost in the frost again  
Clean the ashes of my face at the bottom of your suitcase  
Find a sunset, turn away  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
We walk around inside each other visiting the empty rooms  
Put me on, I'll put you on too  
You knew I'd have to follow you because you saw I'm hollow too  
But it's so nice being I too  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Chorus:  
We're nowhere  
We don't care who led us here  
No-one will care when we're gone  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Too many pictures on my screen and all of them are screaming at me  
Thought I had this insulation  
The only way to stop the flood whenever feelings get too real  
Is to cut the information  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
(Chorus)  
The frozen ones  
(Repeat and fade)
