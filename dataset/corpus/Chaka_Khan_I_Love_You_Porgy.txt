I want to stay here  
But I ain't worthy  
You are to descent to understand  
For when I see him  
He hypnotizes me  
When he takes hold of me  
With his hard hand  
  
Someday, I know he's comin' back  
To call me  
He's gonna handle me and hold me so  
It's gonna be like dyin', Porgy  
Deep inside me,  
But when he calls I have to go  
  
I love you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If I can stay here, and you would keep me  
  
I love you Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
If you can keep me, I wants to stay here  
  
With you forever and I'd be glad  
I love you Porgy
