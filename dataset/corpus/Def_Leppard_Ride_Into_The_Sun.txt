Revvin' up, hundred 'n' four  
Hammer down, foot to the floor  
Such a hard ride  
Ride into the sun  
Shootin' in  
Got a ticket to ride  
Movin' out  
This is no place to hide  
When you're ridin'  
Ride into the sun  
  
We gonna make it baby  
So step inside  
And if we make it baby  
We're gonna ride into the sun  
Just ride into the sun  
  
Burn it up  
We're gonna cruise  
Kick down  
Nothin' to lose  
When you're ridin'  
Ride into the sun  
  
A hot shot  
Hooked on the street  
I'm in love  
Got the fire in me  
When I'm ridin'  
Ride into the sun  
  
We gonna make it baby  
So step inside  
And if we make it baby  
We're gonna ride  
Ride on!  
  
We gonna make it baby  
So step inside  
And if we make it baby  
Ya know we're gonna  
Ride  
Ride into the sun  
Yeah  
Ride into the sun  
Just ride into the sun  
Yeah  
Hey!
