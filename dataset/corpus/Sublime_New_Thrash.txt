I got so much trouble on my mind  
That it feels just like I'm always sleeping with the enemy  
But I know the real world always gets the last word  
And that's why you gotta kick reality.  
So don't tease me and try to say I should care.  
I might as well go out for mine  
Cause everybody's going out for theirs.  
  
So don't tell me about a fake drug war  
Go cut education programs more  
The people will one day learn and rise  
Cause not everyone is out to score.  
  
People always ask me why people are all fucked up  
At every corner liquor store.
