Artist: James Taylor Lyrics  
Song: Bittersweet Lyrics  
No I don't know how to love you  
The way you want me to  
Coz everytime I try  
Something always changes with you  
First it's cold baby  
And then there's too much heat  
One minute I'm up in heaven  
And the next I'm down in the street  
Coz we got a love  
That's bittersweet  
I said we got a love  
It's bittersweet  
Sometimes when I'm with you  
It's like you're just not there  
When I look into your eyes  
I see that thousand yard stare  
Then you're back in love with me  
Like you can't get enough  
Rough into smooth  
And the smooth back into the rough  
Ohhhh help me now  
We got a love  
That's bittersweet  
We got a love, oh darlin'  
That's bittersweet  
I don't know anybody  
Anybody like you  
I never met anybody  
Could make me feel the way you do  
I wish that I could love you  
The way you want me to  
So scared you'll pull out the rug  
Darling if I do  
It's cold it's cold  
And now there's too much heat  
One mnute I'm up in heaven  
And the next, I'm walking the street  
We got a love  
That's bittersweet  
You know we got a love  
That's bittersweet  
We got a love  
That's bittersweet  
You know, we got a love, oh darlin'  
That's bittersweet.  
Flamin' hot  
Then not.  
Ooooooooh, bitter memory  
I said we got a love, oooh,  
We got a love.
