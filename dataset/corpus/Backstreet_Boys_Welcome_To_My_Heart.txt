Darkness falls  
I thought I heard you call  
Or was it just a dream?  
I'm a little scared knowing you're out there  
So far away from me  
  
Its been so long  
Since you've been gone  
Every day I miss you more  
Now I wanna know  
Why did you have to go?  
What were you looking for?  
  
And I hope you find your way,  
But I can't wait to say  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
So you lost your way but that's yesterday  
And I don't care where you've been  
Cause every step you've taking since you left  
Has brought you back again  
And I hope you see it clear  
My love has always been right here  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
I'm glad you found your way  
And I hope you are here to stay  
Oooooooh  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart ...
