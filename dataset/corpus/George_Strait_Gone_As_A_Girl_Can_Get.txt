Well I haven't seen her lately, and she never calls.  
She don't ask my friends about me, gives no clues at all.  
Yeah the fire might still be burnin' yeah,  
But I'd say she's about as gone as a girl can get.  
  
She don't even show up in my dreams at night,  
But my stubborn ol' memory keeps holdin' on tight.  
Sure makes it hard to forget  
She's about as gone as a girl can get.  
  
She's outta here, she disappeared without a trace.  
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face.  
Her destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight,  
Last seen headin' right on out of my life.  
Like a stranger I ain't never met,  
She's about as gone as a girl can get,
