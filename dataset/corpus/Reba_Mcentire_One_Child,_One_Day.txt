Three wise men, a shining star  
A mother and a father who had come so far  
How could they know about their son  
And the miracle he'd become  
That he held the soul of man  
In his tiny little hands  
  
[Chorus]  
One child one day  
And the universe will never be the same  
From Bethlehem  
Cause the angels' voices rejoicing in his name  
Oh, and I believe with all my heart  
That he will show the way  
And you and I will meet  
One child one day  
  
A small white church, a mountainside  
Cathedrals filled with music, and golden light  
Oh, we gather everywhere  
For the peace that's always there  
For the story that is told  
Of a birth so long ago  
  
[Chorus]
