Faithful, true as the stars above  
And while I live, I shall give all my love,  
So faithful, praying that evermore,  
You'll love but me as the sea loves the shore.  
In everything I'll do my part,  
Love's golden ring is round my heart.  
Faithful, that's what I'll be to you,  
Oh promise me you will be faithful too.  
(Faithful, true as the stars above)  
(And while I live, I shall give all my love,)  
In everything I'll do my part,  
Love's golden ring is round my heart.  
Faithful, that's what I'll be to you,  
Oh promise me you will be faithful too.  
(chorus coda)
