Uggh!  
Pull, pull  
Wuh! (Sung sorta like Michael Jackson)  
Come on!  
Uggh!  
Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list  
Al live, never on a floppy disk  
Inka, inka, bottle of ink  
Paintings of rebellion  
Drawn up by the thoughts I think  
  
Yeah!  
Come on!  
The militant poet in once again, check it  
  
It's set up like a deck of cards  
They're sending us to early graves  
For all the diamonds  
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades  
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit  
More like the murals that fit  
Don't turn away  
Get in front of it  
  
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?  
Did ya lose it on the wall  
Playin' tic-tac-toe?  
  
Yo, check the diagonal  
Three brothers gone  
Come on  
Doesn't that make it three in a row?  
  
Spoken quietly: 'Anger is a gift'  
Come on!  
Uggh!  
  
Check that!  
Uggh!  
Come on  
Yeah  
Uggh  
  
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?  
Did ya lose it on the wall  
Playin' tic-tac-toe?  
  
Yo, check the diagonal  
Three million gone  
Come on  
'Cause they're counting backwards to zero  
  
Environment  
The environment exceeding on the level  
Of our unconsciousness  
For example  
What does the billboard say  
Come and play, come and play  
Forget about the movement  
  
Spoken quietly: 'Anger is a gift'  
Yeah!  
Uggh!  
Awww, bring that shit in!  
Uggh!  
Hey!  
  
Freedom yea  
Freedom yea right  
Freedom yeah!  
Freedom!  
Yea!  
Freedom!  
Yea right!  
Freedom!  
Yea!  
Freedom!  
Yea!  
Right!
