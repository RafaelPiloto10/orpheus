She was abused he thought it brung amused but it Really brought pain  
The shame being known as the girl with no name it Droved her insane  
The lie's, rumors, and the blame she couldn't no Longer take the rain  
  
She was only 15 she didn't now where her dreams Led she wanted to be a singer  
But didn't know about the pain it might bring her Fed up, fed up ohhh she was
fed up  
  
She thought she was in love with the boy that Brung her down left her everyday  
With a frown black eyes on her way too school but She always kept it cool  
But the tears layed inside questions why pop in Her head late at night while  
Sshe sit on her bed wishing she was dead.  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
Finally got loose left the nam she was abused by 19 and no more crys  
Now she's living her dream seeing the things that She thought she'll never  
See I guess she was fed up by being dumped Punched now it's all over  
Now she's stronger Iam sorry but her name  
Couldn't be mentioned but all  
You need too know was that we were real close  
  
Chorus repeat till end
