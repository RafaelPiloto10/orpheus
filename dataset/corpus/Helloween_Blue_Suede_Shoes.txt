Well, it's one for the money  
Two for the show, three to get ready  
Now go cat, go but don't you  
Step on my blue suede shoes  
For you can knock me down, step in my face  
Slander my name all over the place  
Do anything that you wanna do  
But, oh oh, honey, lay off of my shoes  
Well, you can do anything  
But lay off of my blue suede shoes  
You can burn my house, you can steal my car  
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar  
You can do anything that you wanna do  
But, oh oh, honey, lay off of my blue suede shoes  
You can do anything  
But don't step on my blue suede shoes  
Well, it's one for the money  
Two for the show, three to get ready  
Now go cat, go but don't you  
Step on my blue suede shoes  
Blue, blue, blue, blue suede shoes
