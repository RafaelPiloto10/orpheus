Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring  
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss  
She blames him and he blames her  
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is  
And all of the time in the back of their minds  
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been  
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring  
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again  
Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts  
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for  
A stranger here, a stranger there  
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more  
And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight  
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn  
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring  
Two unhappy people to the point of no return  
And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids  
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy they choose  
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins  
And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose
