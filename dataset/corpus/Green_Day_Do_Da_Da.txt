Every time I'm falling down  
You take the repercussions  
Headaches and anxieties  
Advancing my frustrations  
  
Rush into my depression  
Sacrifice everything  
Waste with me into nothing  
Well now you're stuck with me  
  
Hand up your soul to my wrist  
And I'll vow my trust to you  
Moving on and I always thought  
I realized you've imagined  
You take the repercussions  
Headaches and anxieties  
Advancing my frustrations  
  
Rush into my depression  
Sacrifice everything  
Waste with me into nothing  
Well now you're stuck with me  
  
Hand up your soul to my wrist  
And I'll vow my trust to you  
Moving on and I always thought  
I realized you've imagined
