When the evening sun goes down you will find me hanging round  
Oh the night life ain't no good life but it's my life  
Many people just like me dreaming of old used-to-be  
  
Yeah the night life it ain't no good life but it's my life  
Yeah listen to the blues they're playin' yeah listen to what those blues are
sayin'  
Mine is just another scene from the world of broken dreams  
Yeah the night life it ain't no good life but it's my life
