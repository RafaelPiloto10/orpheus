The lies that you tell will leave you alone  
They'll keep you down,  
they'll catch you and trip you up  
Keep you hangin' around  
  
The habit is old, you don't need it anymore  
Go on and kiss it goodbye  
'Cause you got me, and I can see  
Who you really are  
I want to show you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart  
  
I'm right here beside you  
there's nobody else to set you straight  
To shake you, to let you know  
That it's still not too late  
I want to show you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart  
  
Don't make up stories,  
I know you by your eyes  
I think I know what's inside  
  
The streets you've been on  
Will leave you out in the cold  
But you know I care,  
And years from now  
We'll both look down from the top of the stairs  
Here I've shown you my heart  
I want to know you by heart  
And love you by heart
