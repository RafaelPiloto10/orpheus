Whoa, oh yeah  
I've seen pictures  
  
Well, I saw you just the other day  
And I could not help but look your way  
I say you've just got this special look  
That has got me completely hooked  
  
[Chorus]  
Pictures on the wall  
Pictures everywhere  
Pictures on the wall  
Everywhere I stare  
Pictures on the wall  
The ceiling and the floor  
I'm in a metal room  
And I cannot find the door  
  
Will this feeling ever go away?  
Or will this feeling stay?  
Will this feeling ever go away?  
'Cause I can't live the rest of my life this way  
  
Pictures on the wall  
(Come on)  
Pictures everywhere  
Pictures on the wall  
(Come on, come on)  
Everywhere I stare  
Pictures on the wall  
(Come on, come on)  
The ceiling and the floor  
I'm in a metal room and I cannot find the door  
  
I see your face in the clouds in the sky  
I see your face before my eyes, yeah  
I see your face everywhere  
And now I don't know what to do  
Oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, pictures
