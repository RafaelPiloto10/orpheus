Untem, gliben, glaussen, glauben  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy  
  
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis  
  
You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today  
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway  
He may not have a clue and he may not have style  
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial  
  
So don't debate, a player straight  
You know he really doesn't get it anyway  
Gonna play the field, and keep it real  
For you, no way, for you, no way  
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate  
At least, you'll know you can always go on ricki lake  
The world needs wannabes  
So hey hey, do that brand new thing  
  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy  
  
He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice  
But they didn't have ice cube, so he bought vanilla ice  
Now cruising in his pinto, he sees homies as he pass  
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass  
  
So don't debate, a player straight  
You know he really doesn't get it anyway  
Gonna play the field, and keep it real  
For you, no way, for you, no way  
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate  
At least, you'll know you can always go on ricki lake  
The world loves wannabes  
So hey hey, do that brand new thing  
  
Now, he's getting a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done  
He asked for a 13, but they drew a 31  
Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip  
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip  
  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Give it to me, baby, huh huh, huh huh  
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis  
  
So don't debate, a player straight  
You know he really doesn't get it anyway  
Gonna play the field, and keep it real  
For you, no way, for you, no way  
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate  
At least, you'll know you can always go on ricki lake  
  
The world needs wannabes  
The world loves wannabes  
Let's get some more wannabes  
And hey hey, do that brand new thing
