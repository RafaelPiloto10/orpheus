It's the time of the season  
When the love runs high  
In this time, give it to me easy  
And let me try  
With pleasured hands  
  
To take you and the sun to  
Promised lands  
To show you every one  
It's the time of the season for loving  
  
What's your name?  
(What's your name?)  
Who's your daddy?  
(Who's your daddy? He rich?)  
Is he rich like me?  
  
Has he taken  
(Has he taken)  
Any time  
(Any time to show)  
To show you what you need to live?  
Tell it to me slowly  
Tell you what?  
I really want to know  
It's the time of the season for loving  
  
What's your name?  
(What's your name?)  
Who's your daddy?  
(Who's your daddy? He rich?)  
Is he rich like me?  
  
Has he taken  
(Has he taken)  
Any time  
(Any time to show)  
To show you what you need to live?  
Tell it to me slowly  
Tell you what?  
I really want to know  
It's the time of the season for loving
