A woman is the sweetest thing  
On that we all agree  
But when she gets the wedding band  
A mans no longer free  
  
That's why I'm safe, sane and single  
I'm on my merry way  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That's how I'm gonna stay  
  
A wife and husband came upon  
The parting of their ways  
The judge gave her the bank account  
And gave him 90 days  
  
That's why I'm safe, sane and single  
I'm on my merry way  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That's how I'm gonna stay  
  
A friend of mine got married  
To a gal named Nellie Gray  
She pawned his watch then sold his car  
And gave his clothes away  
  
That's why I'm safe, sane and single  
I'm on my merry way  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That's how I'm gonna stay  
  
I met a gal in Birmingham  
And thereby hangs a tale  
She had a husband doing time  
Another out on bail  
  
That's why I'm safe, sane and single  
I'm on my merry way  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That's how I'm gonna stay  
  
Ha, ha ,ha, I got one  
  
I courted a gal for 15 years  
Her Pa said we should wed  
If my horse could only cook  
I'd marry him instead  
  
That's why I'm safe, sane and single  
I'm on my merry way  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That's how I'm gonna stay  
  
Thank God I'm safe, Thank God I'm safe,  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That how I'm gonna stay  
Thank God I'm safe, Thank God I'm safe,  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That how I'm gonna stay!  
Thank God I'm safe, Thank God I'm safe,  
Yes I'm safe, sane and single  
That how I'm gonna stay!  
  
Now you got that?
