You'll never know what it feels like 'til you're there.  
When love changes, faces appears from nowhere.  
When beautiful lovely is ugly or alone.  
You need me back bad just can't be on your own.  
  
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb.  
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb.  
  
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit.  
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry.  
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye.  
  
Now your life is broken, revolves around love.  
Not love of yourself but the love you have lost.  
We said desperation is lonely despair.  
You don't love yourself, you've got no love to share.  
  
Love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb.  
Yeah love is not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb.  
  
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit.  
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry.  
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye.  
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit.  
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry.  
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye.  
  
If you're gonna, get me back, you're gonna have to ask, nicer than that.  
If you're gonna, get me back, you're gonna have to ask, nicer than that.  
Nicer than that!  
Nicer than that!  
Nicer than that!  
Nicer than that!  
  
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit.  
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry.  
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye.  
Never said goodbye (If you're gonna, get me back, you're gonna have to ask,
nicer than that)  
  
(If you're gonna, get me back, you're gonna have to ask, nicer than that)
