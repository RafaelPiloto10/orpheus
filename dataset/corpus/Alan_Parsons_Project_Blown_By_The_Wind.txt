(Bairnson)  
  
All along the shoreline  
There are footprints by the sea  
They head into the distance...  
Then they lead right back to me  
I made the break to freedom  
Now I'm following the dream  
You're never going to get here  
If you hold the old routine  
  
Now everything we possess  
That fills our empty lives  
Is only good for leaving far behind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we're going,  
Don't know why  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Call along the valley  
And you just may find us there  
I couldn't say for certain  
Cause we may be anywhere  
Head into the sunset  
Or just wander out to sea  
Wherever your heart leads you  
Is the place you're meant to be  
  
And someone who could be impressed  
With ordinary lies  
Could really use a little peace of mind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we'll go,  
But we'll get by  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Now everything we possess  
That fills our empty lives  
Is only good for leaving far behind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we're going,  
Don't know why  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again
