  
I want to scream, I want to shout  
I want to know what it's all about  
I've seen it before, but not like this  
I saw your name, it was on the list  
  
By 4 o'clock (It's gonna change)  
You were pretty high (It's gonna change)  
Lying on the floor (It's gonna change)  
Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)  
I remember you (It's gonna change)  
When you were a kid (It's gonna change)  
It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)  
The things you did  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
No cold heart could turn away  
And not be moved by what I saw today:  
There on the floor, thirty years or more  
He doesn't care, he just wants to score  
  
By 4 o'clock (It's gonna change)  
You were pretty high (It's gonna change)  
Lying on the floor (It's gonna change)  
Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)  
I remember you (It's gonna change)  
When you were a kid (It's gonna change)  
It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)  
The things you did  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
Yet it only seems just like yesterday  
We used to run and hide  
Remember in the park where we used to play  
The grass looked ten foot high  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand
