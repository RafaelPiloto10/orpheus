Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody  
That will love you half as much as me  
My heart is always with you  
No matter what you do  
So sail away sweet sister  
Cause I'll always be in love with you  
  
[From this point on is actually from "Bad Time" by Grand Funk Railroad]  
But let her be somebody else's queen  
I don't want to know about you  
'cause too many others know what I mean  
And that's why I got to live without you  
  
I'm in love with a girl  
I'm talkin' about  
I'm in love with a girl  
That I can't live without  
I'm in love but it feels like  
I'm livin' it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a Bad Time  
To be in love
