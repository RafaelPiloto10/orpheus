I don't pick up the mail,  
I don't pick up the phone,  
I don't answer the door,  
I just soon be alone  
I don't keep this place up,  
I just keep the lights down,  
I don't live in these rooms,  
I just rattled around  
  
I'm just a ghost in this house,  
I'm shadow upon these walls,  
As quietly as a mouse,  
I haunt these halls,  
I'm just a whisper of smoke,  
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house  
  
I don't care if it rains,  
I don't care if it's clear,  
I don't mind stayin' near,  
There's another ghost here,  
He sits down in your chair,  
And he shines with your light,  
And he lays down his head,  
On your pillow at night  
  
I'm just a ghost in this house,  
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,  
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,  
I'm just a whisper of smoke,  
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house  
  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house
