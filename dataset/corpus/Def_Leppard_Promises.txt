Last night I was blown away  
I said a million things I'd never say  
I was knocked right down, it got to me  
Gonna get me some of your chemistry  
  
You want me to promise you  
That everything is true  
  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
I won't make promises that I don't mean  
I'll even mean the things I tell you in my sleep, yeah  
I won't make promises babe, that I can't keep  
  
Oh my my, I lost control  
I told you everything, I said it all  
You came right out and said to me  
"Gonna get me some of your honesty"  
  
You want me to promise you  
That everything is true  
  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
I won't make promises that I don't mean  
I'll even mean the things I tell you in my sleep, yeah  
I won't make promises babe, that I can't keep  
  
You want me to promise you  
That everything is true  
  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
I won't make promises that I don't mean  
I'll even mean the things I whisper in my sleep  
Oh, let me tell you  
I won't say a single thing darling, that you can't believe  
You gotta believe me  
  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
Oh baby believe me now  
I won't make promises that I don't mean  
Oh why won't you believe me now  
I'll even mean the things I whisper in my sleep, yeah  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
Baby, you gotta believe me
