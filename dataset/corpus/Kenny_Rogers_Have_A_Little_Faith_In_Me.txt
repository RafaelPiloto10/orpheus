When the road gets dark and you can no longer see  
Just let my love throw a spark, baby  
And have a little faith in me  
And when the tears you cry are all you can believe  
Just give these loving arms a try, baby  
And have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
When your secret heart  
cannot speak so easily  
Come here darlin', and from a whisper start  
Have a little faith in me  
And when your back's against the wall  
Just turn around, and you will see  
I will catch you, I will catch your fall  
So have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
I've been loving you  
For such a long, long time, baby  
Expect nothing in return,  
Just for you to have a little faith in me  
You know time, time is our friend  
For you and me, yeah, there is no end  
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me  
  
Say, I'll hold you up, I'll hold you up  
Strength is enough, so have a little faith in me  
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me  
I said all you gotta do is have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me
