O holy night the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine  
The thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine
