An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day  
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw  
A ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat  
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet  
'Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their cry  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
If you want to save your soul from hell a ridin' on our range  
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky
