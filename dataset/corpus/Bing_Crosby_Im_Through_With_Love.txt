I have given you my true love,  
But you love a new love.  
What am I supposed to do now  
With you now, you're through?  
You'll be on your merry way  
And there's only this to say:  
I'm through with love  
I'll never fall again.  
Said adieu to love  
Don't ever call again.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.  
I've locked my heart  
I'll keep my feelings there.  
I have stocked my heart  
With icy, frigid air.  
And I mean to care for no one  
Because I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you  
To hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care?  
You didn't need me for you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you.  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be.  
For I must have you or no one  
And so I'm through with love.
