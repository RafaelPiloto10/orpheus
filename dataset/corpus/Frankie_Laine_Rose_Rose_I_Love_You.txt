Rose, Rose I love you with an aching heart  
What is your future?, now we have to part  
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away  
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay  
  
Make way, oh, make way for my Eastern Rose  
Men crowd in dozens everywhere she goes  
In her rickshaw on the street or in a cabaret  
"Please make way for Rose" you can hear them say  
  
All my life I shall remember  
Oriental music and you in my arms  
Perfumed flowers in your tresses  
Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms  
  
Rose, Rose I love you with your almond eyes  
Fragrant and slender 'neath tropical skies  
I must cross the seas again and never see you more  
Way back to my home on a distant shore  
  
(All my life I shall remember)  
(Oriental music and you in my arms)  
(Perfumed flowers in your tresses)  
(Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms)  
  
Rose, Rose I leave you, my ship is in the bay  
Kiss me farewell now, there's nothing to say  
East is East and West is West, our worlds are far apart  
I must leave you now but I leave my heart  
  
Rose, Rose I love you with an aching heart  
What is your future?, now we have to part  
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away  
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay  
  
(Rose, Rose I love you, I cannot stay)
