I need some wisdom  
I need some truth  
I need some beauty  
I need some proof  
  
And in the meantime  
I need a place to hide  
If I had you babe I'd be satisfied  
  
Went to the ocean  
Stood in the surf  
I felt the water  
I felt the earth  
I head the angels  
They couldn't be denied  
If I had you babe  
I'd be satisfied  
  
Who's gonna beleive me  
I'm a broken down dog  
But I can still snarl with the best  
The train is leavin  
We can catch it if we run  
We can leave it all behind  
This utter emptiness  
  
You are the reason  
That I was born  
You are the answer  
I'm lookin for  
All of the others  
Just stood around and lied  
If I had you babe  
I'd be satisfied  
  
Ooooh yeah  
Awwwh yeah  
Awwwh
