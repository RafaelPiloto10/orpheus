Once my life had no direction, I was lost as could be  
I was caught in a whirlpool, spinning around in misery  
I needed a friend, you took me in and you touched my heart  
With your song of love you gave me a brand new start  
Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringing inside my head  
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love  
You gave me just enough to make me hunger for more of you  
Now I'm hooked on your lovin' and I don't want to break loose  
With my heart in my hand, I'm yours to command, do what you want me to  
Just never let me go, Lord, I'm so in love with you  
Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love  
Beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  
Beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head
