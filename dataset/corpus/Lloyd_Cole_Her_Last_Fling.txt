There you go again  
Alma tell me when  
Will you never learn  
And now you're underweight  
And overpaid  
You will not be saved  
And you're pushing 38  
Heaven knows your train is late  
Although my chance is slim  
You percieve the state you're in  
Is good for one last fling  
In a drastic dress you walk in drastic steps  
Revealing no interest  
You know it seems you wont be spared  
And you're so much wiser unaware, unaware  
Independent means being alone and being  
Good for one last fling  
So there you go again  
Alma tell me when  
Will you ever learn  
Instead you walk in these drastic steps  
When you know too well  
You're train has left, you're train has left
