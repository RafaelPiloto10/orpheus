[Chorus:]  
Gypsy, gypsy, dancing feet  
Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet  
Screamer, dreamer, disarray  
Gypsy, gypsy, why don't you fly away?  
  
No good, papa's no good, sister's no good and that's a drag  
Sometimes you feel like your heads on the ceiling  
When you scream your mama rag  
When your daddy come home with an old soup bone  
And take all your money away  
And your mama's in the kitchen on the phone she be bitchin'  
And your girlfriend who called to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
High school lover with ya cops undercover and gettin' high, drank Lebanese  
Hey mama choose that you been through  
And it's right between your knees  
Hair case, shotgun, rock on, chewing gum, take it to the dance tonight...  
Your love child with wild child smile  
And don't care wrong from right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody but nobody baby knockin' my socks off  
Rock, rockin' baby I'll be gettin' my rocks off  
Nobody but nobody shootin' never get a shot off  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
