I feel like  
I've been watching  
The stars as  
They collide  
The past  
It haunts me  
Yeah  
It kills me  
Every single time  
And now  
My mind  
Is racing  
My heart  
Pounds in my chest  
  
I know  
I have to let you go  
But I just can't forget  
  
I'm so in love  
But I found your lies  
Tell me  
I'm having  
Just a  
Bad dream  
Tonight  
  
Come wake me up  
Tell me love  
That it's all alright  
Tell me  
I'm having  
Just a  
Bad dream  
Tonight  
  
(Bad dream tonight)  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
  
I wish  
I never knew  
What  
I somehow  
Figured out  
Lie and tell me  
You don't know  
What I'm talking about  
  
How do I recover  
From these pictures  
In my head?  
You were the love  
Of my life  
I sure hope  
She was worth it
