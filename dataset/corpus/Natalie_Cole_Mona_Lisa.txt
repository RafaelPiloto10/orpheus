Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you  
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile  
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you  
Or that Mona Lisa strangeness in your style  
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa  
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart  
Many dreams have been brought to your door step  
They just lie there and they die there  
Are you warm? Are you real Mona Lisa?  
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art  
  
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa  
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart  
Many dreams have been brought to your door step  
They just lie there and they die there  
Are you warm? Are you real Mona Lisa?  
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art  
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
