So I think I got it all in place now  
No distractions under control  
Yet there's something missing inside me  
I'm chasing shadows of myself  
And the clocks are ticking  
Oh my world is spinning  
Spinning 'round and 'round  
And 'round and 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
And I try  
I try to reason why  
Don't you know I can't go on this way  
Baby please don't walk away there is this place  
Where I toss away my pride  
So you can see that I'm the one  
To take you to a higher place this time  
  
I am on the outside looking in  
To a place where I will be  
Let me give you what you need from me  
I surrender my soul to you  
And my heart is pounding  
And a fire's burning  
And my head is spinning, 'round and 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I crash, and burn inside my mind  
It happens time and time again, I can't explain the way you make me feel  
Oh, I know, I don't have much to give  
But what I have I give to you with all the madness left inside of me  
With the madness left inside of me, oh  
  
[Chorus]
