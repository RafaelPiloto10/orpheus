(jack hues)  
Let's rent a place in town  
Somewhere we can call our own  
Let's knock these barriers down  
We need to spend some time alone  
Everything in the world has a name  
Oh doesn't it make you feel  
Like you've moved into a rented apartment  
Everything is real  
But it doesn't belong to you  
Chorus:  
All the words are dead, so we need to  
Snakedance  
All the words are dead, so we need to  
Snakedance  
Let's get that empty room  
But first I really must be sure  
Every word, every name you know  
Will vanish when we close the door  
Just say oh (all the words are dead)  
Just say yeah (so we need to snakedance)  
Just say ugh (all the words are dead)  
Just say ooo (so we need to snakedance)  
Wrap yourself around me  
Help me start again  
Wrap yourself around me  
And girl let's snakedance  
Snakedance  
Don't give me talking, give me snakedance  
All the words are dead, so we need to  
Snakedance  
Nothing more be said, so we need to  
Snakedance  
If logic is a glass bead game  
And science is an iron wheel  
And your life is a riderless horse  
Dragging you by the heel  
You need a place where you can concentrate  
On what it is to be  
Don't think, don't speak any language  
The silence in the room  
Is all that belongs to you  
Wrap yourself around me  
Help me start again  
Wrap yourself around me  
And girl let's snakedance  
Repeat chorus twice
