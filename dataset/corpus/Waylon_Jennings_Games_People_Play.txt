Oh the games people now every night and every day now  
Never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean oh no  
Well they wile away the hours in their ivory towers  
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine oh yeah  
  
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee  
  
Talkin' bout you and me and the games people play oh now  
Well we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye  
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame  
  
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten  
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been  
And it's a dirty rotten shame yes it does  
  
People walkin' up to ya shouting glory hallelujah  
Well they want to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord  
Gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate  
Furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board  
  
Lotten da la da da da...  
  
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me  
God give me the serenity to remember who I am  
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity  
Turn your back on humanity cause you don't give a do de dee  
  
Lotten da la da da da...
