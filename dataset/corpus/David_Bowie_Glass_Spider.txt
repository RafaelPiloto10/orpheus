Up until one century ago there lived,  
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country  
A glass-like spider.  
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,  
In weeks creating a macabre  
  
Shrine of remains  
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,  
Like floors in a building  
  
At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent  
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.  
One could almost call it an altar.  
When the breeze blew through this construction,  
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.  
Tiny wails, tiny cries.  
  
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically  
For their mother.  
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies  
Would survive someone on their own.  
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.  
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.  
  
Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you  
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)  
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell  
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)  
Take care, take care.  
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)  
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.  
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.  
  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
  
Gone, Gone the water's all gone  
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone  
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid  
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake  
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.  
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might  
Gone, gone, the water's all gone  
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone  
  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
  
Gone gone the water's all gone  
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
