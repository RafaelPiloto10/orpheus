You live in a world of fantasy  
You live in a web of deceit  
You want it all including me  
You like it all to be neat  
I come to you when shadows fall  
I leave as the dawn arrives  
Hide the truth to deceive them all  
How my good intention lies  
Try to silence the suspicions  
Feeding the dark inhibitions  
We can never let anyone see  
The sin I bring called ecstasy  
The sin I bring ecstasy  
Secret meetings that we hide  
Deeds of iniquity  
The price of foolish pride  
The cost of immorality  
And we hide the truth to deceive them all  
And the pain of what will never be  
Try to silence the suspicions  
Feeding the dark inhibitions  
We can never let anyone see  
The sin I bring called ecstasy  
The sin I bring ecstasy
