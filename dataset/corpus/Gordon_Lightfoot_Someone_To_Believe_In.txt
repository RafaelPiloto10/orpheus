Is there someone I can believe in?  
Is there somewhere I can hide?  
Take me out of the straits, I'm in  
Come and stay here by my side  
Somebody I can rely on  
I broke the law, I've been set free  
Give me something to decide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewing seams?  
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams  
You know, living a life of ease  
Don't make your meals taste better if you please  
Is there someone I can relate to?  
Who will break the ice for me?  
Take me out of the place I'm in  
Come and share yer life with me  
Somebody with nothing to live up to  
Who will mend my broken dreams?  
Give me a wave, I can ride upon  
Come and show yer strength to me  
I have felt the final rush of love's embrace  
The magic touch, running headlong to attract  
I felt the breath of Satan on my back  
Is there someone I can believe in?  
Is there something I can do?  
Take me out of the straits I'm in  
Let me show myself to you  
Somebody to whom I can belong  
Take my hand, I've been set free  
Give me some wings, I can glide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewings seams  
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams  
You know, living a life of ease  
Don't make yer meals taste better if you please
