Well, I wake up burnin' in a soaking sweat  
My pillows are drippin' and the sheets are wet  
I jump out of bed and I turn on the light  
This happens to me every night  
Sometimes you turn into a snake with long black hair  
Then you turn into an angel, blonde and fair  
You can turn yourself blue and I don't care  
You can change your look  
You can change your race  
But it's always your touch  
And always your face  
  
[Chorus:]  
Dirty dreams  
How you want to do me  
Dirty dreams  
Let me get through  
Dirty dreams  
A triple X-rated movie starring me and you  
  
Well, I close my eyes  
And you open your lips  
There's a shock from my head to my fingertips  
I fall through a hole 'cause I can't get a grip  
The room starts to spin and the world starts to turn  
My heart catches fire and my bed starts to burn  
  
Dirty dreams  
How you want do me  
Dirty dreams  
Anything for you, babe  
Dirty dreams  
Technicolor movie starring me and you  
Make my dreams come true  
  
Shake my nights  
Rattle my sleep  
Roll my eyes, I'm in too deep  
  
[Chorus]
