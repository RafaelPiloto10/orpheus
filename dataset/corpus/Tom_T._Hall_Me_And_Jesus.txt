[Chorus]  
Me and Jesus, got our own thing goin'  
Me and Jesus, got it all worked out  
Me and Jesus, got our own thing goin'  
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about  
  
[1st Verse]  
I know a man, who once was a sinner  
I know a man, who once was a drunk  
And I know a man, who once was a looser  
He went out one day and made an alter out of a stump  
  
[2nd Verse]  
Jesus brought me through all of my troubles  
Jesus brought me through all of my trials  
Jesus brought me through all of my heartaches  
And I know that Jesus ain't gonna' forsake me now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[3rd Verse]  
We can't afford any fancy preachin'  
We can't afford any fancy church  
We can't afford any fancy singin'  
You know Jesus got a lot of poor people out doin' his work  
  
[Chorus]
