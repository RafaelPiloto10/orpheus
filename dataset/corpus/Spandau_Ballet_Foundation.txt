Hello, this is me to you  
It's better now we're comin' through  
And I don't really know just who we are  
I'll stay here till my love's full up  
So stir this cocktail, shake me up  
Drink me down and take me from the bar  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
You know we got to build, build it up  
Spent the night in Tumbledown  
A hundred miles from west of town  
Plans were laid, no compromise was made  
Gently up to meet the blue  
Left a note and signed it "True"  
Those construction games were all we played  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Yeah we're gonna build, build it up  
Oh, I know you're gonna give your best  
So more or less, gotta put it to the test  
Don't you know, you've got the whole world in your hands  
Surrender up and lay down your arms  
The fightin' hurts but the lovin' calms  
Oh, I know you've got the whole world in your hands  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
You know we got to build, build it up  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation, build it up  
Build a foundation, build it up  
You know we got to build  
...
