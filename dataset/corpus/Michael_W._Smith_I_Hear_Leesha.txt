Seems like it was only yesterday  
She was living here  
Yea, she was living here  
Lord knows why He's taken her away  
It isn't very clear, no it isn't very clear  
Into every life a little rain must fall  
And losing one you love is like a storm  
But storms are passing  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear Leesha  
Singing in heaven tonight  
And in between the sadness  
I hear Leesha  
Telling me that she's alright  
  
Life goes on even after life  
That's what I believe  
Yea, that's what I believe  
Leesha's gone, but she will still survive  
In a memory that I'm keeping here with me  
Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy  
Listening to whispers of the soul  
All is peaceful  
  
[Chorus]
