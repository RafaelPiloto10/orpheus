One time I spent a week inside a little country jail  
And I don't guess I'll ever live it down  
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me  
And said that I was speeding through their town  
  
Well, they said,tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go.  
They let me call one person on the phone  
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss  
To tell him I'd be off but not for long  
  
Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys  
One little barred up window in the rear  
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in  
We ought to send the jailer for some beer  
  
Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge  
And the jailer's job was not the best in town  
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy  
The first day I was there I turned it down  
  
Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early  
Wonderin' when I'd get my release  
Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy  
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please  
  
Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten  
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw  
He said, where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis?  
I'd like to talk to him about the law.  
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady  
And I really should be gettin' on my way  
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him  
He said, the judge'll be here any day.  
  
The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful  
But she brought that hot bologna every day  
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better  
I asked her if she'd like to run away  
  
The next mornin' that old judge took every nickel that I had  
And he said, son, let this teach you not to race.  
The jailer's wife was smilin' from the window as I left  
In thirty minutes I was out of state
