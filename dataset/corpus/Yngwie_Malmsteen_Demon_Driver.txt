My one way ride in dead end street  
Leading to victory and glory  
You seek I hide you'll find defeat  
My future's in the hands of fury  
You try - but never win  
Can't you see I am the demon driver  
Don't lie it is a sin  
'cause you know I am the demon driver  
I live to drive and never wait  
For guardian angels riding by me  
To speed or die I'm never late  
Wherever you are there will be  
You try - but never win  
Can't you see I am the demon driver  
Don't lie it is a sin  
'cause you know I am the demon driver  
My one way ride in dead end street  
Leading to victory and glory  
You seek I hide you'll find defeat  
My future's in the hands of fury  
You try - but never win  
Can't you see I am the demon driver  
Don't lie it is a sin  
'cause you know I am the demon driver
