Look up in the sky, up towards the north  
There are three new stars, brightly shining forth  
They're shining oh-so bright from heaven above  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love  
  
Ritchie, you were just starting to realise your dreams  
Everyone calls me a kid, but you were only seventeen  
Now Almighty God has called you, from oh-so far away  
Maybe it's to save some boy or girl  
Who might have gone astray  
And with your star shining through the dark and lonely night  
To light the path and show the way, the way that's right  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love  
  
Buddy, I can still see you, with that shy grin on your face  
Seems like your hair was always a little messed up  
And kinda outa place  
Now, not many people actually knew you or  
Understood how you felt  
But just a song, just a song from you  
Could make the coldest heart melt  
Well you're singing for God now, in his chorus in the sky  
Buddy Holly, I'll always remember you with tears in my eyes  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love  
  
I see a stout man, the Big Bopper's your name  
God called you to heaven, maybe for new fortune and fame  
Keep wearing that big Stetson hat and ramble up to the mike  
And don't forget those wonderful words, you know what I like  
  
Look up in the sky, up towards the north  
There are three new stars, brightly shining forth  
They' re shining oh-so bright from heaven above  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love
