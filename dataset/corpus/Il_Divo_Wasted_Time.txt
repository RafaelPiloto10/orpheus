Well baby, there you stand  
With your little head, down in your hand  
Oh, my God, you can't believe  
It's happening again  
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone  
And it looks like the end.  
  
And you're back out on the street.  
And you're tryin' to remember.  
How will you start it over?  
You don't know if you can.  
You don't care much for a stranger's touch,  
But you can't hold your man.  
  
You never thought you'd be alone  
This far down the line  
And I know what's been on your mind  
You're afraid it's all been wasted time  
  
The autumn leaves have got you thinking  
About the first time that you fell  
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no  
You just loved the boy too well, farewell  
So you live from day to day, and you dream  
About tomorrow, oh.  
  
And the hours go by like minutes  
And the shadows come to stay  
So you take a little something  
To make them go away  
And I could have done so many things, baby  
If I could only stop my mind from wonderin' what  
I left behind and from worrying 'bout this wasted time  
  
Ooh, another love has come and gone  
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on  
I remember what you told me  
Before you went out on your own:  
"Sometimes to keep it together,  
You got to leave it alone."  
  
So you can get on with your search, baby,  
And I can get on with mine  
And maybe someday we will find,  
That it wasn't really wasted time
