Slings and arrows, slings and arrows,  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows.  
No chance for a second chance  
When the arrows start to fly.  
No way is an easy way  
To say goodbye.  
No dream is ever lost  
If you never cease to try.  
Never thought you would walk away  
From my side.  
I just can't hide from  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows,  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows.  
  
Life is ever changing,  
Nothing stays the same,  
Nothing in this whole wide world  
Can turn us back again  
'cause where we're standing now  
Is the point of no return,  
Looking back on a world that's got to learn  
You just can't hide from  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows,  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows.  
  
  
Love is the shield  
When you're standing  
With your back to the wall  
And if you turn around  
And walk away  
You're never gonna lose  
'cause love conquers all.  
  
No chance for a second chance  
When the arrows start to fly.  
No way is an easy way  
To say goodbye.  
No dream is ever lost  
If you never cease to try.  
Never thought you would walk away  
From my side.  
I just can't hide from  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows
