Only my soul, stops me crying,  
Wondering why I feel alone.  
And only my love keeps me from  
Weeping, so bad,  
Giving me strength, to carry on.  
  
Lead me on thro' restless waters,  
Walk with me along the way.  
Live the moment, and tomorrow.  
For the Lord will take it all  
On judgment day.  
  
Broken dreams lay all around me,  
Sad eyed children of despair.  
Whispered voices in the distance  
Call me on to who knows where.  
  
Lead me on thro' restless waters,  
Walk with me along the way.  
Live the moment, and tomorrow.  
'Cause the Lord will take it all on judgment day,  
And the Lord will take it all on judgement day.  
  
Hear me crying out for love.  
Hear me crying out for love.  
I'll never let you know it,  
I can only show it in my song.  
  
Only my soul.  
  
Hear me crying out for love.  
Hear me crying out for love.  
I'll never let you know it,  
I can only show it in my song.  
Only my soul
