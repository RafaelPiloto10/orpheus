Turn it inside out so I can see  
The part of you that's driftin over me  
'Cause when I look you're never there  
But when I sleep you're everywhere  
You're everywhere  
  
Tell me how I got this far  
Tell me why you're here and who you are  
'Cause everytime I look  
You're never there  
And everytime I sleep  
You're always there  
  
'Cause you're everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
It's you I see  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
  
I recognized the way you make me feel  
It's hard to think that you might not be real  
I sense it now the water's getting deep  
I try to wash the pain away from me  
Away from me  
  
'Cause you're everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
It's you I see  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
I'm not alone  
  
When I touch your hand  
It's then I understand  
The beauty lies within  
It's now that we begin  
You always light my way  
Whenever comes a day  
No matter where I go  
I always feel you so  
  
'Cause you're everywhere to me  
And when I close my eyes  
It's you I see  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
  
You're everywhere to me  
And when I catch my breath  
It's you I breathe  
You're everything I know  
That makes me believe  
I'm not alone  
  
And you're everyone I see,  
So tell me, do you see me?
