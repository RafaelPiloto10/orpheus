It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye  
Or maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cry  
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
He took a plane across the sea to some foreign land  
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand  
How someone who had been so close could be so far away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
She doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrong  
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long  
And she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away  
Because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday  
  
The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone  
Talking to a memory that's never coming home  
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say  
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday  
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday
