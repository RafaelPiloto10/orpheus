The sun is out  
The clouds are slowly going  
And now my heart is growing fast  
So let's get up  
Put on you hat and clothing  
Let's take a trip and lose our minds  
  
Let's go walking through the park today  
I love sunday mondays any day  
When the skies are blue and it's not grey  
I'll take sunday mondays any every day  
  
Sometimes it's fun  
To just escape and run  
And leave the troubled world behind  
So let's get lost  
And get our juices flowing  
And let's go see what we can find  
  
Let's go walking through the park today  
I love sunday mondays any day  
When the skies are blue and it's not grey  
I'll take sunday mondays any every day  
  
Let's go walking through the park today  
I love sunday mondays any day  
When the skies are blue and it's not grey  
I'll take sunday mondays any every day
