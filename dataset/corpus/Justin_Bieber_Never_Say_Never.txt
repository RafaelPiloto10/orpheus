Never say never (never never never)  
  
You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)  
I never thought that I could take the burn  
I never had the strength to take it higher  
Until I reach the point of no return  
  
And there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
It's my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
Never say it, never, never say it  
  
I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)  
I never thought that I could feel this free  
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower  
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)  
  
'Cause there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
'Cause this is my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Here we go  
Guess who?  
J-Smith and J-B!  
I gotcha lil' bro  
I can handle him  
Hold up, aight?  
I can handle him  
  
Now he's bigger than me  
Taller than me  
And he's older than me  
And stronger than me  
And his arms a little bit longer than me  
But he ain't on a J-B song with me  
  
I be trying to chill  
They try to sour the thrill  
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will  
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove  
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)  
  
I gotta be the best, and yes  
We're the fliest  
Like David and Goliath,  
I conquered the giant  
So now I got the world in my hand,  
I was born from two stars  
So the moon is where I land  
(I'm gone)  
  
Yeah  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Never say never  
  
I will never say never (never say never)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
  
And never say never (ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
And never say never
