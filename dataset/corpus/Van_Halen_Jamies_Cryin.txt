She saw the look in his eyes, 'n' she knew better  
He wanted her tonight, ah, and it was now or never  
He made her feel so sad  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
  
Now Jamie wouldn't say, "All right", ah, she knew he'd forget her  
'N' so they said goodnight, ah, oh, 'n' now he's gone forever  
She want's to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah  
Uh just to try to make herself feel better  
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")  
But she knows what that'll get her  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
  
Now Jamie's been in love before (ahhh)  
And she knows what love is for (ahhh)  
It should mean, a little, a little more (ahhh)  
Than one night stands, whoo  
  
She want's to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah  
Just to try to make herself feel better  
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")  
But she knows what that'll get her  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
