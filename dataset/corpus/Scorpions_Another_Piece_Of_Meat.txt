Met her down at that Tokyo place  
Loved her pretty face  
I said: "Hey, you're alright, so alright!"  
I was sitting in her car  
She told me: "You're a star and I know you."  
  
She said: "Take me home."  
I need love so strong  
Come on and knock me out, oh!  
I've been too long alone  
I want hot love, you know, and I need it now!"  
  
She said: "Hey, let's go, don't put on a show  
You're just another piece, another piece of meat"  
She said: "Hey, let's go, don't put on a show  
You're just another piece  
Another piece of meat."  
  
Next day she took me out  
To a rough kick boxing show  
Violence really turned her on, oh no  
She was screaming for more blood  
Loved it more than any drug I couldn't stand it  
  
I said: "Hey, let's go, don't put on a show  
You're just another piece, another piece of meat"  
Said: "Hey, let's go, don't put on a show  
You're just another piece  
Another piece of meat."
