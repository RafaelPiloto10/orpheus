The table's set for 2 but I'm the only one  
That's how you left me here with a smoking gun  
Thought we were solid wood but we are plastic trees  
I swear I hear you laughing cause the joke's on me  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you  
  
But I saw your colors in a shining light  
But it was just a sketch of you in black and white  
What kind of crazy spell did you leave me on  
It takes some kiss and tell and then you were gone  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose  
  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you...
