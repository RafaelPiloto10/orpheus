Loud talk  
Dumb love  
Lacerator  
Come and, touch  
  
Bleed to feel  
Feel to fuck  
Keep ya comin'  
Keep ya comin' back for, more  
  
Alcohol  
It's a lie  
Stimulate  
A needle in your, eye  
  
Let it bleed  
Blow your mind  
Touched myself  
Nearly went blind  
  
[Chorus]  
Couldn't find a way  
To live through the pain  
Couldn't find a way  
(Dumb love)  
Couldn't find a way  
To win the ra-ace  
Couldn't find a way  
(Dumb love)  
  
Couldn't get  
Outta bed  
Ten ton bricks  
Layin' on my, head  
  
Persecute  
The crucified  
Kill a man  
For losing his mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on out  
You're comin' home  
Deceive yourself  
You're all alone [Repeat: x4]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on out  
You're comin' home  
Deceive yourself  
You're all alone [Repeat: x4]
