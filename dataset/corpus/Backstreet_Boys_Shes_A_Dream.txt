Oh  
Oh  
Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh no  
Yeah  
  
Shorty ain't got cable,  
She ain't even got a radio, way more than able.  
What kinda girl should I take her for?  
The perfect kind, just what I like,  
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream  
She's a dream, yeah  
  
Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.  
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,  
I'm first class every flight.  
If she takes the time to open her eyes,  
She can realize that she's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
  
'Cause Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
But Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
That's why I make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
  
Shorty don't know who I am  
  
And I'm cool with that, if she says so  
I ain't even got a lot to her  
And when I'm out making pesos?  
Ain't' nobody treat her like I do her.  
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,  
The only one on her mind,  
She's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
And Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,  
Like three or four times a week  
She don't even know I've been around the world  
And all the different girls I meet.  
But there's just one, face that I see  
She's the only one for me  
She's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
  
'Cuase Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
That's why I make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
(She's a dream)  
  
See, shorty don't know who I am  
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,  
It's not good to fuss  
And I know she loves me, for me  
And I love her, for her  
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave  
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me  
  
She don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
Oh,  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
  
'Bout me  
(She's a dream)
