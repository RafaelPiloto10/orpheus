And today we'll drown in your tears  
A drop of your blood tastes like wine today  
  
And because I love you so  
And I'm here for you  
Save your happiness for tomorrow  
And today we'll drown in your tears  
A drop of your blood tastes like wine today  
Save your happiness for tomorrow

Will you let it rain  
Let it rain  
So won't you let it rain  
Oh, let it rain  
Won't you let it rain
