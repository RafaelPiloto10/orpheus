One, two, one, two, three, four  
Sick of leaving in the morning  
With the night you gave away, yeah  
So now I'm gonna take that all that I can get  
With those angel eyes  
You make saints do sins all the time  
Say I'm gonna stay, home and away, well well,  
When I said I?d catch you when you're falling  
Have my heart open wide  
And you who's not naive I thought  
Say I?d thought I?d mend my heart  
Oh people say I'm so automatic  
People say I'm not so systematic  
When I'm down I'm in manual, Lord  
And time on time again I walk on by  
With the look of love  
And with those angel eyes, woh woh  
You set me on fire baby  
And with those angel eyes, woh woh  
See'mon now lady  
The saddest thing I've ever seen on my TV screen  
Was a dying man who died for his dream  
The toughest thing I've ever heard  
Was that new-born scream in this naked world, yeah  
And people say that I'm so automatic  
People say I'm not so systematic  
When I'm down I'm in manual, Lord  
Been all around those edges  
But ain't never been in love  
Ain't never been in love with ya lady  
And with ya lady  
Gonna tell the world  
Gonna tell the world  
Gonna tell the world  
Gonna tell the world  
I love her, baby
