I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
Oh what heartache  
Oh what heartbreak  
Following me  
Calling to me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness  
  
See what I've prayed  
Hear what loves sings  
Sad melodies  
Enticing me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness
