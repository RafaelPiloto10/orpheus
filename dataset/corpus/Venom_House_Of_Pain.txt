I could hear you screaming  
Heard you cry in pain  
But I thought you were dreaming  
Are you going insane?  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
You're insane  
I could feel you dying  
Again and again and again  
I believed you were lying  
Now I know you're insane  
House of pain  
I could see you bleeding  
Feel you die in vain  
As your flesh started seething  
In your house of pain  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
I'm insane  
Welcome to the house of pain
