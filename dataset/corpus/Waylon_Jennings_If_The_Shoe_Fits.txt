My friends all say that you're deceiving me  
And things are going on that I don't see  
I pay them no mind I love you so  
And if you're guilty then I just don't want to know.  
  
But if the shoe fits then wear it  
If your mind hurts then bear it  
It's your conscience to live with every day every night  
If you find it hard sleeping  
If you just lie there weeping  
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right.  
  
If you do wrong then it's your bill to pay  
It's you there in that mirror every day  
I love you and I plan to from now on  
I just can't believe you do your daddy wrong.  
  
But if the shoe fits then wear it  
If your mind hurts then bear it  
It's your conscience to live with every day every night  
If you find it hard sleeping  
If you just lie there weeping  
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right.  
  
If the truth hurts then the shoe fits just right
