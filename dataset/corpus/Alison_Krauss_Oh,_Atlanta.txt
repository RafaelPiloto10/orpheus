Same old place  
Same old city  
What can I do?  
I'm falling in love  
  
I'm just an old hound dog  
Roaming around, oh Lord  
I've got all this and Heaven above  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
I get a feeling in me  
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights  
Can't you hear the music playing?  
You must have heard them saying  
We're gonna rip 'em up and light up the night  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
Same old place  
It's the same old city  
What can I do?  
I'm falling in love  
  
I'm just an old hound dog  
Roaming around, Lord, Lord  
I've got all this and Heaven above  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
Hear me calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day, hey  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia
