I hope you hear this 'cause I'm about to say it now  
Guess I'm to blame and it's just a shame  
Cause I had the chance to tell you what you meant  
But I lived my life thinking I had time  
And that in my mind I'd get to it  
  
Now you've gone away, not a single day goes by  
When I don't think about it  
Your spirit's all around, I can say it now  
I hope you hear this  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
So oh, I've got to tell everybody  
Don't make the same mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
It's alright to say I love you out loud  
And it's all good, so don't you keep it inside  
Let it out, do it today  
No no no, don't you wait  
Cause it just might be too late  
To say I love you  
  
Don't walk a mile inside my shoes  
Cause if you do, you're gonna regret it  
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be  
Here or there tomorrow  
  
Why you want to wait, communicate  
Don't assume that they already know  
How much, how much you're really feeling  
And you really, really love them  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
It's like I would tell anybody  
Don't make the same mistake like I did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Those three words make all the difference in the world  
You might wait and miss your chance  
So don't be scared to say what you're feeling  
You can't turn back the hands of time  
If you get the chance, do it right  
Let it out, say it now  
Say it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm ready  
Ready to shout it out, shout it out loud  
So ready  
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now  
But I waited too late  
So today I won't make the same mistake, no  
I won't do it, and if I get the chance I'll say it  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
It's alright
