  
  
  
I'm sitting in my chair watching the TV  
It's not even on but there's plenty for me to see  
I just lit some crazy ass shit  
that my friend overnight mailed to me  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever tasted  
I think they fucking laced it  
Cause I'm so damn lambasted  
  
Oh my friend came over so I packed him a pipe  
I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype  
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it  
Two minutes later he was playing backgammon naked  
  
He's fucking wasted  
It's the best shit he ever tasted  
He's lost in fucking spaced-ed  
Cause he's so wicked wicked wasted  
  
Oh I spent the last two hours  
hiding under my bed  
Cause I looked in the garbage can  
and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
  
Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face  
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moonwalk all over the place  
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak  
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I've ever tasted  
My brain's been erased-ed  
Well fucking fried  
  
I'm sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat  
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet  
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe  
I said we ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever fucking tasted  
Oh fucking shit  
  
I'm way too baked
