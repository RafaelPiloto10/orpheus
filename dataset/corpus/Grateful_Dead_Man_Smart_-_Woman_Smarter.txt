Let us put men and women together, see which one is smarter,  
Some say men, but I say no, women got the men like a puppet show.  
  
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray,  
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way,  
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right.  
  
Little boy sitting in the corner and cry, big man come and ask him why,  
He said "I can't do what the big boys do", the man sat down and he cried too.  
  
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray,  
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way.  
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right  
  
Ever since the world began women been imitating the ways of men,  
But listen cause I've got a plan, give it up just don't try to understand.  
  
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray,  
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way.  
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right
