Let it ride  
How did everything get messed up?  
Let it go  
Now I got myself all stressed out  
Hold on to my hand, I'll show you where to go  
Take you anywhere you want to go  
Take a ride  
Now that everything is fucked up  
Take it slow  
And I got you all stressed out  
It's out of your hands and I know you wanted more  
What did you want it  
Four shots of Jack just to relax and get my head straight  
Wait for a sign a reason not to escape  
Meditate, point break, mistake  
Cigarette burns while my hand shakes  
You can't go back  
Tomorrow brings another day  
Another chance, some other way  
And time won't stop for you  
Not even if you want it to  
Let it ride  
Try to tell myself to hold on  
Let it go  
But I always to let myself down  
Thought that you had it down but now you just don't know  
Bottom dropped  
I spun so fast that I lost my bearings  
Gather myself while everyone is staring  
Have been asleep while my patience runs thin  
Damn, what the fuck did I get myself in  
And I miss my best friend  
Cause we don't hang out anymore  
I'm gonna sit and watch the waves crash on the shore  
Break my fall and I'm just gonna kick it on the floor  
Forevermore  
[Repeat Chorus]  
And I stopped keeping score  
Is that what you're looking for?  
And I stopped keeping score  
Start over  
[x2]  
[Repeat Chorus]
