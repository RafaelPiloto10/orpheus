I had known you for quite sometime,  
But the thought of love never crossed my mind.  
It seemed to be on the other side of the world.  
  
Too many times had I loved,  
And not cared at all about love.  
Just to have something to do.  
Then I saw a different you,  
And, oh, my.  
  
There's so many stories of love,  
All with the wonders of love.  
And so very sad I would be,  
'Cause none belonged to me.  
Could be it's all for the voice,  
So I finally let it rest.  
Sad but I thought that maybe  
Love wasn't meant for me...  
  
There was love.  
There was love.  
There was love,  
On the other  
Side of the world.  
  
So much love.  
So much love.  
So much love,  
On the other  
Side of the world.  
  
I had known you for quite sometime,  
And the thought of love never crossed my mind.  
It seemed to be on the other side  
Of the world.  
  
So crazy how things can change your life.  
Now that love is you, everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
Ain't it crazy how things can change your life?  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
So crazy how things can change your life.  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
Ain't it crazy how things can change your life?  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
So crazy how things can change your life.  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world.  
Of the world.  
Of the world.
