Looking from a window above, it's like a story of love  
Can you hear me  
Came back only yesterday  
I'm moving further away  
Want you near me  
  
[Chorus]  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew  
Only you  
  
Sometimes when I think of her name when it's only a game  
And I need you  
Listen to the words that you say it's getting harder to stay  
When I see you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is going to take a long time and I wonder what's mine  
Can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand it's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
[Chorus]
