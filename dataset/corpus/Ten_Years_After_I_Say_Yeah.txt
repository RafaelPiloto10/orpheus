When I ask questions, don't tell no lies  
Just look me in the eyes  
Don't say no and don't say maybe  
And don't ask me why  
Just say yeah, yes, yes is what to say  
Just say yeah, yes, and go along your way, ooh baby now  
  
When you need me, well I'll come running  
And that's the way to be  
Just call on me when you want some loving  
And I'll give it all for free  
I'll say yeah, yes, yes is what to say  
I'll say yeah, yes, and we'll go along a way, ooh baby now  
  
Well, we don't need no shove  
Cause I just fall in love with you, child  
Well we don't need no push  
Cause we just dig the rush with you
