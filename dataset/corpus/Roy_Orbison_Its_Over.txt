Your baby doesn't love you any more  
Golden days before they end  
Whisper secrets to the wind  
Your baby won't be near you any more  
  
Tender nights before they fly  
Send falling stars that seem to cry  
Your baby doesn't want you any more  
It's over  
  
It breaks your heart in two, To know she's been untrue  
But oh what will you do? Then she said to you  
There's someone new We're through We're through  
It's over It's over It's over  
  
All the rainbows in the sky Start to even say goodbye  
You won't be seeing rainbows any more  
Setting suns before they fall, Echo to you that's all that's all  
But you'll see lonely sunset after all  
  
It's over It's over It's over It's over
