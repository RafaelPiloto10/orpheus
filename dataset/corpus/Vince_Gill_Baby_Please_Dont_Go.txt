Baby please don't go, baby please don't go  
Don't you leave me here feelin' lonely  
Don't you leave me here feelin' low  
All I know is what I know  
And I know, I love you so  
Baby don't go, baby please don't go  
I wasn't ready for love to hit me  
Hit me right between the eyes  
One by one I'm comin' undone  
Can't you feel my temperature rise?  
Well I've got you where you want me  
Right in the palm of your hand  
I'm gonna make you feel like a woman  
'Cause you make me feel like a man  
Baby please don't go, baby please don't go  
Don't you leave me here feelin' lonely  
Don't you leave me here feelin' low  
All I know is what I know  
And I know, I love you so  
Baby don't go, baby please don't go  
Lock your eyes right with me  
Make time slow down to a crawl  
Two hearts on fire with a wild desire  
Climbin' these bedroom walls  
My heartbeat's gettin' stronger  
Baby, won't you rock me slow?  
I can't take it any longer  
You got me shakin' all the way to my toes  
Baby please don't go, baby please don't go  
Don't you leave me here feelin' lonely  
Don't you leave me here feelin' low  
All I know is what I know  
And I know, I love you so  
Baby don't go, baby please don't go
