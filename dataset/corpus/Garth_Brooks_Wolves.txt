January's always bitter  
But Lord, this one beats all  
The wind ain't quit for weeks now  
And the drifts are ten feet tall  
I been all night drivin' heifers  
Closer in to lower ground  
Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'  
'Bout the ones the wolves pulled down  
Charlie Barton and his family  
Stopped today to say goodbye  
He said the bank was takin' over  
The last few years were just too dry  
And I promised that I'd visit  
When they found a place in town  
Then I spent a long time thinkin'  
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down  
Lord, please shine a light of hope  
On those of us who fall behind  
And when we stumble in the snow  
Could you help us up while there's still time  
Well, I don't mean to be complainin'  
LordYou've always seen me through  
And I know you got your reasons  
For each and every thing you do  
But tonight outside my window  
There's a lonesome, mournful sound  
And I just can't keep from thinkin'  
'Bout the ones the wolves pull down  
Oh Lord, keep me from bein'  
The one the wolves pull down
