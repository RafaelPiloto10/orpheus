One affair won't make a lover,  
Kisses never meant that you were givin' up your soul.  
I want to taste the spice of another,  
I wanna' taste my life, so, I remember when I'm old.  
Why I'm ...  
  
  
I'm runnin' through my lifetime,  
You can see it your way and I'll see it mine.  
I'm runnin' through my lifetime,  
I've got to stay out in the race so I don't go out of my mind.  
  
  
Hunger in the eyes of the teacher,  
Today he wants to feel the things his mamma made him hide.  
Now it's comin out all over that old preacher,  
Livin' never meant no more than waitin til' he dies.  
So I'm ...  
  
  
I'm runnin' through my lifetime,  
I'm runnin' fast, I won't get far behind.  
I'm runnin' through my lifetime,  
I've got to stay out in the race so I don't go out of my mind.  
  
  
Beware! beware!  
I'm a friend to those who share me and I'm a threat to those who dare me.  
Beware! beware!  
I can help if you need me and I can run if you try to keep me.  
  
  
I'm runnin' through my lifetime,  
You can see it your way and I'll see it mine.  
I'm runnin' through my lifetime,  
I've got to stay out in the race so I don't know go out of my mind.  
  
  
I'm runnin', I'm runnin', runnin', runnin'.  
Runnin'.  
...?  
Runnin'.  
Runnin'.  
... kisses never meant that I would give you my soul.  
Runnin'.  
Runnin'.  
... I want to taste the spice.  
Runnin'.  
... I want to taste my life.  
Runnin'.  
So, I'll remember when I'm old,  
Runnin'.  
Runnin'.  
...?  
Runnin'.  
...?  
Runnin'.  
...?  
Runnin'.
