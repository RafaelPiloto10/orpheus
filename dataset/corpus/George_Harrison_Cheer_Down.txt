I can see by your grin  
That you're trembling within  
It's all over town, cheer down  
And the smile on your face  
Is sometimes out of place  
Don't mind, no frowns, cheer down.  
  
If your hair should fall  
If your shares should crash  
You'll get by even without getting a rash  
  
There's no tears to be shed  
I'm gonna love you instead  
I want you around, cheer down.  
  
When your teeth drop out  
You'll get by even without taking a bite  
  
If your dog should be dead  
I'm gonna love you instead  
The world loves a clown, cheer down.  
I want you around, cheer down
