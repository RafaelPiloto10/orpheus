Divorce Party  
It is not the 4th of July  
But we're celebrating Mr bb and Mrs bb have decided to call it a day  
After so many years, living together  
They have called us here today  
To witness what they call freedom from each other  
They've been living in style, they wanna end it in style  
They wanna end it with a bang.  
  
Chorus  
Divorce party, divorce party  
  
We see them now  
In the middle of the room  
Holding glasses so high  
They not renewing their sacred vows, not at all  
But they're telling everybody  
What they didn't like about each other  
One says, do you remember that day I said that  
Do you remember that day (x2) you did that  
I hope our paths will never meet again
