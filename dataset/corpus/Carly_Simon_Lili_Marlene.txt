Outside the barracks by the corner light  
Darling I remember how I'd wait for you at night  
There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you  
The whole night through, was there that you'd whisper tenderly  
That you loved me, you'd always be  
Be my Lili Marlene, be my Lili Marlene  
  
I'd give you a rose to show I care,  
And wind it through your golden hair  
Then we would say goodnight and part,  
I'll always keep you in my heart  
With me Lili Marlene, with me Lili Marlene  
  
My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene
