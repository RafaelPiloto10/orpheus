Give me all your money, any time I ask  
Desperate situation, rally to the task  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God  
Warm you till you can sleep at night  
  
Somewhere in your memory  
Lies the dormant seed  
Pacify your guilt now, and satisfy my greed  
Playing God, climb the golden ladder  
Playing God  
Warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
  
Between the ether and the opium lies the land of no regret  
Of what we are and what we might become  
Are we walking on the water yet?  
  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God, warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
Playing God, climb the golden ladder  
Playing God  
  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God, warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
Playing God
