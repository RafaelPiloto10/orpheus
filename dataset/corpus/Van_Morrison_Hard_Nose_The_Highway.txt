Hey kids dig the first takes  
Ain't that some inspiration  
When Sinatra sings against Nelson Riddle strings  
Then takes a vacation  
  
Seen some hard times  
Drawn some bad lines  
No time for shoeshines  
Hard nose the highway  
  
I was tore down at the dead's place  
Shaved head at the organ  
But that wasn't half as bad as it was oh no  
Belfast and Boston  
  
Put your money where your mouth is  
Then we can get something going  
In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime  
And leave one or two cards showing
