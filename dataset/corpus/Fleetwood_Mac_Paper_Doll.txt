You like a man with a future  
You like a woman with a past  
Well do you really believe that  
She said to faces in the crowd  
  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
  
And even if you did miss me  
You never let me know  
You prefer to be just a little bit  
In and out of love with me  
And not to scream and shout  
You prefer to be just a little bit  
In and out of agony  
  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
  
Come on now, let the sad winds blow down  
As the rain came, she refused to wear her coat  
But deep in her heart she knew, that the song must go on  
  
He says well I have forgotten you  
And your beautiful eyes  
We were off the wall  
We were mirrors of our former selves  
  
Well you could have said no  
You could have said well I just can't  
Whoa we were off the wall  
We were mirrors of each other  
Passing by  
  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
  
Well I was your paper doll  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Paper doll  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Well I was you paper doll  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Paper doll  
  
And it doesn't even matter  
(I was fascinated by somebody else)  
It was a real clear answer  
(I was fascinated by somebody else)  
I was fascinated by somebody else  
(I was fascinated by somebody else)
