Smile an everlasting smile a smile could bring you near to me  
Don't ever let me find you're gone cause that would bring a tear to me  
This world has lost its glory let's start a brand new story now my love  
Right now there'll be no other time and I can show you all my love  
  
Talk an everlasting words and dedicate them all to me  
And I will give you all my love I'm here if you should call to me  
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away  
  
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away  
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away
