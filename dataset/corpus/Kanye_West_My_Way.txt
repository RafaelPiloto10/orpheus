I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday  
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it  
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit  
Yeah I've been broke  
Now I'm good bitch  
I ain't no Kennedy  
But I'm hood rich  
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto  
And everybody else, thank you very little  
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path  
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past  
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last  
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though  
We needed cash  
And we need it fast  
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last  
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white  
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white  
Almost  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
Niggaz wanna diss K  
On they're local mix-tapes  
There they go again, lyin' to consumers  
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors  
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya  
A little arrogant with all your compares  
'Cause as far as the Chi  
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap  
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that  
Y'all just talk about my dough  
How I left Chicago  
How I'm the only one eatin'  
Shut your pie hole  
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though  
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro  
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?  
Only difference between you and me, you were gay  
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?  
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
It go my way, Chi-Way  
This way or the highway  
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways  
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way  
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v  
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway  
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay  
We stay 4 stars, all better  
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather  
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better  
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas  
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial  
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's  
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg  
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg  
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg  
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off  
I've lived  
Yes I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each, and every highway  
What more, and what's more than this -  
I did it my way
