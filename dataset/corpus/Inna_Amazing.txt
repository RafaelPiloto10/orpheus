Dangerous feelings break out my soul  
It's just the meaning of being alone  
I need you here wherever you are  
I need you now to take me so far  
I wanna run like the speed of the sound  
I was somewhere, I 'm sure you're around  
You give me now the meaning of life  
  
With you I'm feeling alive  
  
Why you're lookin' like that  
I'm burning like fire  
I wanna be higher  
Just let me know  
Why you're lookin' like that  
You're driving me crazy  
You're lookin' amazing  
  
Why you're lookin' like that  
I'm burning like fire  
I wanna be higher  
Just let me know  
Why you're lookin' like that  
You're driving me crazy  
You're lookin' amazing  
  
Why you're lookin' like that  
I'm burning like fire  
I wanna be higher  
Just let me know  
Why you're lookin' like that  
You're driving me crazy  
You're lookin' amazing
