He had it coming, he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
If you'd been there  
If you'd herd it  
I bet ya, you would have done the same!  
  
You now how people have these little habbits that get you down  
Like bernie,  
Bernie, he liked to chew gum  
No  
Not chew, pop  
So, I came home this one day and I'm really irritated  
And I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy  
And there's bernie lying on the couch, drinking a beer and chewing  
No  
Not chewing, popin'!  
So I said to him, I said  
If you pop that gum one more time,  
And he did  
So, I took the shotgun of the wall and I fired two warning shots  
Into his head!  
  
He had it coming, he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
If you'd been there  
If you'd heard it  
I bet ya, you would have done the same!  
  
I met Esakiel Young at saltlake city about 2 years ago  
And he told me he was single and we hit it of right away  
So, we started living together  
He'd come home, I'd fix him a drink wed have dinner  
And then I found out  
Single he told me  
Single my ass!  
Not only was he married, oh no, he had six wives  
One of thoese mormans you know  
So that night, whe he came home from work I fixed him his drink as usally  
You know, some guys just can't hold there arsenic!  
  
He had it coming, he had it comimg  
He took a power in his stride  
And then he used  
And he abused it  
It was a murder but not a crime  
  
Now I'm standing in the kitchen, carvin' up a chicken for dinner  
Minding my own business  
When in storms my husband wilber in a jealous rage  
You've been screwing the milkman he says  
He was crazy  
And he kept on sayin you've been screwing the milman  
He kept on saying it over again  
You've been screwing the milkman  
Then he ran into my knife  
He ran into my knife 10 times.  
  
If you'd been there, if you'd seen it,  
I bet ya, you would have done the same

My sister veronica and I had this double act  
And my husband charlie traveled around with us  
Now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, backflips, flipflops splits, spread eagles  
One right after the other  
Now, we were staying at the hotel cicero  
You know, boozing, having a few laughs when we runout of ice  
So, I go out to get some  
And when I came back, I open the door  
And I see  
Veronica and charlie doin number 17  
The spread eagle.  
Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completly blacked out, I can't
remember a thing  
And it wasn't til later, when I was washing the blood of my hands  
I even knew they were dead!  
  
They had it comeing, they had it coming  
They had it coming all along  
I didn't do it, but if I'd done it  
How could you tell me that I was wrong x2  
  
I loved elle lipshitz more then I could possibly say  
He was a sensetive guy  
A painter  
Everynight he went out looking for himself  
And on the way, he found,  
Ruth, gladis, rosemary and Irving  
You could say we broke up coz of artistic differences  
He saw himself alive,  
I saw him dead  
  
The dirty bum bum bum bum bum x2  
  
He had it coming, he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
Because he used us  
And he abused us  
It was a murder but not a crime  
  
He had it coming, he had it coming  
He had it coming all along  
We didn't do it  
But if we'd done it  
How could you tell us that we were wrong.
