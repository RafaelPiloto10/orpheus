Oh, it's so good to see you  
I couldn't wait another day  
Oh, i hope everyone missed you  
You know they want you to stay  
  
Home in one month  
Couldn't feel better if i tried  
Won't even write  
It's better that'll be a surprise  
I can't expect to be a household word  
I don't mind, just let me inside  
I don't expect to be seen or heard  
I won't mind, i've nothin' to hide  
  
Oh, it's so good to see you  
I couldn't wait another day  
So good to see you  
Oh, i hope everyone missed you  
You know they want you to stay  
  
Home in one week  
Gettin' so much closer all the time  
Seems like overnight  
It's better that'll be a surprise  
  
We shouldn't get to be too close friends  
I don't mind, i've nothin' to hide  
We couldn't get to be too close friends  
You won't mind if you've nothin' to hide  
  
Oh, it's so good to see you  
I couldn't wait another day  
So good to see you  
Oh, i hope everyone missed you  
You know they want you to stay  
  
Don't stop to think what you're doin'  
I'll surprise you anytime  
Don't stop to do what you're thinkin'  
You're just wastin' your time  
  
Ooh, it's so good to see you  
I couldn't wait another day  
So good to see you  
Oh, i hope everyone missed you  
I really want you to stay
