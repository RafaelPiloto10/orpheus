This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!  
  
Hollyrock ain't all it seems (Lordy)  
Don't get too serious, it's just a dream  
Don't forget your friends, they're all you've got (Lordy)  
Listen to the story of a man I am not  
  
Party all night, hangin' out  
In the streets more than I be at home  
I take a pill to wipe away my doubts  
But a pill can't cure my bein' alone  
Vodka and seven straight to my brain  
Put me under false impressions, hide all my pain  
Somebody help me, I'm losing control  
  
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!  
  
Everybody got the big dreams (Hey Lordy)  
But nobody got the bucks  
Love and trust will help you make it in a world (Everybody)  
Where there ain't no love, ain't no love  
  
Dig...  
A man came up to me, smile in his eyes  
He told me I was a saint  
So I'm quittin' my friends much to their surprise  
I can't live up to the picture that they paint  
Ah somebody help me, I'm losing control (Ow!)  
  
I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!  
  
Lordy  
La, la, la, la, la (Sucker)  
Got to drive  
[Repeat: 3X]  
(It's just a dream)  
Look out  
  
Do you want to party?  
Do want a pill?  
How about a false impression?  
(Thrills, spills, chills)  
  
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!  
  
Ow! Yeah  
Up a little bit  
(Dream factory, oh)  
Party all night, hang up on the side, I said "Uh"  
(Do you want to party?)  
I can't make up my mind  
(How about a false impression?)  
I can't seem to live with no pictures (Thrills, spills, chills)  
Somebody got to help me! (Just a sucker)  
I'm losing control (Just a sucker)  
I guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!  
  
Guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!  
(Just a sucker, motherfucker!)
