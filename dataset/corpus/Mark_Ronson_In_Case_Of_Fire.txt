[Verse 1]  
Burnin' up, the second Adderall  
To take the edge off the crazy  
Jump out the window, a human cannonball  
Congratulations, baby!  
  
[Chorus]  
Break glass, don't ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan, grab what you can!  
In case of fire  
Girl, you know you gotta burn  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pass like two auras, 2 frozen credit cards  
Another borrowed vacation  
Girl you're a day late, and 20. 000 short  
But let it be your -lizations  
  
[Chorus]  
Break glass, don't ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan, grab what you can!  
In case of fire  
Girl, you know you gotta burn  
  
[Verse 3]  
Bad girl, good moves  
Big dreams, but little fuse  
You start fires that you can't put out  
Just watch it burn! (Let it burn)  
  
A lifetime of heartbreak and outta cigarettes  
A melancholy equation  
Street summer memories, of the day we met  
Could change the radio station  
  
[Chorus X2]  
Break glass, don't ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan, grab what you can!  
In case of fire  
Girl, you know you gotta burn
