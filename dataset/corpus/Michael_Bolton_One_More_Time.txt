Don't look back  
Don't be scared  
We've got dreams and we're still young  
Just think about how far we've come  
  
Think of all  
We have shared  
It's a wonder we survive  
But here we are and we're alive!  
  
Can we hold on, hold on?  
Take a moment to celebrate  
Now before we are gone  
Take a moment to celebrate  
  
There's music in the wind  
Let's dance one more time  
There's a rhythm deep within  
Let's dance one more time  
  
One more time  
Sing the song  
There's a power in our voices  
Hopeful and strong  
  
Years from now  
Somewhere down the line  
We'll remember and we'll all sing  
One more time  
  
[Zulu Chant:]  
See cel la bo lay la
