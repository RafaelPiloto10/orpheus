Something's on my mind  
It's been for quite some time  
This time I'm on to you  
  
So where's the other face  
The face I heard before  
Your head trip's boring me  
  
Let's nuke the bridge we torched 2,000 times before  
This time we'll blast it all to hell  
  
I've had this burning in my gut now for so long  
My belly's aching now to say  
  
Stuck down in a rut  
Of dislogic and smut  
A side of you well hid  
  
When it's all said and done  
It's real and it's been fun  
But was it all real fun?  
  
Let's nuke the bridge we torched 2,000 times before  
This time we'll blast it all to hell  
  
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long  
My belly's aching now to say  
  
To say  
Your just  
A fuck  
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck  
  
I'm taking pride  
In telling you to fuck off and die  
  
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long  
My belly's aching now to say  
  
I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you  
So listen up 'cause you might miss  
  
Your just  
A fuck  
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck  
  
I'm taking pride  
In telling you to fuck off and die  
  
Good night  
  
I was alone  
I was all by myself  
No one was looking  
I was thinking of you  
  
Oh yeah did I mention  
I was all by myself  
All by myself  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I went to your house  
But no one was there  
I went in your room  
I was all by myself  
  
I remember we had  
Such wonderful times  
When I'm all by myself  
All by myself
