I've crossed the high and mighty creek  
That spans the San Farcisco Bay  
Saw the sun set in the west  
In an non forgetful way  
Sailed the white Pacific Ocean  
While it was in it's darkest blue  
But they still have nothing like you.  
  
I've seen the bright lights of broadway  
In old New York town  
Saw a star light up the night  
As it came tumblin' down  
And the great Niagra Falls  
Well I've seen them too  
Ah, but baby, there's nothin' like you.  
  
I've seen the winter day turn warm  
And the roses start to bud  
Saw the risin' of the moon  
Through a cloud red as blood  
Saw a rainbow of all colors  
When the storm and rain was through.  
Ah, but baby there's nothin' like you.  
  
Yes I've been most everywhere  
Done everthing there is to do  
Ah, but baby, there's nothin' like you
