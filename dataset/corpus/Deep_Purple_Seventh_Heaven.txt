I've been to places where  
The sun goes down  
Each day and never rises  
I've been to places in  
A dark room  
Where we played  
With our disguises  
  
Heaven  
I'm in heaven  
I'm in seventh heaven now  
Seventh heaven  
  
It was a dream I heard a voice  
I put it down to wishful thinking  
It was a dream a silent scream  
Out of the blue a new beginning  
  
Heaven  
I'm in heaven  
I'm in seventh heaven now  
Seventh heaven  
  
And then I fell upon  
A stroke of luck  
That led to my good fortune  
And then I fell upon my knees  
And gently kissed the ground  
You walk on  
  
Heaven  
I'm in heaven  
I'm in seventh heaven now  
Seventh heaven
