I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
The murmur of the morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music  
Mighty fine music  
The singing of the sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right nearby  
  
That's my baby's melody  
When you my angel holding me  
  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song  
  
That's my favorite melody  
When you ma angel holding me  
  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song
