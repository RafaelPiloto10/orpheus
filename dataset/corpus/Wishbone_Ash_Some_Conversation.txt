I'm taking off this hat  
And walking to the sun.  
I'm changing this and that and things  
I'm done with everyone.  
I slip into the sea  
And turn my back on sand  
And diamonds that may be, or not.  
I'll play the final hand.  
To check it all  
And throw it all away,  
But I would always wait for you.  
I'll pass my time in sleep  
With dreams that make me weep  
And all I want's an explanation.  
The little time I need  
The time you won't concede  
And we require some conversation.  
I'm checking off this list  
Of things that stay undone  
And running hard when called upon  
I'm done with everyone.  
I step into the air  
My face against the ground  
Foot prints that may lead or not  
Never let me down.  
To check it all  
And throw it all away  
But I would always wait for you.  
The final demand  
The colour your smile  
All hidden from view  
That burn me  
Freeze me  
Deceive me  
And you.
