You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love can drive a girl insane  
You broke my will oh but what a thrill  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
I like that love cause i thought it was funny  
You came along and you move me honey  
I change my mind this love is sure fine  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good  
Ooh hold me, hold me, i would love to love you  
Like a lover should  
'cause you're fine, and so kind  
I tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine  
I chew my nails and i twiddle my thumbs  
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun  
You broke my will but i love you still and  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
Ooh kiss my baby, ooh it feels good, ooh hold me  
Baby, you ought to love me like a lover should  
'cause you're fine, and so kind  
I tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine  
  
I love that you love cause i thought it was funny  
You came along and you move me honey  
I change my mind, this love is sure fine  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, ooh it feels good  
Ooh hold me, hold me  
You ought to love me like a lover should  
'cause you're fine and so kind
