You've known so long that you were wrong  
But still you had your way  
You told her lies and alibis  
And hurt her more each day  
But now your conscience bothers you  
You've reached your journey's end  
You're asking me for sympathy  
I'm sorry for you, my friend.  
  
You laughed inside each time she cried  
You tried to make her blue  
She tagged along through right and wrong  
Because she worshiped you  
You know that you're the one to blame  
There's no use to pretend  
Today's the day you start to pay  
I'm sorry for you, my friend.  
  
Today as she walked arm in arm  
At someone else's side  
It made you stop and realize  
That time has turned the tide  
You should have known you'd be alone  
'cause cheaters never win  
You tried and lost, now pay the cost  
I'm sorry for you, my friend.
