I'm spinning out.  
I can't control my car  
It doesn't matter,  
If you think you might be, you are.  
I misplace it. I don't know where it's at.  
And I could find it but I'd never get it back.  
Don't get it back [Repeat x2]  
The more you want it,  
The less you're gonna get back.  
I'm running out,  
I don't know when to stop.  
I thought I'd wait until  
I saw the penny drop.  
It started raining,  
Pennies falling in my lap.  
And I could spend it  
But I'd never get it back.  
Don't get it back. [Repeat x2]  
The more you want it  
The less you're gonna get back.  
Don't get it back. [Repeat x2]  
The more you want it  
The less you're gonna get back. [Repeat x3]  
I'm spinning out.  
I can't control my car
