I can't stop, can't stop rockin'  
  
The whole thing started 1963  
Young girls screamin'  
Black and white T.V.  
I was so ready, for something to set me free  
Those four boys from England, singin' right to me  
  
That night I had a dream, of a rock 'n' roll band  
Everyone said no, no, no. I said yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I can't stop, can't stop rockin'  
  
Never really fit in  
Couldn't quite be cool  
Got my ass kicked up and down the halls of my high school  
When things got too crazy  
When life got too cruel  
I would just remember the boys from Liverpool  
  
When I was lost, they were there to hold my hand  
When everyone said no, no, no. They said yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I can't stop, can't stop rockin'
