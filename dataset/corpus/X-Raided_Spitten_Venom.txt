[First Verse]  
If it's on I'll kill my own like a Civil War  
This EBK, what the fuck should I be civil for?  
It's over, pour into my bullet tips  
Split you open like a pinata 'cause you full of shit  
Manana nigga I'ma do you non-believers bad  
With heavy artillery like Sigourney Weaver had  
'cause you an alien or foreigner up in the town  
Either you or I, do or die about to shut you down  
Bout to hunt you down like elk in the woods  
In the hood nothin' else expected  
Accept it, it's what I protected  
No excuse, nothin' else respected  
Known to shoot whenever we tested  
Shit is about to get hectic, Chaos!  
You gone need the sounds to bring you back from where you rested  
May God Bless it  
I'm agnostic so keep that!  
Pure toxic up in your eyes, nigga peep that  
We know where you sleep at  
As we speak my peeps is mashin'  
And we know that you weak ass bunglin' bitches is who we snatchin'  
She catchin' hollow rounds  
Shots to the head make a hollow sound  
Got away with murder, PARANOID! I push this bottle down  
One sip put the bottle down  
And blaze a blunt this one's for you  
Now you rest in peace, no hard feelings bitch I swear it's true  
If it's necessary Black Market do what's called for  
And best believe when it's time for war we all go  
And we all know nothin' comes before this chessboard  
Two knights and kings fightin' screens, yes Lord  
[Chorus]  
I'm spittin' venom like a moccassin  
Grab a glock, CHAMBER, droppin' men  
DANGER, in my RANGER, and I got to win  
DELUSION, no ain't no killin' X-Raided 'cause I refuse to  
[Second Verse]  
Bet all them fools'll know, funk if they want it they got it  
All my proponents is riders committin' murders sporadic  
We quick to get up inside ya blow out your thigh boy  
Psychotic shootin' while yellin' "You got to die Boy!"  
Never should've crossed me, flossy glossy like fresh made varnish  
With a reputation too solid to be penetrated and tarnished  
Harness rage, it's strong, let it loose and you flagrant  
Produce a strap from my draws, introducin' slugs to the vagrants  
Statements was made so foul, niggas is funny style  
Tell a hundred niggas you hate me but when you see me you smile  
But all the while, you thinkin' muthafuck X-Raided  
But in your heart, you never really felt you could fade it  
Debate it, what I represent nigga, this G.B.C.  
Northern Cali freeway from the Sac-Town back down to the M.S.G.'s  
So hit the freeway, no lee-way 'cause this ain't your zip code  
You keep your lip closed  
Or you get those lips swole  
We got your shit exposed, stay the fuck away from us  
We'll light you up and disappear like we vaporous  
My cavaliers, wearin' battle gear, run up in your fort  
Put bullet holes in your shorts  
Left you dead on your porch  
Then we torched your spot, my cohorts got counts calculated  
Shout out you hate it  
That's what you get for doubtin' X-Raided  
Deport your corpse in where the cops'll never bother to look  
Rigormortis decompose you, served ya, bored, and now it's over  
[Chorus] (2x)
