What does friend mean to you?  
A word so wrongfully abused  
Are you like me, confused  
All included but you  
Alone  
The sounds of silence often soothe  
Shapes and colors shift with mood  
Pupils widen and change their hue  
Rapid brown avoid clear blue  
Why's it have to be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Flowers watched through wide brown eyes bloom  
A child sings an unclaimed tune  
Innocence spins cold cocoon  
Grow to see the pain too soon  
Why's it have to be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
"At seven am on a Tuesday, usual August  
Next week I'll be twenty eight  
I'm still young, it'll be me  
Off the wall I scrape you  
I can't wake, I gotta wake  
To cause this wake, I gotta wake no more  
It causes wake, to drown this hate  
To never really stay, never will  
You take your plate  
Put me through hell, live, live  
Direct your fate  
You say I can do it so well  
Your expiration date  
Your expiration date  
Fate, date, expiration date  
(this was the last time)  
Hate  
And don't fuck with me again  
My own clean slate  
Don't fuck with me again  
Makes your eyes dilate  
Makes you shake  
Irate"
