I like to deal with the ladies  
I like to give 'em a real hard time  
Like to make 'em sigh  
Like to make 'em cry over me  
I like to swing with the good times  
I like to have me a real live ball  
Doing what I can like a dirty old man  
  
Like to have 'em just hanging around  
Wondering where I've been  
Like to see 'em with their big brown eyes  
Just a drinking me in  
  
I like to deal with the ladies  
I like to hang em up on my line  
Treat 'em kinda rough  
But they never got enough of me  
Rat a tat tat tat tat
