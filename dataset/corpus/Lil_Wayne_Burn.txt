Uh, hammer on the dresser, work on the stove  
I'm sitting on the counter blowing purp out my nose  
Red bone naked, in the bed flexin'  
I say: "bitch I ain't impressed, you must of got the wrong impression"  
Uh, I ain't with the BS, I'm flyer than PF  
Man, we living in hell like a deep breath  
Real niggas with real money, real bitches with fake asses  
If she don't wanna fuck, I get on my skateboard and I skate pass her  
Money on the table, guns on the table  
Bitch I'm on that syrup, tell that hoe: "let go my ego"  
And my girlfriend is a choppa, I finger fuck that hoe  
Hello I am Tunechi, you had me at "hello"

I put a hole in your apple, what that is? Apple Jacks  
Uh, pussy nigga I'll murder you then dance at your funeral  
Blood I'll have a nigga drinking his own blood, communion  
Wake up like Bone Thugs, I'll call your bluff, pick the phone up  
Her titties fake but they look real, cubic zirconia's  
Run up in your house, spare the kids and kill the grown ups  
Your bitch call me when she hot, Krispy Kreme doughnuts  
Shout out to my new hoes, shout out to my old hoes  
I'll still wear that ass out like a wardrobe  
Bitch, what they gon' say?  
I'm still eating rappers on my fucking lunch break  
Bad yellow bitch with a tongue like a snake  
I let her suck my dick and then I fuck her to some Drake  
  
And then I let that Kush burn, let that Kush burn  
Yeah I let that Kush burn  
Smoking gasoline, bitch  
The booth on fire, I'm in here getting higher  
Young Money, bitch we at the top like barbwire  
  
Uh, money on my mind, I ain't thinking 'bout no bitch  
I'm talking 'bout that scratch like my motherfuckin' throat itch  
Uh, stop stuntin', if you ballin' buy your bitch somethin'  
Stayed on the same team like Tim Duncan  
Shit get real, if you scared go to catholic school  
And if we want it, straight jack it like a padded room  
Shoot your ass 100 times and stand over you  
Lil Tunechi so fly, I got arachnophobia  
Burn bitch, AK in my firm grip  
Leap if you feeling like Kermit, sermons  
Preach, reach and I'll smoke your ass like Cheech  
I be faded like bleach, double barrel, Siamese  
I like my swisher obese, fuck that bitch like police  
Fuck these haters with no grease, you get chin checked, goatee  
Money talks bitch and mine talks like Robin Leach  
That lean got me slow as Lisa Turtle, ask Screech  
Uh, bank card heavy, my wallet like a barbell  
My girl got a fat cat, I call that shit Garfield  
We'll bring the O.K. Corral to your doorbell  
We pull triggers, not coattails, I make lump sums, oatmeal  
I'm stuntin', gettin' new money  
TRUKFIT money, Mountain Dew money, tell 'em  
I get better like fine wine, I'm fire like cayenne  
In the words of my nigga BP, I'll hit a bitch with a car bomb  
BOOM!  
Lil' bitch  
Niggas gon' talk, they ain't talking 'bout shit  
Niggas gon' bark, I go Mike Vick  
Fuck them fuck-niggas on that fuck-shit  
Suck a nigga dick for some TRUKFIT  
  
And then I let that Kush burn, let that Kush burn  
Yeah I let that Kush burn  
Smoking gasoline, bitch

Holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer
