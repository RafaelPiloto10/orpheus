in the beginning  
there was no light  
no teenage heaven or hell  
no songs or voices came  
from across the outlands  
where oceans were ment to be, where oceans were ment to be  
oh my god, i feel so alone  
some million light years far from home  
how about you who are living in the 20th century  
carol  
you better stop to get the tickets  
for the starlite show  
everybody wants to be there  
what a dream  
so if you don't mind,  
will you join me  
on my way through the eye  
up to the light  
into the world
