Isn't it nasty, isn't it sad  
Gonna make you wonder  
Gonna make you mad  
Same ol' heartache your best friend  
Has come to visit once again  
Your mistake was in the beginning  
When you thought that he would last  
When you weren't looking  
No you weren't listen  
And once he left you broke like glass  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Thought you had yourself a true love  
Thought he was in love with you  
But he was just like a devil  
Took your heart and broke it to  
Well there's no telling who's on the level  
And there's no way to know what's real  
Just remember how it all happened  
And be sure that you know who's got the deal  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart  
Love is gonna slip right through you  
You got to watch it from the start
