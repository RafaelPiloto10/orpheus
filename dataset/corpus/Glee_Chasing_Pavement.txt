I've made up my mind,  
Don't need to think it over,  
If I'm wrong I am right,  
Don't need to look no further,  
This ain't lust,  
I know this is love but,  
  
If I tell the world,  
I'll never say enough,  
Cause it was not said to you,  
And that's exactly what I need to do,  
If I'm in love with you,  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
I'd build myself up,  
  
And fly around in circles,  
Wait then as my heart drops,  
And my back begins to tingle  
Finally could this be it  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere
