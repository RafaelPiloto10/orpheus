Here it comes another lonely day.  
Playing the game, I'll sail away  
On a voyage of no return to see  
If eternal life is meant to be,  
And if I find the key, to the eternal dream.  
The painted ladies of the Avalon.  
Play in the sun, take to the road  
To the north there lies the chills of cold,  
To the south there lies, the tales  
untold,  
But in between their lies, the place  
to close your eyes.  
  
And I will stay, I'll not be back,  
Eldorado,  
I will be free, of the world  
Eldorado  
  
Say goodbye the city's heroes sing  
Bird on the wind,  
Feel, feel so free  
Through the life upon the rooftop  
haze,  
All the cheating and the broken days,  
So through it all I see,  
There's nothing left for me.  
  
And I will stay, I'll not be back,  
Eldorado,  
I will be free, of the world  
Eldorado  
  
Sitting here on top of everywhere,  
What do I care,  
Days never end.  
I know the voyage's end will soon  
be here,  
No eternal life is here for me,  
And now I found the key,  
To the eternal dream.  
  
Then I will stay, I'll not be back,  
Eldorado.  
I will be free, of the world,  
Eldorado
