(Ah, pretty girl - ah, pretty girl)  
Just you and me, pretty girl  
No one's gonna see, pretty girl  
Well I feel so good when you hold me tight  
So let's make love till the broad daylight  
'Cause I love you, mmm, pretty girl  
Don't you be so tame, pretty girl  
You drive me insane, pretty girl  
Everytime your lips meet mine  
A funny chill runs up my spine  
'Cause I love you, mmm, pretty girl  
Come on let me hold you, let me squeeze you tight  
Let my arms unfold you, you're mine tonight  
Just you and me, pretty girl  
No one's gonna see, pretty girl  
Well I feel so good when you hold me tight  
So let's make love till the broad daylight  
'Cause I love you, men, pretty girl
