I love you more than life  
I'd give you all I have  
You know, I need you next to me  
  
Like the touch of a star  
You came to my life  
Giving me happiness  
With the warmth of the sun  
You blessed me inside  
Giving me radiance  
  
Bridge  
Ooh you know it's true (you know it's true)  
My miracle is you  
  
Chorus  
I love you more than life  
I'd give you all I have  
You know, I need you next to me  
You always give me love  
You sent from up above  
You know, I need you next to me  
  
Like a rainbow of light  
You've opened my dreams  
Filling my emptiness  
When I'm deep in your arms  
I feel what love means  
Just with a simple kiss  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby  
You give me more than anybody can conceive  
So pure and special  
Your love is the key  
I will be sure to have you always next to me  
You've given me the reason- the reason to live  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
I love to see you smile  
I loved you all the while  
You know I need you next to me  
Yeah,  
  
Spoken: I need you next to me.
