Missy I miss you so. oh little sister  
I wish you'd come back to me and sit by my side  
We'd laugh and we'd play again, if only you'll try  
You know "they" would show the way  
From the other side  
Rise from your grave little sister  
  
Rise rise rise my friends rise  
Spirits rising from their grave  
Burning shadows in the dead of night  
Icy fingers all over my hand  
Try to make me understand  
"finally we have returned all of us"  
  
Missy is that you, come closer  
Spirits rising from their grave  
Everywhere that ghostly stare  
Icy fingers all over my hand  
Lead me back to where she stands  
"they" are back to share my life "they" are back  
  
Missy come, come with me, there are things I must know  
How did you get here, where's the door to the other side  
Missy: "beyond the graves lies the gate  
The gate that leads to the dead  
We have to leave before the dawn  
If not by the sun we will burn"  
  
Spirits rising from their grave  
Soon the dawn will chase the dark away  
Icy fingers all over my hand  
Lead me back to where "they" stand  
Am I glad you have returned all of you  
  
Do you remember when grandmother said she heard "them" sing  
I've heard "them" too and I really wish I could hear "them" again  
Missy: "in your mind you'll hear "them" sing  
Every night at the graves  
We have to leave before the dawn  
If not by the sun we will burn  
Now sing"  
  
Show your powers onto me
