you read the papers today?  
  
I read the news today oh boy,  
About a tragic comedy  
Newspaper hinted suicide,  
The letterhead read dear johnny  
A tainted truth was all it said,  
Sleep tight now that  
You've made your bed  
An arrow that once pierced your heart  
Points to the apple on your head  
  
Three sides to every story  
Yours, mine  
And, Monday morning's  
  
Cupid's dead, headlines read,  
Cupid's dead  
Cupid's dead, headlines read,  
Cupid's dead  
  
Oh, romeo, oh, romeo  
Where did our love go, romeo?  
If you read between the headlines,  
You wouldn't be the last to know  
No mystery yet to unfold,  
A paperboy left in the cold  
A love was said to never die,  
Withered away and just got old  
  
'our top story tonight,  
Is a crime of passion  
The victim, an unidentified man,  
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper,  
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand,  
And clutching a letter in the other.  
The letter simply read  
Cupid's dead.'  
  
Extra, extra, extra,  
Read all about it  
  
Cupid's dead,  
  
Cupid is dead, deceased,  
I got peace of mind  
Still it's hard to forget,  
What it leaves behind  
A lot of love lost,  
Your feelings are wasted,  
Tasted the sweetness,  
But now you're faced with,  
The thought, of being alone  
Nor more companionship,  
You can handle it,  
Just abandon it,  
Leave it behind,  
And look for the brighter day  
Give it some time,  
Cause it won't come right away  
You gotta be standing strong,  
Hold on to your dignity  
Don't sit around,  
Saying look what ya did to me  
It's time to move on,  
You gotta continue  
To look for a love,  
Of a life that's within you  
Cupid is dead now,  
It's time to rely on,  
Yourself to cope  
You got no shoulder to cry on  
Dead
