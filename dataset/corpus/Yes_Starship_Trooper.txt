Sister Bluebird flying high above,  
Shine your wings forward to the sun.  
Hide the myst'ries of life on your way.  
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word.  
What you don't know, I have never heard.  
  
Starship Trooper, go sailing on by,  
Catch my soul, catch the very night.  
Hide the moment from my eager eyes.  
Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul.  
What you can't see, can't be very whole.  
  
Speak to me of summer, long winters longer than time can remember,  
Setting up of other roads, travel on in old accustomed ways.  
I still remember the talks by the water, the proud sons and daughters that,  
In the knowledge of the land, spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways.  
  
Mother life, hold firmly on to me.  
Catch my knowledge higher than the day.  
Lose as much as only you can show.  
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word.  
What I don't know, I have never shared.  
  
Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever.  
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the fact there shown before you.  
Take what I say in a diff'rent way and it's easy to see that this is all
confusion.  
As I see a new day in me, I can also show if you and you may follow.  
  
Speak to me of summer, long winters longer than time can remember,  
Setting up of other roads, travel on in old accustomed ways.  
I still remember the talks by the water, the proud sons and daughters that,  
In the knowledge of the land, spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways.
