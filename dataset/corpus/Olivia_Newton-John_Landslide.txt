Cold winds rarely blow  
Here at the end of the rainbow  
Guess it's hard to believe  
I'd be willing to leave  
Someone walked up behind me  
Seemed to find me  
I felt him standing there, I turned around and  
Saw the face of an angel, I fell  
It wasn't fair, it just wasn't fair  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs  
My needs won't be denied  
It was a landslide  
Somehow I'm thrilled by all he says  
High on his campaign promises  
I don't wanna come down  
I don't wanna come down  
But no promises he made me could persuade me  
Like the loneliness that comes on when I  
Try to go on without him  
Try to doubt him  
I confess, I have to confess  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs  
My needs won't be denied  
It was a landslide  
I'm in heaven when he's around  
In heaven when he's around  
And I'm hoping that he might be  
Feeling the same as me  
I'm in heaven, heaven  
It isn't hard to see  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs  
My needs won't be denied  
It was a landslide  
I'm gonna tell everybody I see  
He's the only party for me  
It really was a, it really was a  
You know it was a landslide  
It really was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs-acapo
