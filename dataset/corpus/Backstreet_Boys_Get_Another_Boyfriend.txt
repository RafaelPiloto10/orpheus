Backstreet  
Check it uh  
Hey  
  
Let's talk about one, baby  
You gotta hear me out  
Did you really think I'd be the last to know  
What it's all about  
  
Let's talk about you  
You say  
He's the essence of your life  
But he'll eat you up from inside slow  
And then he doesn't want to know  
  
I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside  
And then he doesn't want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen I mean it  
There's nothin' that he's worthy of  
He's just another player  
Playing in the name of love  
I've seen enough  
Now this must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)  
To become your number one  
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses  
That turn you on  
I've seen it before (dont take!)  
Anymore, free too  
You're through for sure  
Just go get on with your life  
Stop acting like you've given up  
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life  
Stop acting like you've given up  
  
Listen I mean it (I mean it)  
There's nothin' that he's worthy of  
He's just another player (player)  
Playing in the name of love  
I've seen enough  
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)  
Get another boyfriend  
  
All right  
Yeah  
Get another boyfriend  
Stop  
Hey  
  
Hear me out  
You must know (you must know)  
What it's all about (baby)  
That he's just a player in love (love)  
This must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
[Chorus: x2]
