You don't know how you met me  
You don't know why,  
You can't turn around  
And say goodbye,  
  
All you know is when I'm with you  
I make you free  
And swim through your veins  
Like a fish in the sea,  
  
I'm singin'  
Follow me  
Everything is all right,  
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night,  
And if you want to leave I can guarantee  
You won't find nobody else like me,  
  
I'm not worried  
'bout the ring you wear  
'cause as long as no one knows  
Then nobody can care,  
  
You're feelin' guilty  
And I'm well aware  
But you don't look ashamed  
And baby I'm not scared,  
  
I'm singin'  
Follow me  
Everything is all right,  
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night,  
And if you want to leave I can guarantee  
You won't find nobody else like me,  
  
Won't give you money  
I can't give you the sky  
Your better off if you don't ask why,  
  
I'm not the reason that you  
Go astray  
We'll be alright  
If you don't ask me to stay,  
  
Follow me  
Everything is all right,  
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night,  
And if you want to leave I can guarantee  
You won't find nobody else like me,  
  
You don't know how you met me  
You don't know why  
You can't turn around and  
Say goodbye,  
  
All you know is when I'm with you  
I make you free  
And swim through your veins  
Like a fish in the sea,  
  
I'm singin'  
Follow me  
Everything is all right,  
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night,  
And if you want to leave I can guarantee  
You won't find nobody else like me,  
  
I'm singin'  
Follow me  
Everything is all right,  
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night,  
And if you want to leave I can guarantee  
You won't find nobody else like me,  
  
I'm singin'  
Follow me  
Everything is all right,  
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night,  
And if you want to leave I can guarantee  
You won't find nobody else like me
