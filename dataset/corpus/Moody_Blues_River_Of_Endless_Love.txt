I'm looking for a better world  
Where there's no more hurt,  
Where there's only hope  
For the eagle and the dove.  
I can see your face,  
Nothing can take your place  
If we sail away on a river of endless love.  
I'm living in the hands of time,  
On the wings of love,  
On the edge of night,  
Where there's darkness everywhere.  
I won't be denied,  
I'm never going to leave your side,  
I will always be  
On the river of endless love  
  
In the silence just before the dawn  
The shadows lose their form.  
We rise to greet the morning.  
In the calm that comes before the storm  
A troubled and a restless heart is born.  
The river of endless love  
  
I'm tearing down the walls of hate,  
Gonna start again, gonna turn it round,  
Gonna build it with a prayer.  
I can always dream  
And nothing is what it seems.  
If you lose your way  
You can always find us there.  
  
In the silence just before the dawn  
The shadows lose their form  
We rise to greet the morning  
In the calm that comes before the storm  
A troubled and a restless heart is born  
The river of endless love
