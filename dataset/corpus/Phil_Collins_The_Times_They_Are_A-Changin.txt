Come gather 'round people wherever you roam,  
And admit that the waters around you have grown,  
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin'  
Then you better start swimmin'  
Or you'll sink like a stone  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come writers and critics who prophecize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide,  
The chance won't come again,  
And don't speak too soon  
For the wheel's still in spin  
And there's no tellin' who  
That it's namin'  
For the loser now  
Will be later to win  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come senators, congressmen,  
Please heed the call  
Don't stand in the doorway,  
Don't block the hall,  
For he that' gets hurt  
Will be he who has stalled,  
There's a battle  
Outside and it's ragin'  
It'll soon shake your windows  
And rattle your walls  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come mothers and fathers  
Throughout the land,  
And don't criticize  
What you can't understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command,  
Your old road is rapidly agin',  
Please get out of the new one  
If you can't lend your hand  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
The line it is drawn,  
The curse it is cast,  
The slow one now will  
Later be fast,  
As the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin'  
And the first one now  
Will later be last  
For the times they are a-changin'
