This is a radio message to my baby,  
And I'm  
Come back, come back,  
Come back, come back.  
  
I'm sorry that I made you cry,  
I'm sorry for, for the rest of my life,  
And I'm sorry that I hurt you,  
And I'm sorry for lying to you,  
  
And I'm lost without you,  
Cause I'm, about you,  
'Cause you're here to stay, on me  
I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend  
Can you forgive me, can you forgive me  
I don't want no more tickets  
No  
  
[Chorus]  
This is a radio message to my baby,  
And I'm, come back,  
Come back, come back, come back.  
This is a radio message to my baby,  
And I'm back and,  
Come back, come back, come back,  
Come back, come back.  
  
And I'm sorry for treating you that way,  
I'm sorry for all the,  
Sorry I didn't to what I promised,  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry that we ever met.  
  
I'm lost without you,  
Cause I'm all about you,  
To stay, on me,  
I'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend,  
Can you forgive me, can you forgive me,  
I don't want no more tickets,  
No  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Somebody love this record,  
Cause I want you,  
To my baby, come back, 'cause I want you,  
Cause I need, I need right back to me,  
So, I want you,  
Whatever you take the pain  
I'm the next caller on the radio,  
This is a radio message to my baby.  
  
I need you, I need you, I need you to come back home, ohhhh, please
