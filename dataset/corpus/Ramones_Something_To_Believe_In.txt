I wish I was someone else  
I'm confused, I'm afraid, I hate the loneliness  
And there's nowhere to run to  
Nothing makes any sense, but I still try my hardest  
  
Take my hand  
Please help me man  
Cause I'm looking for something to believe in  
And I don't know where to start  
And I don't know where to begin, to begin  
  
If I was stupid or naive  
Trying to achieve what they all call contentedness  
If people weren't such dicks and I never made mistakes  
Then I could find forgiveness  
  
Take my hand  
Please help me man  
Cause I'm looking for something to believe in  
And I don't know where to start  
And I don't know where to begin, oh no  
  
I can't be someone else  
I don't feel that it's hopeless  
I don't feel that I'm useless  
  
I can't throw it all away  
I need some courage to find my weakness  
And with your love, I know with all my heart I can win  
  
Cause I'm looking for something to believe in  
And I just need something to believe in  
I'm looking for something to believe in  
And I just need something to believe in
