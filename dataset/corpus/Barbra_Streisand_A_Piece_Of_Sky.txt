Tell me where  
Where is it written  
What is it I was meant to be?  
That I can't dare  
It all began the day I found  
That from my window I could only see  
A piece of sky  
I stepped outside and looked around  
I never dreamed it was so wide  
Or even half as high  
The time had come  
(Papa, can you hear me?)  
To try my wings  
(Papa, are you near me?)  
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall  
I felt the most  
(Papa, can you see me?)  
Amazing things  
(Can you understand me?)  
The things you can't imagine  
If you've never flown at all  
Though it's safer to stay on the ground  
Sometimes where danger lies  
There the sweetest of pleasures are found  
No matter where I go  
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve  
But there will also be  
More to question, yet more to believe  
Oh tell me where?  
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?  
And want to share  
My every sweet-imagined possibility?  
The more I live - the more I learn  
The more I learn - the more I realize  
The less I know  
Each step I take  
(Papa, I've a voice now!)  
Each page I turn  
(Papa, I've a choice now!)  
Each mile I travel only means  
The more I have to go  
What's wrong with wanting more?  
If you can fly - then soar!  
With all there is - why settle for  
Just a piece of sky?  
Papa, I can hear you  
Papa, I can see you  
Papa, I can feel you  
Papa, watch me fly!
