Called her name but the wind blew strong,  
I called in vain though I tried so long,  
Called the sea to bring her home,  
But the sea don't hear and I'm still alone  
I feel an emptiness inside  
Something within me I can't hide  
  
Standing here looking at the sky,  
But the light I see can't tell me why,  
I feel an emptiness inside,  
Something within me I can't hide.  
  
Every time I stop to think  
That's the time I get lonely  
That's the time it hurts the most  
Every time I get lonely.  
  
What went wrong, who am I to blame,  
Did I take too long, to call her name,  
  
I feel an emptiness inside  
Something within me I can't hide.
