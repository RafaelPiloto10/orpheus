There's a shadow hanging over the valley  
A total eclipse of the moon  
Closing up the gates of the city  
The wind it plays a wild tune  
Don't you put a lock on your window  
Don't you put the bar on your door  
Don't you cry for the rain in the sky  
You've seen the storm before  
  
Yea now what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
  
Now lightnings going to strike at midnight  
Thunder going to shake the ground  
Don't you flinch don't give a inch  
Just a let the flood come down  
  
Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wildman yell
