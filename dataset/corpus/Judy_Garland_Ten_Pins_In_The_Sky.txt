Did you ever wonder why in thunder  
Thunder comes in spring?  
Once upon a time it seems  
All the world was wrapped in dreams  
Playful little fellas, so they tell us  
Said Let's have our fling!  
Spring is in the air, you know!  
It's time to wake 'em up below!  
So, when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry  
They're playing ten-pins in the sky  
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly  
While rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky  
The world will wear a new bonnet  
Daffodils on it  
Thanks to the skies above  
Thunder and showers  
Wake up the flowers  
Where there are flowers  
There must be love  
So, laugh at raindrops, laugh at thunder  
Clouds will soon roll by  
They're playing ten-pins in the sky!
