Written by Eric Andersen  
  
You said loving you  
And leaving you  
Was the hardest thing to do  
To give my foot  
Another chance  
To try another shoe  
But every time I see someone  
I'm always seeing you  
No I have not always been faithful  
I always have been true  
  
Did you ever walk the empty street  
Until the break of dawn  
Just to hear some lonesome sparrow  
Sing a lonesome song  
Did it make you feel any better  
Like a stranger left so low  
Though you didn't know you both had been  
A thousand miles from home  
  
And you said loving you  
And leaving you  
Was the hardest thing to do  
To give my foot  
Another chance  
To try another shoe  
But every time I see someone  
I'm always seeing you  
No I have not always been faithful  
I always have been true  
No I have not always been faithful  
I always have been true
