Margery's dreaming of the middle of the day  
Tiyuri to win  
Perfect Dozen to place  
money is the matter that's been on her mind  
time ticks by her one race at a time  
  
She's tryin' to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of horses  
  
Lookin' at a green sky  
Sun like a red eye  
Bright blue horses are the fortune she lives by  
She's tired and lonely  
Scared and depressed  
Her visions of one day go racing the next  
  
She's trying to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of horses  
  
Margie doesn't say anything all the way home  
So afraid she'll awake to find she's all alone  
  
Margery's wingspan's all feathers and coke cans, and  
TV dinners and letters she won't send, and  
Every race night is shot through with sunlight  
Trying to hit the big one one last time tonight for...  
  
Drunken fathers and stupid mothers and  
Boys who can't tell one girl from another  
So she takes her pills  
Careful and round  
One of these days she's gonna throw the whole bottle down  
  
But she's trying to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of...  
  
Trying to be a good girl  
And give 'em what they want  
But Margery's dreaming of horses
