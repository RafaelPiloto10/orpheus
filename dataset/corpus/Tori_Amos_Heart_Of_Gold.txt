I want to live, I want to to give  
I want to to live, I want to to give  
I've been a miner, for a heart of gold  
It's these expressions, I'll never give,  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to redwood  
I crossed an ocean, for a heart of gold  
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line  
That keeps me searching, yea, yea,  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold, of gold, I said,  
  
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to redwood,  
I crossed an ocean for a heart of gold.

That keeps me searching for a heart of gold, yea,  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold, yea,  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
  
And, and I'm getting old, I said, a-I am getting old
