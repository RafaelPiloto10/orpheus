Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean  
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything  
Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way  
Where lived the Cajun lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen  
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine  
  
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks  
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine  
  
Mississippi queen, if you know what I mean  
Mississippi queen, she taught me everything  
This lady she asked me, if I would be her man  
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can  
To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine  
  
While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends  
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losin' mine  
  
I was losin' my mind, on the Mississippi Queen

To keep a Mississippi queen
