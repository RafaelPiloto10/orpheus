In the land of the broken hearted  
People lookin' for the horseshoe man  
They've been picking up little pieces  
They've been puttin' 'em all in his hand  
  
And the way the story started  
Two lovers long ago  
Took a vow to live with heart break  
Took a chance but how could they know love?  
  
How could they know love?  
Love, how could they know love  
  
Horseshoe man's been working his magic  
Fixin' heart break everywhere  
He's the one we all can count on  
When we're lost and don't know where love is  
  
He takes the pieces in his hand  
And shakes 'em up like he doesn't care  
He says there will always be heart break  
Because love is everywhere  
  
Love, I don't know about love  
Love, I don't know  
  
Love don't care if you're wrong or right  
Love don't know if you're black or white  
Love ain't lookin' for perfection  
Love's the answer  
Love's the question  
  
Love, I don't know about love  
Love, I don't know  
Love, I don't know about love  
Love, I don't know about love
