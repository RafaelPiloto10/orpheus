[Verse:]  
Mary steers clear of the men from space  
Back alley kid with an American face  
She wants the wine, he brings a case  
To carry them on through  
I said you know what I know about the bedroom boys  
And the undercover russians in a pink Rolls Royce  
They bang the drum, she sets the beat  
They carry Miss America outta the street  
She sings snowman, scarecrow, John Doe, buffalo  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am a scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop, dup dup, doo roo roop do  
Oh, I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Snowman, sideshow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I fell out of love in the snowbound days  
Riding the subway in a Valium haze  
I need the whites, she gets the blues it carries us on through  
All these American boys at the park and shop  
Selling their memories for a dollar a pop  
Ivan the ancient spaceman race fan  
Corners the market on American taste  
And says spaceman, scarecrow, peepshow, freak show  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am the scarecrow  
Dup dup, doo roo roop, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Punk rock video dup dup, doo roo roop  
  
[Verse 3:]  
All the sudden light inside you dies, maybe you're going on alone  
Maybe you go it all alone, she dreams of sunlight  
Sings of smaller things  
White sugar bowls and wedding rings and you go on from me alone  
You're going on, you're on your own  
She was married alive in a Moscow surgery  
Hoping to die in a Cold War nursery  
All of the kids back home believin' much more than we do  
It's a memory play where the memory fades  
And the pictures you took into records we played  
Spy versus spy, scarecrow and I  
Out across the darkness where the bomberjets fly, singing  
Spaceman, smoke show, scarecrow, geronimo  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am the scarecrow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Snowman, freak show, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Come on, come on, come on!  
Oh, I wish you wouldn't go, I got the arms to reach you  
I am the scarecrow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh, scarecrow, dup dup, doo roo roop  
Oh, I guess you ought to know, I got the hands to teach you  
I am the scarecrow dup dup, doo roo roop  
Listen on the midnight radio dup dup, doo roo roop
