Your arms around me  
How can I complain  
With your arms around me  
Uhm, I know I'm a lucky man  
  
With your arms around me  
Honey, I'm taller than a tree  
So all I can say is  
Keep those arms around me  
  
When I woke up this morning  
Oh, I had an aching head  
The pain was so great  
Uhm, I almost fell out of bed  
  
Then you put your arms around me  
Then you kiss me three times  
And in a matter of seconds  
I never felt so fine, oh no, oh yes I did  
  
With your arms around me  
I can feel no no no no pain  
With your arms around me  
Uhm, I know I'm the worlds strongest man  
  
With your arms around me, yeah  
If I was blind I know that I could see, oh now  
All I can say is  
Keep those loving arms around me  
Oh now, oh now, oh now
