Ugh  
Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide?  
Always screwing with my mind, a thorn in my spine  
Oh Sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time  
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine  
Wait!  
See it before my eyes  
Why!  
Go out that way  
  
Looking all the time, at your face so blind  
Feeling uptight, always the same fight  
Hey man, now decide, go ahead take your time  
Kissing all the time, that thorn in my spine  
Wait!  
You cannot see my side  
Why!  
Play yourself out that way  
Why!  
You and me always hate  
Wait!  
Weren't you my friend?  
  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
  
Hey man, look inside, know you'll need your own life  
Remember me, guy? That thorn in your spine  
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine  
Remember me, guy? The thorn in your spine  
Wait!  
You can't even see my side  
Why!  
Play yourself out that way  
Why!  
You and me always hate  
Wait!  
Weren't you my friend?  
Wait! You were my friend  
Wait! You were my friend  
Wait! You were my friend  
Wait! You were my friend
