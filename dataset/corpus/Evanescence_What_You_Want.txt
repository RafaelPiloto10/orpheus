Do what you, what you want  
If you have a dream for better  
Do what you what you want  
Till you don't want it anymore (Remember who you really are)  
  
Do what you, what you want  
Your world's closing in on you now (It isn't over)  
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)  
Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to believe we can break through  
  
Do what you, what you want  
You don't have to lay your life down (Is it over?)  
Do what you what you want  
Till you find what you're looking for (Got to remember who you really are)  
  
But every hour slipping by screams that I have failed you  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe  
  
There's still time, close your eyes  
Only love will guide you home  
Tear down the walls and free your soul  
Till we crash we're forever spiraling down, down, down, down  
  
Hello, hello, it's only me  
Infecting everything you love  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to believe  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to learn forgiveness  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to believe we can break through  
  
Remember who you really are  
Do what you want, you want
