So you take your chances  
Look through dirty lenses  
Unintended consequences  
We don't need your ugly fences  
We'll make our own way out of here  
  
Start a car  
Get away  
There's so much you could see today  
  
If we don't escape  
We'll turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me, do  
We even have a chance?  
  
If we don't escape  
The things we do  
Won't make a difference  
It's just me and you  
And all our best laid plans  
  
So we've run right off the map  
Get away from all the traps  
Inevitable consequences  
Living only present tenses  
Only living for the now  
  
Start a car  
Get away  
There's so much you could see today  
  
If we don't escape  
We'll turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me, do  
We even have a chance?  
  
If we don't escape  
The things we do  
Won't make a difference  
It's just me and you  
And all our best laid plans  
  
If we don't escape  
We'll turn into  
Everything we hate  
But tell me, do  
We even have a chance?  
  
If we don't escape  
The things we do  
Won't make a difference  
It's just me and you  
And all our best laid plans
