(Hey, hey) She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door  
You grow up quick when ya grow up poor  
It's the only way to LA that she knows  
The Hollywood pose, teeth, tits, and toes  
Didn't take her long to leave the boulevard  
So many five star friends with black credit cards  
She'd try anything once, 'cause anything goes  
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap  
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week  
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
  
(Hey, hey) I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book  
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look  
Every A list player is a favorite friend  
Says they all taste the same in the back of the Benz  
Her congressman will call her every once in a while  
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile  
She's done everyone once, and everyone knows  
You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press  
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best  
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest  
Ya he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands.
