Cascaded darkness  
Walls close in on me.  
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.  
Severe anguish as my body evolves.  
The pain of life after death it resolves.  
  
Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,  
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.  
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.  
Merely secret in my dreams.  
  
Night grows cold, twilight's near,  
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.  
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass  
No spared breath.  
  
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.  
Dead soul,  
Stone cold,  
Out into the night.  
  
Voices inside my head  
Hold me under.  
Voices oppress.  
Like roaring thunder.  
  
An echo bouncing inside my brain.  
How much can I take of the pain,  
The pain!  
  
A war raging deep inside my head,  
A split decision that will end with me dead.  
  
You see the agony in my eyes,  
Protruding aimless,  
I think it's time to die.  
  
A cannibal's desire feeds the fire  
That burns in your head.  
  
Intense pain eats away at your brain,  
Thorazine pumping through your veins.  
  
Death walks inside you,  
Smell death around you,  
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,  
Hear the sound of the bell  
Counting off death tolls.  
  
Laughing as you eternally rot,  
Searching for human flesh  
And life's blood.  
  
Live Undead.
