Take a step outside yourself  
And turn around  
Take a look at who you are  
It's pretty scary  
So silly  
Revolting  
You're not much  
You can't do anything  
Take a step outside the city  
And turn around  
Take a look at what you are  
It is revolting  
You're really nowhere  
So wasteful  
So foolish  
Poppycock  
Who said don't look back?  
Don't believe 'em  
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant  
Cause they're gonna try and get behind you  
Don't you let them do it  
You know what I'm talking about?  
You hear me talking?  
You hear me talking?  
It's pretty scary it's so revolting  
Take a step outside the country  
And turn around  
Take a look at what you are  
It is amazing  
Take a good look  
You're no big deal  
You're so petty  
It's lots  
Take a step outside the planet  
Turn around and around  
Take a look at where you are  
It's pretty scary
