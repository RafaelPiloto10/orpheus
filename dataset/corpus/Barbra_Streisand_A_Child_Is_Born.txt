A child is born  
We've suddenly stepped through  
A thousand dolls  
A child is born  
Her chin is like mine  
But her eyes are yours  
How perfectly formed are her fingers  
So far reach, so much to know  
What words will be formed by her fingers  
We'll hold her close  
Then let her go  
How sweet to find  
A part of ourselves  
We knew nothing of  
A child is born  
A child that is born of our love
