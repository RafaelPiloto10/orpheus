We were still in high school  
When I first met you  
Even then you were the prettiest girl  
That I ever knew  
And we carved our name on  
Everything that we could find  
The way that all kids do  
And although time has passed  
I still get surprised  
At the pulling in my chest  
When I know you're coming by  
If this feeling's proving anything  
It's not everything  
Is gonna change with time  
You're still mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you know when you're around  
My heart won't it can't slow down  
It beats so hard it makes it hard  
To catch my breath, to catch my breath  
  
Don't ever ask me if I'm sorry  
Or that I'm here with you  
Baby you can bet  
I don't regret the girls I never knew  
Every day's another first  
Another change for me  
To fall in love with you  
And I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh... When you're with me  
I stop seeing  
Any way to fail how do I explain  
I try to tell you what I'm feeling  
But how do I when all words pale  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
To catch my breath, to catch my breath  
To catch my breath, to catch my breath
