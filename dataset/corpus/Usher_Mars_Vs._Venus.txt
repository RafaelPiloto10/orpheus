(initiate radar)  
  
Your eyes say it all (all)  
All  
They're fixed upon an object of desire  
You can't control (control)  
No (No)  
But gravity compels you to ignite (ignite)  
And explode (explode)  
Oh  
Til our time and space combine you'll fantasize (size)  
The unknown  
Ooh  
  
Girl it's taking off the ground  
You know how I put it down  
Have you seeing stars baby  
  
This is the big bang so unpredictable  
Sex, love  
And find out whose in control  
Mars verses Venus  
But when the worlds collide  
This is the big bang  
Step into the ring of fire  
Sex, love  
Lets find out who can tame desire  
  
Seduce and analyze  
Yeah  
Objective is to conquer deep  
And I, make paradise  
  
Girl it's taking off the ground  
You know how I put it down  
Have you seeing stars ooh  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
This is the big bang so unpredictable  
Sex, love  
And find out whose in control  
Mars verses Venus  
But when the worlds collide  
This is the big bang  
Step into the ring of fire  
Sex, love  
Lets find out who can tame desire  
  
Pitch black  
Across amidst the galaxy between the sheets  
Want that only you and I  
Generate when we collide  
Hold that  
Don't make my emotions peak  
If I let go then I'll be weak  
Your control is my defeat  
I repeat never never never never  
Will I give up no no no no  
(I ain't givin' up no)  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
This is the big bang so unpredictable  
Sex, love  
And find out whose in control  
Mars verses Venus  
But when the worlds collide  
This is the big bang  
Step into the ring of fire  
Sex, love  
Lets find out who can tame desire  
Mars verses Venus  
  
But when the worlds collide  
  
I don't know if I win  
But I know that I wanna do it again  
  
I don't know if I win  
But I know that I wanna do it again  
  
I don't know if I win  
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah  
  
I don't know if I'll ever win  
Mars verses Venus
