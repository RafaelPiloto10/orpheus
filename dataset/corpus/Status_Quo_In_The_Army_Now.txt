A vacation in the foreign land  
Uncle Sam does the best he can  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Now you remember what the draft man said  
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you're in the army, now  
  
You'll be a hero of the neighborhood  
Nobody knows that you left for good  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Smiling faces on the way to 'Nam  
But once you get there no one gives a damn  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Hand grenades flying over your head  
  
Missiles flying over your head  
If you want to survive, get out of bed  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh, you're in the army, now  
  
Shots ring out in the dead of night  
The sergeant calls: "Stand up and fight!"  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you're in the army, now  
  
You've got your orders to shoot on sight  
Your finger's on the trigger but it don't seem right  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you're in the army, now  
  
Night is falling and you just can't see  
Is this illusion or reality  
You're in the army now  
Oh, oh you
