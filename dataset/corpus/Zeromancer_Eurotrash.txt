We are nothing but Eurotrash  
We take Plastic we take Cash  
We sell our hearts second class  
We slit our throats on tinted glass  
  
We are selling an image  
Everything must go  
I want you to know  
You don't want the side FX  
You want to .com  
New simulated sex  
We're selling you heaven  
Prices down to a low  
I thought you should know  
It's all in your head  
You're living a lie  
There is nothing  
Money can't buy  
  
We are nothing but Eurotrash  
We take Plastic we take Cash  
We sell our hearts second class  
We slit our throats on tinted glass  
  
We're silicon stitches  
Reality bites hard  
I want you to know  
It's all in your head  
You're living a lie  
There is nothing Money can't buy  
The future is here  
Dreams have no end  
Everything must go
