Finger food and an ice cold keg  
It won't cost you an arm and a leg  
Dance all night to a rotten band  
Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand  
  
Saturday night, it's the place to be  
Everybody cut footloose with me  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
Hey  
  
Met a little lady so pretty and young  
She was quite a little talker 'till the cat got her tongue  
She oozed up beside me, I turned on my charm  
Well, pretty soon she was completely disarmed  
  
I said, "Girl, now don't fall to pieces on me"  
But she cried her eyes out - literally  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
Hey, hey  
  
Hey now, buddy, don't you give me no lip  
Sorry I was using your head for dip  
There's a guy in the hot tub, I don't know who  
Wait a minute, it looks like Stu  
  
Well, hold the phone now, what do I see?  
Another pretty mama got her eye on me  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
  
There's a party at the leper colony  
(Party at the leper colony)  
There's a party at the leper colony  
(Party at the leper colony)  
  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
Yeah, party at the leper colony  
Well, there's a party at the leper colony  
(Party at the leper colony)  
Hey
