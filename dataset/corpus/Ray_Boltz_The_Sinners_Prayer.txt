Lord, You've touched my heart today  
That is why I've come to pray  
You see all I have inside  
All the things I try to hide  
Jesus, I believe that You are there  
And You're listening to this sinner's prayer  
Touch this broken heart and make it new  
I believe in You  
Please forgive me for my sin  
All I've done and all I've been  
Serving You forevermore  
Everyday You'll be my Lord  
Jesus, I believe that You are there  
And You're listening to this sinner's prayer  
Knowing You'll remember what You've heard  
I believe Your word  
In Your name this prayer will end  
And a new life will begin  
Now I know, I'm not alone  
Hold my hand and lead me home
