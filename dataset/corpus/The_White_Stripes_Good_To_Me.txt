I've got a 1980 Volvo  
I get it started up and I go  
It's not a vintage Cadillac  
And it doesn't have fins in the back  
But it always gets me there and back  
  
And it will always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
  
I've got a beat up Silvertone amp  
I plug it in and it sounds like a champ  
It's not a Fender Tweed Deluxe  
It only cost me a couple of bucks  
  
And it will always sound good to me  
Always sound good to me  
Always sound good to me  
Always sound good to me  
  
I've got a girlfriend she's so true  
And no other kind of girl will do  
'Cause I've lots of girls in the past  
And I knew none of their love would last  
  
But this one will always be true to me  
Always be true to me  
Always be true to me  
Always be true to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me
