What's Wrong Wofie, are ya sick  
Something in your Throat?  
Wait A Minute are you trying to meow?  
Ah Fella  
I can see it when you're feeling low  
You can't hide that from me  
You're no status quo calico  
So why keep trying to be?  
'Cause you're more than that  
You're my doggish cat  
I wish you could see the you I see  
I say  
If you bark  
Celebrate it  
Make your mark  
Serenade it  
Noah's ark  
Shoulda had a cat like you  
And if  
What you are  
Is a strange you  
Doesn't mean  
You should change you  
Only means  
You should change your point of view  
  
Hey, feline  
You fetch just fine  
To thine ownself be true  
Your bow wow's  
The cat's meow  
It's how I know you're you  
  
You don't need the bows  
Or tiara  
Bid your woes  
Sayonara  
Trust your nose  
'Cause it knows the way to go  
When you  
Chase your tail  
You're enchanting  
Spirits sail  
When you're panting  
When you wail  
You're a rover, Romeo  
  
There is not  
One hair of you  
That I would rearrange  
I love you the way you are  
And that will never change  
That will never change
