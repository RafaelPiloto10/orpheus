Everyday, it's getting closer,  
Going faster than a roller coaster.  
A love like yours would surely come my way.  
Everyday, seems a little faster,  
All my friends, they say go on up and ask her.  
A love like yours would surely come my way.  
  
Everyday it seems a little stronger,  
Everyday it lasts a little longer.  
Come what may, do you ever long for  
True love from me?  
Everyday seems a little closer,  
Going faster than a roller coaster.  
A love like yours would surely come my way.  
A love like yours would surely come my way, Everyday.  
  
Everyday it seems a little stronger,  
Everyday it lasts a little longer.  
Come what may, do you ever long for  
True love from me?  
Like I long from you baby.  
Everyday seems a little closer,  
Going faster than a roller coaster.  
A love like yours would surely come my way.
