The only one I know  
Has come to take me away  
The only one I know  
Is mine when she stitches me  
  
The only one I see  
Has found an aching in me  
The only one I see  
Has turned her tongue into me  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
The only one I know  
Never cries, never open her eyes  
The only one I know  
Wide awake and then she's away  
  
The only one I see  
Is mine when she walks down our street  
The only one I see  
Has carved her way in to me  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
And everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain  
  
Everyone has been burned before  
Everybody knows the pain
