All I want is written on my face  
You'e bound to find something  
And all your words that held me into place  
Were nothing but lies  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
But I can't see  
Somebody...  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then don't know what I'll see  
Til then til then don't care what I'll see  
I'll stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes?  
Don't mind me  
You know me inside out  
That's the way that you left me  
And you won't find me  
Begging for a chance  
To have you burn me again.  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
But I can't see  
Somebody...  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then don't know what I'll see  
Til then til then don't care what I'll see  
I'll stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes?  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
Another place you might have left me here for dead  
Another time...  
Somebody...  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then don't know what I'll see  
Til then til then don't care what I'll see  
I'll stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes?  
Open my eyes.
