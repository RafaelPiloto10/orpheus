Deep in the South of Texas  
Not so long ago,  
There on a crowded island  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
  
It didn't take too much money,  
Man, but it sure was nice.  
You could dance all night if you felt all right,  
Drinking whiskey and throwing dice.  
  
And everybody knows  
It was hard to leave.  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese.  
  
Yeah, I remember Ruby,  
She always dressed in red  
Wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance  
With a rag wrapped around her head.  
  
And everybody knows  
It was hard to leave.  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese.  
  
And everybody knows  
It was hard to leave.  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese,  
It was down at the Balinese,  
It was down at the Balinese.
