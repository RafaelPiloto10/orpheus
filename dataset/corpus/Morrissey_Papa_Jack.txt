Papa Jack  
Wants to turn  
Back the clock  
And reach out  
To the kids  
He once had  
Who have flown  
  
Papa Jack  
In decline  
Feels inclined  
To reach out  
To the kids  
He once had  
Who have flown  
  
But there was a time  
When the kids reached up  
And Papa Jack just  
Pushed them away  
  
Looking deep  
In his heart  
Papa Jack  
Doesn't like  
What he sees  
Or the time  
On his hands  
  
The dying day  
The chilly sun  
Papa Jack  
All alone  
Sings slow  
Grieving and low  
  
But there was a time  
When the kids reached up  
Now you can't always  
Have it your way  
  
Papa Jack  
Ah...
