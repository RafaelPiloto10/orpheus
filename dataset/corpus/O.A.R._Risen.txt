I'm not quite sure how I got here  
A minute passed and I'm on my feet  
I never knew life could taste so good  
I need a little minute, just a moment to breathe  
No matter where I go, no matter who I see  
Well I'm reminded of my earlier days  
No matter where I roll, no matter what I know  
Well I'm reminded of my earlier ways  
But now I keep asking myself  
  
Wouldn't it be the best damn day  
If we all took time to breathe?  
Just one stolen paragraph  
In the book's written history  
Don't you sometimes wonder why  
People are afraid to smile?  
Don't look down we're gonna come around  
And it always come to  
back, crack of time eventually  
Just ascend with me  
  
I'm not quite sure when I woke up  
The night flew by as I lay asleep  
Who ever knew that life could feel so good?  
I need another minute  
Just a moment to breathe  
No matter where I go, no matter who I see  
Well I'm reminded of my earlier days  
No matter what I know, no matter where I roll  
Well I'm reminded of my earlier ways  
But now I keep asking myself  
Wouldn't it be the best damn day  
If we all took time to breathe?  
Just one stolen paragraph  
In the book's written history  
Don't you sometimes wonder why  
People are afraid to smile?  
Don't look down we're gonna come around and it always come to back,  
crack of time eventually  
  
Wouldn't it be the best damn day?  
Wouldn't it be a wonderful day?  
Wouldn't it be a glorious day?  
If we all took time to smile,  
Made just a minute for you and me  
Wouldn't it be the best damn day?
