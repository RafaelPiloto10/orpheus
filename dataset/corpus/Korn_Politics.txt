Everyone's corrupt  
You should just shut up  
Lay down, back off  
The demon you disrupted  
  
Don't want to talk about politics  
Don't preach or talk about politics  
Don't let me talk about politics  
Don't give a shit about politics  
  
You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know  
Think that's the way to go don't you?  
Its in religion, sex, and everything we do and say  
I look the other way won't you?  
  
Everybody's raped  
Lying to your face  
Kick's you in the gut  
Slayed you here on the stop  
  
Don't want to talk about politics  
Don't preach or talk about politics  
Don't let me talk about politics  
Don't give a shit about politics  
  
You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know  
Think that's the way to go don't you?  
Its in religion, sex, and everything we do and say  
I look the other way won't you?  
  
Tiniest dream living in your soul  
Darkest life in the deepest hole  
All the guilt from the things you've told  
What you thought was so much fun  
You'll have to pay for  
  
Don't want to talk about politics  
Don't preach or talk about politics  
Don't let me talk about politics  
Don't give a shit about politics  
  
You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know  
Think thats the way to go don't you?  
Its in religion, sex, and everything we do and say  
I look the other way won't you?  
  
Don't want to talk about politics  
Don't preach or talk about politics  
Don't let me talk about politics  
Don't give a shit about politics  
  
Don't want to talk about politics  
Don't preach or talk about politics  
Don't let me talk about politics  
Don't give a shit about politics!
