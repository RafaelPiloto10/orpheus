It's been a long time  
People change  
I missed you  
Word up  
I used to always think about you  
Even though sometimes I see you  
And I try to ignore you  
Deep inside I was thinkin' about you  
What do you think  
  
You are my life  
I have to go on  
Havin' me any way you want me baby  
Just love me til the tension's gone  
And don't you come too soon  
  
I'm patient I never come too soon  
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune  
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom  
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room  
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix  
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed  
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks  
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed  
And I cherish you forever believe me you  
You's a priceless treasure from my point of view  
It took time to change I'll admit that  
My back in the days love I had to get back  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my star ship  
Come take me up tonight  
And don't be late  
You are my star ship  
Come take me up tonight  
And don't be late  
And don't you come too soon  
(never that)  
  
I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again  
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend  
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons  
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom  
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves  
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave  
Now you ready I like that my love you save  
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave  
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete  
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet  
Back together reunited bonded once more  
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well now you know how I feel  
And I definitely know how you feel  
Word up  
I'm feelin' this  
Word up  
Cause wit' you by my side  
I'm a take it to the top yeah
