Kizutsuke atta kotoba mo  
Kasaneta namida mo  
Itsuka wa omoide ni naru yo  
Dakara togireta melody  
Mune ni dakishimete ashita mo ikiru darou  
Anata ni aenakute mo  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my heart  
Falling through the rain  
  
I sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you hold my tears  
Cause still I love you  
  
I can't face that thought of being alone  
I sing for the song still carries on  
Mune ni dakishimete omoi wo utawasete  
Koe ni naranakute mo  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my pain  
There's nothing I can do  
  
I still have a longing for your memory  
Kizutsuku dake demo  
Kokoro wo tsutaetai yo  
  
Ima wa hitori ni shinai de  
Furi sosogu ame ni niware sou na yume  
Ashita mo kanaderu kara  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my heart  
Falling through the rain  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my heart  
Falling through the rain
