You go through the motions  
Of a woman in love  
Every kiss is a token  
Every sigh is a bluff  
Words confuse me but I see it in your eyes  
You try not to show it  
But any fool would know it  
It's over... It's over this love is ending  
It's over... It's over there's no use pretending  
I see through your make up  
You're not quite yourself  
Don't you know that your games up  
I know there's somebody else  
You tell me I'm crazy and that I'm still the only one  
Well maybe I'm dreaming  
But I know what I'm feeling  
It's over... It's over this love is ending  
It's over... It's over there's no use pretending  
You fake your way through the night time  
But even your best is less than before  
'Cause you don't care anymore  
You tell me I'm crazy and that I'm still the only one  
Well maybe I'm dreaming  
But I know what I'm feeling  
It's over  
It's over  
It's over there's no use pretending  
It's over
