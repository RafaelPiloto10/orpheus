Why the day you were born, girl  
Your mom and I named you, Tanya Montana  
I just thought you should know  
  
Your eyes were  
As blue as the skies of Montana  
Your skin was  
As white as fresh falling snow  
  
Tanya Montana is some thing to see  
A dream that came true for your mother and me  
A small piece of Heaven on earth as they say  
But Tanya Montana is so far away  
  
Why some day you're gonna grow up  
And you're gonna leave us, sweet Tanya  
And some man will steal you  
Some man's gonna steal you away, I know  
  
But you know me and your momma  
Why we love you, Montana  
Lord, it's going to break our hearts  
When we see you go  
  
Tanya Montana has been on my mind  
Like the eagles that fly above reaching the light  
Searching for freedom, you'll find it some day  
And then Tanya Montana will be so far away
