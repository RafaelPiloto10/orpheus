Way down in Louisiana amongst the tall grown sugar canes  
Lived a simple man and a domineerin' hen and a rose of a different name  
The first time I fell lightly I was standing in the drizzlin' rain  
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin and a rose of a different name  
The devil made me do it the first time the second time I done it on my own  
Lord put a handle on a simple handed man and help me leave that black rose
alone  
  
When the devil made that woman Lord she threw the pattern away  
She was built for speed with the tools you need to make a new fool every day  
Way down deep and dirty on the darker side of shame  
You caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin with a rose of a different
name  
The devil made me do it the first time  
The devil made me do it the first time
