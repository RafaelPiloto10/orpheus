It's Friday night  
I'm tired of searching for this life  
The week's been cruel to me  
I just want to feel alright  
And all over town the word's been going around  
Where I want to be  
Is wherever you'll be found  
  
Mmm Hmm  
And now it takes up nearly all of my time  
Oh and I need  
I need some way  
I need some way to get you off my mind  
  
Oh cause sometimes when you get close to me  
It brings me close to heaven  
But I can't get in  
Ah No no no  
And the more you shy away from me  
To search for something better  
It hurts me slow  
And I don't know  
'Cause I'm the squid  
  
And now all this time I wait for you to realize  
I'll treat you lovingly  
Oh open up your eyes  
And once again I say I need you my friend  
Touch your lips to me  
I'll be your cigarette  
Yeah  
  
You know I love you so  
But I don't know  
And I won't know  
Exactly where we're gonna go  
Gonna go, no  
  
'Cause sometimes when you get close to me  
It brings me close to heaven  
But I can't get in  
Ah no no no  
And the more you shy away from me  
To search for something better  
It hurts me slow  
I still don't know  
'Cause I'm the squid
