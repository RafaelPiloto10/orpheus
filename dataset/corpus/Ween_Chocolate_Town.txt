Couldn't taste the taste that I was tastin'  
Couldn't hear the waste that I was makin'  
Tired of the life I was facin'  
  
Couldn't tell one from another  
Couldn't hide a secret from my mother  
Any other mother wouldn't bother  
  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
  
Got me on the porch I'm in the front row  
Says "shit's for real man" like I don't know  
Get your punk ass back to the dog show  
  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
  
A new breath I feel the grip releasin'  
Scraping my guts off of the ceiling  
I've got that sunny bunny feeling  
  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Greyhound bus to chocolate town
