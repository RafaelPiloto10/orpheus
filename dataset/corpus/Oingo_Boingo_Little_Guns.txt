Tiny people, with little guns  
Little armies march, to little drums  
What do they want?  
What do they want?  
Tiny soldiers, with little guns  
Little tanks, no bigger than your thumb  
They want you  
Little people, with tiny brains  
Little bullets flowing, in their veins  
What do they want?  
What do they want?  
Tiny people with little guns  
Little armies march, to little drums  
They want you, you  
You, you, you, you  
Little airplanes, with tiny bombs  
Little squadrons, dropping thimbles of Napalm  
They want you  
What do they want?  
What do they want?  
Tiny people, with little guns  
Little armies march, to little drums  
You, you  
You, you, you, you  
Tiny people, little guns  
Tiny people, little guns  
Tiny people, little guns
