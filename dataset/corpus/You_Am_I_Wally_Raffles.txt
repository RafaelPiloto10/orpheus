Walter quit the RAF  
When there was no good air left.  
Made it back to the clan.  
The dog, the wife, the betting slip wet in his hand.  
And no one's listening.  
To the boys  
Tim, Jaimme and Gab.  
Keeping him up while his mistress rings his hands.  
Picked him up after school  
Just make sure you're looking good.  
And no one's leaving.  
  
Walter plays.  
Get off your knees.  
Walter plays.  
Get off your knees.  
  
It's mini coke and prawns again  
In his room or on the sand.  
Not a day before he fell  
Propping up the bar at the Raffle's hotel.  
And no one' leaving.  
  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees.  
Give the kids a hand  
Down on the sand.  
  
No one's listening.  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees.  
Give the kids a hand  
Down on the sand.
