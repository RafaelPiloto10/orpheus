Sweetheart,  
I'm changing my role in life.  
I'm not rearranging the main things in my life.  
I ain't sacrificing what I hold as true.  
I ain't sacrificing, sweetheart, even for you.  
  
Sweetheart, I'm changing my mode of life.  
I'm not rearranging the main things in my life.  
I'm not giving up, now, in mixed company.  
I'll be holding on, now, looking to find my identity.  
  
My freedom means too much to give up now.  
It doesn't matter to you anyhow.  
  
Sweetheart.  
Sweetheart.  
  
My freedom means too much to give up now,  
And did it matter so much anyhow.
