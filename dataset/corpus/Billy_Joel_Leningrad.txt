Victor was born  
The spring of '44  
And never saw  
His father anymore  
A child of sacrifice  
A child of war  
Another son who never had  
A father after Leningrad  
Went off to school  
And learned to serve the state  
Follow the rules  
And drank his vodka straight  
The only way to live  
Was drown the hate  
The Russian life was very sad  
And such was life in Leningrad  
  
I was born in '49  
A Cold War kid in McCarthy time  
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel  
Blast those yellow reds to hell  
Cold war kids were hard to kill  
Under their desks in an air raid drill  
Haven't they heard we won the war  
What do they keep on fighting for?  
  
Victor was sent  
To some Red Army town  
Served out his time  
Become a circus clown  
The greatest happiness  
He'd ever found  
Was making Russian children glad  
And children lived in Leningrad.  
  
The children lived in Levittown  
Hid in the shelters underground  
Til the Soviets turned their ships around  
And tore the Cuban missiles down  
And in that bright October sun  
We knew our childhood days were done  
I watched my friends go off to war  
What do they keep on fighting for?  
  
So my child and I came to this place  
To meet him, eye to eye and face to face  
He made my daughter laugh  
Then we embraced  
We never knew what friends we had  
Until we came to Leningrad.
