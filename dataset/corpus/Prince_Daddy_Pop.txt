Oh daddy  
Oh, sock it to me  
  
See my brother talkin' plently head  
Steady wishin' he could sleep in your bed  
Steady wishin' he was in your car  
Just a steady wishin' that he was who you are  
  
Pop daddy, daddy pop  
Brother steady talkin' while  
The girlies steady hop  
Pop daddy, daddy pop  
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock (oh daddy)  
  
See all the people wonder why  
You set your goals high, high as the sky  
See the people runnin' from the truth  
Livin' in the past  
When they need to be livin' the new  
  
Pop daddy (oh yeah) daddy pop  
Brother steady talkin' while  
The girlies steady hop  
Pop daddy, daddy pop  
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock  
  
Pop, daddy pop  
Pop, punchin' in the rock and roll clock  
Talk, guitar, talk

Daddy pop is the writer and love is the book  
You better look it over before you overlook  
  
One, oh daddy  
Two, oh yeah  
Three, oh, sock it to me  
Four, oh (come on), your the best  
  
See all my critics wastin' time  
Worryin' about the daddy while he beat you blind  
Get your life together, stop your cryin'  
Whenever you say that you can't,  
That's when you need to be tryin'  
  
Pop daddy, daddy pop (oh daddy)  
Brother steady talkin' while (steady, steady, steady)  
The girlies steady hop  
Pop daddy, daddy pop  
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock (punchin' in, punchin' in)  
  
What kind of fool is this, that thinks daddy will miss  
What kind of boy would dis, a list, as long as his-tory itself  
I got grooves and grooves up on the shelf (oh daddy)  
Deep purple concord jams (oh yeah)  
This party I will slam (i don't think)  
I don't think you understand (sock it to me)  
Whatever you can't do, daddy can  
The one and only daddy pop  
(oh daddy) one and only, daddy pop  
  
Pop daddy, daddy pop (oh no, my brother)  
Brother steady talkin' while  
The girlies steady hop (there ain't no stoppin')  
Pop daddy, daddy pop (check the record, yeah!)  
Punchin' in the rock and roll clock  
  
Poppa daddy's commin'
