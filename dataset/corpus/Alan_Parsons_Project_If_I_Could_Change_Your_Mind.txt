I prefer to spend my time in solitary ways  
Keeping myself to myself  
Can't pretend that it's been easy since you went away  
Living with somebody else  
  
If you should change your mind  
If you should turn around and look behind  
If you could see me the way I used to be  
At the risk of bringing back the sorrow and despair  
  
I would do it all again  
Holding on to memories and pretending not to care  
Knowing that the show was soon to end  
If only I could change your mind  
  
If only you would change  
If I had the chance I'd do it all again  
I would do it all again  
  
I remember windy shores on menancholy days  
Drifting along with the tide  
And the joy of simple things and ordinary ways  
Taking it all in my stride  
  
If you should change your mind  
If I could let you see what lies behind  
If you could see need me the way it used to be  
  
Even for the moment of the happy times we shared  
Living in my dreams since then  
At the risk of losing only castles in the air  
Come with me and we can try again  
Oh, if I could change your mind  
  
Can't pretend it's been lonely since you went away  
Oh, if I could change your mind
