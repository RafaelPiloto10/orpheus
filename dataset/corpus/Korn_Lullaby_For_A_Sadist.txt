It's easy I walk the circle I come down long ago  
But somehow I get lost each time  
Feeding this song that deepens inside that never ends  
The voice within eats me up inside  
  
1 I love hurting you  
2 I love your pain  
3 Lets get together and play this sin ours game  
4 is for the torture and  
5 is for the shame  
Cause ever time you want it I get off on this game  
  
You wanted to play the coldness follows  
This isn't a game your life full swallow  
And I can't help to smile at your pain  
You wanted to play but I already won  
  
Golding I plant the seed inside your head right away  
Watch it grow, destroying your insides  
Pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways  
I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile  
  
1 I love hurting you  
2 I love your pain  
3 Lets get together and play this sin ours game  
4 is for the torture and  
5 is for the shame  
'cause ever time you want it I get off on this game  
  
You wanted to play the coldness follows  
This isn't a game your life full swallow  
And I can't help to smile at your pain  
You wanted to play but I already won  
  
I look at you and start to crack start to crack  
I give it to you take it back, take it back  
This lullaby is all you have, all you have  
Sadistic pleasure I attack, I attack  
I attack  
I attack  
I attack  
I attack  
  
You wanted to play the coldness follows  
This isn't a game your life full swallow  
I can't help to smile at your pain  
You wanted to play but I already won  
I already won  
I already won
