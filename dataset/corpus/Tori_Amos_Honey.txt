A little dust never stopped me none, he liked my shoes I kept them on.  
Sometimes I can hold my tongue, sometimes not,  
When you just skip-to-loo, my darlin',  
And you know what you're doin' so don't even  
  
You're just too used to my honey, now.  
You're just too used to my honey.  
  
And I think I could leave your world,  
If she was the better girl.  
So when we died I tried to bribe the undertaker.  
'Cause I'm not sure what you're doin' or the reasons.  
  
You're just too used to my honey, now.  
You're just too used to my honey.  
Hey, yeah you're just too used to my honey, now.  
  
Don't bother coming down,  
I made a friend of the western sky.  
Don't bother coming down,  
You always like your babies tight.  
  
Turn back one last time, love to watch those cowboys ride.  
But cowboys know cowgirls ride on the Indian side.  
And you know what you're doin' so don't even  
  
You're just too used to my honey, now.  
You're just too used to my honey.  
Hey, yeah you're just too used to my honey, now.  
You're just too used to my honey, now.
