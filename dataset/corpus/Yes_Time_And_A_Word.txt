In the morning when you rise,  
Do you open up your eyes, see what I see?  
Do you see the same things ev'ry day?  
Do you think of a way to start the day  
Getting things in proportion?  
Spread the news and help the world go 'round.  
Have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again?  
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?  
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear  
When you get things in perspective.  
Spread the news and help the word go round.  
  
There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,  
It's right for me, and the time is now.  
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,  
It's right for me, and the word is love.
