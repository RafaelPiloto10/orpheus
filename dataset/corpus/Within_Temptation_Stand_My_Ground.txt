I can see  
When you stay low  
Nothing happens  
Does it feel right?  
Late at night  
Things I thought I'd put behind me  
Haunt my mind  
  
I just know there's no escape now  
Once it sets it's eyes on you  
But I won't run  
Have to stare it in the eyes  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in  
No more denying  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
Stand my ground  
  
It's all around  
Getting stronger, coming closer into my world  
I can feel that it's time for me to face it  
Can I take it?  
  
Though this might just be the ending  
Of the life I held so dear  
But I won't run  
There's no turning back from here  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in  
No more denying  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
Stand my ground  
  
All I know for sure is that I'm trying  
I will always stand my ground  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in, (I won't give in)  
I won't give up, (I won't give up)  
No more denying (ah)  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in  
No more denying  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
Stand my ground
