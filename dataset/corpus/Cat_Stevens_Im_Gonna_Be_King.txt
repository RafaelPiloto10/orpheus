I've been pushed around  
Made to look a clown  
But now, now I know  
It is time for me to start to grow  
I'm gonna be king  
I'm gonna see things right  
I'm gonna be king  
And you will be my bride  
I'll show everyone  
That my time will come  
If you wait for me  
I will show the world what I can be  
I'm gonna be king  
I'm gonna see things right  
I'm gonna be king  
And you will be my bride  
Love does funny things  
And to me it brings  
Strength to carry through  
And to make my name a pride to use  
I'm gonna be king  
I'm gonna see things right  
I'm gonna be king  
And you will be my bride
