Nothing else can make me feel this way  
Like your presence in my life, everyday  
How can I explain the way you make me feel  
Cos Jesus your love for me is so unreal  
  
I wanna be where you are  
I wanna stand at your feet  
Jesus to be where you are  
It makes me wanna sing  
  
Ill praise you everysingle day  
I can't stop lovin you always  
Jesus to be where you are, it makes me wana sing your praise  
  
I wanna be with you  
I wanna be with you  
I wanna be with you every single day  
  
I wanna be with you  
I wanna be with you  
I wanna be with you every single day
