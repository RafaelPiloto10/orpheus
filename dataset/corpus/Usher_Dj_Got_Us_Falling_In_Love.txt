Usher (yeah man)  
So we back in the club  
With our bodies rockin' from side to side (side to side)  
Thank God the week is done  
I feel like a zombie goin' back to life (back to life)  
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up  
No control of my body  
Ain't I seen you before?  
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes  
  
'Cause baby tonight,  
The D-J got us falling in love again  
Yeah, baby tonight,  
The D-J got us falling in love again  
So dance, dance,  
Like it's the last,  
Last night of your life, life  
Gon' get you right  
'Cause baby tonight,  
The D-J got us falling in love again  
  
Keep downing drinks like there's  
No tomorrow there's just right  
Now, now, now, now, now, now  
  
Gonna set the roof on fire  
Gonna burn this mother fucker  
Down, down, down, down, down, down  
  
Hands up, when the music drops  
We both put our hands up  
Put your hands on my body  
Swear I seen you before  
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes  
  
'Cause baby tonight,  
The D-J got us falling in love again  
Yeah, baby tonight,  
The D-J got us falling in love again  
So dance, dance,  
Like it's the last,  
Last night of your life, life  
Gonna get you right  
'Cause baby tonight,  
The D-J got us falling in love again  
  
Usher, don't lie  
Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil  
Get it baby? Hope you catch that like T-O  
That's how we roll, my life is a movie, and you just TIVO  
Mami got me twisted' like a dreadlock  
She don't wrestle but I got her in a headlock  
Yabadabadoo make her bedrock mami on fire, (psh) so red hot  
Bada bing bada boom Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room  
I'm a hustler baby, but that you knew, and tonight it's just me and you  
  
'Cause baby tonight, the D-J got us falling in love again  
Yeah, baby tonight, the D-J got us falling in love again  
So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life  
Gon' get you right  
  
'Cause baby tonight, the D-J got us falling in love again  
Yeah, baby tonight, the D-J got us falling in love again  
So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life  
Gonna get you right
