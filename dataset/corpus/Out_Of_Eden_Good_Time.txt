I've been down and out wondering what it all about  
So many pressures and the burden seemed too much for me to bear  
I tried to fight it, but there were shackles on my hands  
Tried to deny it, 'til oppression took command  
Turned to the Savior and He opened up my eyes  
It caught me by surprise, told me somethin' that was no lie  
Chorus:  
It's a good time, a good time to be free  
It's a good time, time to get free inside  
It's a good time, a good time to believe  
It's a good time, time to get free inside  
Now you're down and out wondering what your life's about  
Try to laugh your fears away, so you party everyday  
What you are feeling, there ain't nothing new to find  
What you don't know is, your life is on the line  
Time to discover, there's so much more to this than just the way you live  
I know someone with freedom to give  
(chorus)  
So let your spirit hear, and put your mind behind  
There's a freedom that only in Him you'll find  
If you heed the call you will have all you need  
'Cause who the Son sets free you know is free, free indeed  
(chorus)  
What do you want to do with your life  
Its up to you, you've got to decide  
There's freedom here if you want it, just make up your mind  
It is a good time  
(chorus)  
(bridge)  
(chorus out)
