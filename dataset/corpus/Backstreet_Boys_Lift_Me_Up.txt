Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up. Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up...  
  
When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul  
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control  
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know  
You still care for me, say a prayer for me, and I know  
  
Oooh, I like you hangin' around  
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Oooh, you are my favorite sound  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day  
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load  
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity  
Would you hold my hand?  
Say you understand my pain  
  
Oooh, I like you hangin' around  
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Oooh, you are my favorite sound  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
It's been a long hard road, and it's only just begun, my friend  
And this I know  
You helped me carry the load  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
Well, you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I don't wanna let you go  
'Cause you lift me up now  
Well, you're always around..  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up now  
You lift me up  
Lift me up now  
Yeah, you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
  
Lift me up
