You say you love me  
Well they feel like words to me  
Well this just ain't working  
Stop thinking you can run over me  
I'm drifting, I'm settling  
Off to a foreign place  
If I can't see what's in front of me  
It's a mystery, well then apparently  
  
Things just ain't the same  
And I'm ready for change  
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long  
Can't you see that you're  
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-a-away  
Away, away, away, away  
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized  
Today, today, it's too late  
You're fading away  
  
Put a sock in it just stop running your mouth  
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again  
No way, no way, no way, no way  
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy you got me messed up  
If we hookin' back up, don't press your luck today, today  
I'm blowing you away  
  
Things just ain't the same  
And I'm ready for change  
Go on, begone, tata so long  
Can't you see that you're  
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-a-away  
Away, away, away, away  
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized  
Today, today, it's too late  
You're fading away  
  
Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes  
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?  
I'm about to go insane  
I'm jumping off this train  
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night  
  
Can't you see that you're  
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-a-away  
Away, away, away, away  
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized  
Today, today, it's too late  
You're fading away
