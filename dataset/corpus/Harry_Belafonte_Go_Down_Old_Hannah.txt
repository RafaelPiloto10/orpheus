Lyrics:  
Oh, we call the sun ol' Hannah  
Blazing on my head  
Yes, we call the sun ol' Hannah  
And her hair is flamin' red.  
Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah  
Don't you rise no more  
If you come up in the mornin'  
Bring judgment sure  
Well I look at ol' Hannah  
She was turnin' red  
Well I look at my partner  
He was almost dead  
Said if you get lucky,  
Or make it on your own  
Please go down by Julie's  
Tell her I won't be long  
Kept sayin' I was a good man  
But they drove me down  
Yes, I was a good man,  
But they drove me down  
Well, it look like ev'rything  
Ev'rything I do  
Yes, it looks like ev'rything  
I do is wrong
