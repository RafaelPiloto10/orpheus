She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
Not long ago I was,  
A sad and lonely boy,  
Did not know how to get better,  
  
Then heaven up above,  
Sent me a super love,  
And now I'm happy forever.  
  
No one wants to believe,  
I've got a perfect love,  
They say I'm just talking crazy,  
  
But I can prove it's true,  
If you'll allow me to,  
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady  
  
She's all that I could explore,  
She's more than a dream,  
She's my everything  
  
She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
Whoever thought I would,  
Be feeling half this good,  
The world for me is new place,  
  
I'll drink to happiness,  
Because our love's the best,  
The wine for me has a new taste,  
  
I'll let my lady know,  
I'll never let her go,  
Forever I'm gonna hold on,  
  
She said she feel's the same,  
Don't wanna play no game,  
Just wants our love to live on and on,  
  
Wish I could fly to the sky,  
And write out her name,  
  
Climb to the top of the world,  
And loudly exclaim,  
She's my everything  
(She's my everything)  
  
I love (that superlady)  
I love (that superlady)  
I love (that superlady)  
I love (that superlady)  
  
She 's much, too much,  
she's got that super love  
She's much, too much for my heart
