Two people touching lips  
Hands on each others hips  
Nothing else in the world but one another  
The forty second floor  
On a distant shore  
I wonder how we strayed so far from this  
  
Remember when we were  
Just flesh and bone you sir  
May have forgotten how good your world can be  
So put down your hollow tips  
And kiss you lovers lips  
And know that fate is what we make of it  
Please end this please end this before it ends us, ends us, ends  
  
I want to stay inside  
I want to stay inside for good  
I want to stay inside for good for good for good for good  
  
I read the news today  
And everything they say  
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait  
But the better part of me knows  
That waiting in the throws  
Is on a par with reading while my eyes are closed  
  
"what can I do"? you say  
"its just another day  
In the life of apes with ego trips!"  
Put down your hollow tips  
And kiss your lovers lips  
And know that fate is what we make of it  
  
Please end this please end this before it ends us, ends us, ends us  
I want to stay inside  
I want to stay inside for good  
I want to stay inside for good for good  
Oh  
I'm gonna stay inside  
I'm gonna stay inside for good  
I'm gonna stay inside for good for good  
I want to stay inside  
I want to stay inside for good  
I want to stay inside  
Don't want to stay inside for good  
Don't want to stay inside for good for good for good
