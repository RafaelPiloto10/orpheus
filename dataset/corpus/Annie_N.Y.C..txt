Warbucks  
  
What is it about you  
You're big  
You're loud  
You're tough nyc  
I go years without you  
Then I  
Can't get  
Enough  
Enough of the cab drivers answering back  
In the language far from pure  
Enough of frankfurters answering back  
Brother, you know you're in nyc  
Too busy  
Too crazy  
Too hot  
Too cold  
Too late  
I'm sold  
Again  
On nyc  
  
(spoken)  
Come on you slowpokes, we gotta get to the Roxy before the prices change.  
  
New yorkers, grace, annie and warbucks  
  
Nyc  
  
Grace  
  
The shadows at sundown  
The roofs  
That scrape  
The sky  
  
All  
  
Nyc  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
The rich and the rundown  
The parade  
Goes by  
  
Warbucks  
  
No other town has the Empire State  
And a mayor five foot two  
No other town in  
The whole forty eight  
Can half compare  
To you  
  
All  
  
Oh nyc  
  
Warbucks  
  
You make 'em all postcards  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
You crowd  
You cramp  
You're still  
The champ  
Amen For nyc (Nyc)  
The shimmer of Times Square  
  
Warbucks  
  
The pulse  
  
Grace  
  
The beat  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
The drive! (Nyc)  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
The city's bright  
As a penny arcade  
It blinks, it tilts, it rings  
  
Annie  
  
To think that I've lived here all of my life  
And never seen these things  
  
All  
  
Oh, nyc  
The whole world keeps coming  
  
Warbucks  
  
By bus  
  
Grace  
  
By train  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
You can't  
Explain  
Their yen  
For  
  
Star to be  
  
Nyc  
  
Just got here this morning  
Three bucks  
Two bags  
One me  
Nyc  
  
I give you fair warning  
Up there  
In lights  
I'll be  
Go ask the Gershwins or Kaufman and Hart  
The place they love the best  
Though California pays big for their art  
Their fan mail comes addressed to nyc  
Tomorrow a penthouse  
That's way up high  
Tonight  
The "Y"  
Why not  
It's nyc  
  
All  
  
Nyc  
You're standing room only  
You crowd  
You cramp  
You're still  
The champ  
Amen For ny  
  
Man  
  
(spoken)  
Keep it quiet down there!  
  
All (Quietly)

Immediate seating... There is immediate seating.  
  
Warbucks  
  
(spoken)  
Popcorn, what do you say to some popcorn? I haven't had popcorn since...
(Annie yawns)  
  
(singing)  
Give in  
Don't fight  
Good girl  
Good night  
Sleep tight  
In nyc
