As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains  
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting  
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier  
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver  
  
[Chorus]  
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da  
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o  
There's whiskey in the jar  
  
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny  
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny  
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me  
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber  
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder  
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water  
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel  
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell  
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier  
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling  
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling  
but I take delight in the juice of the barley  
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army  
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney  
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney  
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny  
  
[Chorus]
