My father used to say  
You sleep with dogs the next day  
You'll wake up in the bed scratching  
Those inevitable fleas  
At ten years old  
You listen to what you're told  
But I never felt the itch  
I never would  
  
My mother had forbidden me  
To waste away my life  
I want you to have all the things  
I could never buy you  
So don't stop what I'd begun  
You're my one and only son  
Follow what I say, not what I've done  
Follow what I say, not what I've done  
  
Shower, scrub, and shave  
Cleanly boys don't misbehave  
  
Follow what I say, not what I've done
