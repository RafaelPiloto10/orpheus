It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel all right  
  
You know I work all day  
To get you money to buy you things  
And it's worth it just to hear you say  
?You're gonna give me everything?  
  
So why on earth should I moan?  
'Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel all right  
  
When I'm home  
Everything seems to be right  
When I'm home  
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah  
  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel okay, oh!  
  
So why on earth should I moan?  
'Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel all right  
  
When I'm home  
Everything seems to be right  
When I'm home  
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah  
  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel all right  
You know I feel all right  
You know I feel all right
