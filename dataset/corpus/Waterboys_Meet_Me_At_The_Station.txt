Well if I get to heaven before you do  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
I'll be watching and waiting, Mother dear, for you  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Father, when the train  
Father, when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train  
Father, when the train comes along  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
  
Well if my eyes see the glory, before yours do  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
I'll be watching and waiting, Father, for you  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Now if my feet touch the home line before yours do  
I will meet you at the station when the train comes along  
I'll be watching and waiting, my brother, for you  
I will meet you at the station when the train comes along  
  
[Repeat: 2X]  
When the train  
When the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train  
When the train comes along  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
  
Now if you see God's country before I do  
Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along  
Will you be there watching, sister, for me  
Will you meet
