[Verse]  
She don't really drink much so she say  
But by the way she was putting in the Malibu Reds away  
She was either 'bout that life  
Tryna front but tryna get right  
Or maybe she work hard, everyday, at her job  
And she feel like she deserve to turn up tonight  
Either way, miss lady bad as a Toblerone sugar rush  
I drew her near, whispered in her ear  
"I think that I'm developing a little crush"  
She said "Nice try, but every short skirt that done walked by has successfully
caught your eye  
No thanks but I'm sure that you're a nice guy"  
Damn, I had no reply, cause she was right  
Newly single so I've been a little thirsty  
She was more than just a booty in a skirt she  
Walked a way I caught up to her in a hurry  
I said "Can I at least know your name before your dead me"  
She turned around and said "My name's integrity"  
Integrity, can you answer this for me  
  
[Hook] (x2)  
Baby where do you wanna go?  
I'll do what you say  
She pointed to the top  
She said take me all the way  
Matter of fact I'll meet you there  
Woah, I fell in love  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh Integrity  
I think that I need you and me babe  
And me babe  
  
[Hook] (x2)  
Baby where do you wanna go?  
I'll do what you say  
She pointed to the top  
She said take me all the way  
Matter of fact I'll meet you there  
Woah, I fell in love  
  
[Outro]  
Integrity, damn
