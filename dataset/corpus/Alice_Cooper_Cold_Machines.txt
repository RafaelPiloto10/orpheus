I see you working at your station  
Radiation burns my eyes  
Love's forbidden so is passion  
This whole place is sterilized  
  
I just want to see tomorrow  
Day by day to just survive  
But this place is built to kill me  
No one here gets out alive  
  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Just a memory  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Gone  
  
You don't know my name  
You don't know my number  
You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)  
We walk right past each other, every single day  
Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on  
  
Got your thumb print always with me  
Got your barcode memorized  
They came here to electroshock me  
But can they erase you from my mind?  
  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Just a memory  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Gone  
  
You don't know my name  
You don't know my number  
You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)  
We walk right past each other, every single day  
Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on  
  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Just a memory  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
Gone  
  
You don't know my name  
You don't know my number  
You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)  
We walk right past each other, every single day  
Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on
