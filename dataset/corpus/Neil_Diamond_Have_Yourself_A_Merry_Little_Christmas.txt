Christmas future is far away  
Christmas past is past  
Christmas present is here today  
Bringing joy that will last  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on,  
Our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on,  
Our troubles will be miles away  
  
And here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shinning star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together  
If the fates allows  
Hang a shinning star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now
