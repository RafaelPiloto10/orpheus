I sit by my window, watch the clouds go by  
Every moment is a one that I'm  
Crying my heart out cause I'm not there with you  
I feel like a fool I've got so much shame  
I know I should just walk away  
But what will I do with all this pain I feel for you  
  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'll have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this time  
  
So many nights I lay in bed  
I stare at the place where you laid your head  
I wonder who's lying with you instead of me  
I can't make you feel it if it isn't there  
No way to convince you if you just don't care  
Look in your heart maybe you could spare a place for me  
  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'd have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this time  
  
You made your point  
It's clear to me  
There's somewhere else you'd rather be  
But I can't bear the thought of life without you  
  
I sit by my window, watch the clouds go by  
But I can't bear the thought of life without you  
  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'd have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this.  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'd have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this time
