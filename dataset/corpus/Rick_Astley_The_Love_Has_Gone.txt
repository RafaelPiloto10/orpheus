The love has gone  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
Wake up beside you, and hear you breathing  
And I can feel you in my arms  
No one can know just how I'm feeling  
Knowing that our love can come to no harm  
  
But as I open my eyes  
Then I start to realize  
That you're gone and I can't go on  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
What have I done girl, to make you leave me  
Didn't I love you for all those years  
  
If you open your eyes  
Baby, then you'll realize  
That you're wrong, and I can't go on  
You know I can't go on  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
Nothing will ever come between us  
If you will just take me back once more  
I'll show you just how much I love you  
If you'll just come walking through that door  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain
