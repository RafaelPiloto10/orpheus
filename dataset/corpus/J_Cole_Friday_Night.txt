Yeah,  
Hey,  
Yeah,  
  
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable  
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huckstable  
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like lunchables  
Like white boys in grade school  
We ate school made food just  
Eyeing they sh-t, wish I was trying they sh-t  
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn't buying that sh-t  
No I aint crying a bit man  
That's just life that's just how shit work  
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt  
Gotta learn when you get hurt  
Even if it's with cupid  
He beat you and you went back  
Who's officially stupid  
Oh yeah I understand that's your man,  
You had a plan  
You been together for some years  
You sticking with him for the kids  
So you overlook the tears but we both know that's a bad look  
Cause 20 years from now your daughter will probably get her ass whooped  
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use  
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce  
Cole, cole, cole  
  
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use  
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce  
It's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move  
A I'll ass n-gga who just so happened to stay in school  
Still rap for hustlers and muthaf-ckers that hated school  
Said that's for busters that heard my sh-t and I made it cool  
This aint to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping  
I got gangsta n-ggas that lining up in that missions office  
And possibly cause all the hoe n-ggas scrape  
And I sh-t up on my plate so you know a n-gga late to my first class  
I'd much rather sit up in first class  
Should I admit that a slutty b-tch was my first smash  
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out  
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about  
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout  
I used to ask for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind  
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind  
Was just a young boy staring out my blind  
Till I got free from my momma leash  
Running loose through the streets  
Like a stray dog in heat  
And we looking for some freaks can you play  
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame  
No not me  
She do hours on the team cause she seen how tall I'd be  
In the club dappin' n-ggas, even til he are-I-P  
Damn, you win some, you lose some  
That just how it's happens  
And if a n-gga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em  
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom  
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping  
Cause see some n-ggas was haters that I viewed as clowns  
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around  
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now  
If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down  
[End]
