When I was young, my mind would always wander away  
I couldn't talk, never had nothin to say  
But now I'm grown, nothing much seems to have changed  
I think I'm going insane yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is this a fairy tale, are you the seven dwarves  
Did Snow White really die while fighting in the war?  
They were the only friends I ever trusted  
Now they're scattered, and livin' in the city  
Unlisted numbers, Huh  
Cinderella undercover  
I say, better alive than dead  
The war is coming, but there's nothing much that we can do  
Stuck in a pay-phone, but the operator won't let me through  
I close my eyes, but the memories burn in my brain  
I think I'm going insane yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I heard a rumor, they said it's gone nuclear  
I stockpile cigarettes, and double bold the door  
A sanctuary for all my friends  
We'll stay in bed until the world ends  
So please don't wake me, I gotta get some sleep  
Cinderella Undercover  
I say, better alive than dead  
I think I'm going insane, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is this a fairy tale, this can't be real  
There's fighting all around, they're shooting in the fields  
They say that values change when hunger or ambition strikes  
Survival is essential, at any cost or any price  
The cartoon animals on Old McDonald's farm  
Are nodding off in hotel rooms with needles in their arms  
The seven dwarves, HA!, there's only four alive today  
Cinderella's working for the CIA  
Cinderella, the fairy tale's over  
You should know, you got the scars to prove it  
And your skin isn't as soft as it used to  
But I don't care, come on you said it baby  
Cinderella undercover  
I say, better alive than  
Cinderella undercover  
I say, better alive than dead
