Bright lights, big city  
Gone to my baby's head  
Bright lights, big city  
Gone to my baby's head  
  
I'd tried to tell the woman  
But she doesn't believe a word I said  
Go light pretty baby  
Gonna need my help some day  
It's all right pretty baby  
Gonna need my help some day  
  
You're gonna wish you listened  
To some of those things I said  
  
Go ahead pretty baby  
Oh, honey knock yourself out  
Go ahead pretty baby  
Oh honey knock yourself out  
  
I still love you baby  
Cause you don't know what it's all about  
  
Bright lights, big city  
Gone to my baby's head  
Bright lights, big city  
Gone to my baby's head
