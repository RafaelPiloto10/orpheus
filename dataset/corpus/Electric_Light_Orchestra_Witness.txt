I saw an ant devour sherman mountain.  
Slip across the floor in the river of honey.  
I saw the locust drinking from a fountain.  
It smiled at me as I paid my money.  
Chorus  
Caus' I'm a witness, witness, see the writing on the wall.  
I'm a witness, witness, I say I've seen it all.  
Caus' I'm a witness, witness, I've got all the proof.  
I'm a witness, witness, I swear to tell the truth.  
I saw her buying in the face of fashion.  
Who'll believe with her little white lies.  
I saw her arrive on my bed of passion.  
But I never saw a look of love in her eyes.  
Chorus  
Some days my eyes can see for miles and miles around.  
Some nights my dreams just take me deep underground.  
My minds a time machine, I'm in the future and the past.  
The past... scrape away...  
(violin solo)  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Witness, witness, witness  
Witness, witness, witness  
Witness, witness, witness  
Witness, witness, witness
