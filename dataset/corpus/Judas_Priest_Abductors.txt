Abductors they come at night  
  
They come at night and they infiltrate you  
They paralyze and they mentally rape you  
Expressionless they disintegrate you  
The probe your soul and desecrate you  
  
Abductors will bleed your mind  
Abductors cutting inside  
They come for you in the night  
  
They strap you instruments laid before you  
And powerless begin to explore you  
You scream in pain but they just ignore you  
The bring machines and they drill and bore you  
  
Abductors cutting inside  
Abductors drinking your mind  
  
No-one believes that you  
Were chosen from few  
Defiled and abused  
By alien rituals  
  
You wake in fright there in your room  
You better hope your memory fails you  
A lower form of life to them  
Just one more blood experiment  
  
Abductors will bleed your mind  
Abductors cutting inside  
They come for you in the night  
  
You wake in fright there in your room  
You better hope your memory fails you  
A lower form of life to them  
Just one more blood experiment  
  
They send you back and disorientate you  
A lesser race they discriminate you  
Whatever said will incriminate you  
No-one believes  
  
The skeptics laugh an annihilate you  
They dig you out and they excavate you  
Authority and even God forsakes you  
No-one believes  
  
Hey maybe I am just a liar
