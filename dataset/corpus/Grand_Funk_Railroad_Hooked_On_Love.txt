Well, did you ever have something, you want the whole wide world to know
about?  
It's that something I must tell you, that you just can't live without.  
Ten times your fingers, and double your toes,  
That's how much I love you and how much it shows.  
  
CHORUS  
You know that I am ... hooked on love.  
I'll tell you what I am ... hooked on love.  
Believe me when I say it ... hooked on love.  
Hooked on love, ohhhh ...  
  
My brothers and sisters, hear what I say.  
I'm gonna' love you, to my dying day.  
When I tell you that I love you, well, at least I tried.  
I want you to believe me, this ain't no lie.  
  
CHORUS  
  
Satisfy my need in life, now, let me hear you say.  
You'll be lovin' me alright, until your dyin' day.  
Just say it a little bit louder now, I'm startin' to get in your groove, yeah.  
You've got nothing to worry about, your love is on the move.  
I hope some day the light of love shines bright upon your face.  
I don't care who you are, I love the human race.
