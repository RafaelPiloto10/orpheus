Left one in the drizzling rain  
Found one on the morning plane  
Leaving out his well-known line  
Bought her some gin - that did her in  
Now they're making love behind the occupied sign  
  
Chorus  
Just a living example of love in decline  
Looking so hard and so little time  
Going ninety to nothing and flying stone blind  
Just a living example of love in decline  
  
Miami hotel disco bar  
He asked if she's a movie star  
Her eyes light and up - they're going far  
No time for a room it happened to soon  
Now they're making love in her rental car  
Just a living example of love in decline
