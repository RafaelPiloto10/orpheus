So he told you you're the dream that he's been searching for  
And he told you that he'd never met anyone like you before  
And I can hear him telling you your lips taste just like sherry wine  
But did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time  
  
So he told you that he'd never lead your heart astray  
And he told you that he'd love you forever and a day  
And I can hear him telling you he's the shy and bashful kind  
But did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time  
  
Did he tell you that your heart will soon become  
Another trinket on his bracelets of broken hearts  
Did he tell you that the morning sun will find you  
Patching up your shattered pride and searching for the missing parts  
  
Did he tell you that the special love you're saving  
Will disappear in shame and flames like mine  
Did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time  
Did he tell you that your heart  
Did he tell you that your heart
