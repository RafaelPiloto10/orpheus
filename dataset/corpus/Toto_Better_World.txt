Hello my friends I'm calling to you  
The things we believed  
Are no longer true  
'Cause we're older now  
So much wiser than before  
  
The pain that we've felt  
We hold deep inside  
The dues we have paid  
And the tears we have cried  
And the emptiness  
Can we take it anymore  
  
Have we lost all our faith in our God  
And all that we are  
When we look at our lives  
What are we fighting for  
  
Whoa, let's make this a better world  
When push comes to shove  
What have we really learned  
Whoa, let's make this a better world  
When you're lying awake with your life in your head  
Thinking 'bout friends who are already dead  
We can change  
  
Whoa, let's make this a better world  
When push comes to shove  
What have we really learned  
Whoa, let's make this a better world  
Is there hope for us all  
As we're waiting to die  
Lying in bed as we take our last sigh
