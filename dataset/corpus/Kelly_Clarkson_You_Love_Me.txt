Thick skin, soft touch,  
Heart of gold but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
Forgiving arms, the higher road,  
Working hard but it's na-na-na-not enough,  
You say, I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
But what you really mean is, you're not good enough, you're not good enough  
You can't deliver  
So you turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You said you loved me but that I  
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough  
  
Stronghold, but fun ride,  
But roller coasters aren't just na-na-na-not enough,  
I keep it in, you wear me out,  
This kind of love is na-na-na-not enough,  
Said I'm just a sinking ship, I'm just a sinking ship,  
But what that really means, is you can't handle this, you can't handle this,  
You couldn't win so you turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love feels different it's like a blow to the head with your compliments.  
Your love hurts deeper  
It's like a brick in the sea and I'm drowning with it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So understand it means nothing when you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
When you say you love me  
You love me, you love me  
  
You didn't let me down,  
You didn't tear me apart  
You just opened my eyes,  
While breaking my heart  
You didn't do it for me  
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry  
While claiming that you love me  
You love me, you love me  
You know the truth is that  
You're not good enough, you're not good enough
