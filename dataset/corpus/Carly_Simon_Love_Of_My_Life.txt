I love lilacs and avocados  
Ukuleles and fireworks  
And Woody Allen and walking in the snow  
But you've got to know that  
  
You're the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
From the moment I first saw you  
The second that you were born  
I knew that you were the love of my life  
Quite simply the love of my life  
  
I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread  
The Statue Of Liberty and standing ovations  
And falling into bed  
But get it through your head that  
  
You're the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
You are the love of my life  
From the moment I first saw you  
The second that you were born  
I knew that you were the love of my life  
Quite simply the love of my life  
  
You an drive me crazy  
You can drive me anywhere  
Here are the keys  
Just do as you please  
It may not always be easy  
  
But you're the love of my life  
My heart is riding on a runaway train  
You are the love of my life  
Through all the pleasure and pain  
From the moment I first saw you  
I knew it right away  
I knew that you were the love of my life  
Simply the love of my life  
You are the love  
The great love of my life.
