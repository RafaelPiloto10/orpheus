So the factory girl, she listens  
For the sound of her daddy's engine  
Till the work bell sounds and she leans down  
oh, the summers here are hot  
All she seems to do is work and sleep  
And wish that she was still with you  
now you don't know where she is  
Lyin' in her mother's bed  
Or who she's sleeping with  
all the kids would laugh at her  
'cause she seemed so sweet and pure  
I took this shift because of her  
and though I've never said a word  
I once smiled and looked at her  
Till the shift boss said "get back to work"  
now I don't know where she is  
Or whose bed she's sleeping in  
Or what man she's sleeping with
