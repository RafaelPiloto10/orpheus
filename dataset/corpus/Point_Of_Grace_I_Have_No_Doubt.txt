Sometimes I don't know where I'm going  
Where the road is leading me  
Life can be full of so many changes  
So Many uncertainties  
  
But there's one thing that's constant in this heart of mine  
It's knowing that Your gonna love me, rain or shine  
  
[Chorus]  
I have no doubt  
That You will never leave me  
That You'll be there to keep me safe and warm  
I have no doubt  
No matter where You take me  
That nothing can separate me from You, Lord  
  
I don't know what You've planned for tomorrow  
Or what lies up ahead for me  
Pleasure, pain, worry, or sorrow  
Today is as far as I can see  
You may see fit to take me through the valey, Lord  
Or on the mountain.  
It makes no difference where I go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to run away  
From the voice that I hear calling  
But I'll be quick to answer and obey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing could ever separate me  
Nothing could ever separate me
