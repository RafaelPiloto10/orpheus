[Chorus]  
I'm just a passenger  
on this old freight train  
I ride the boxcar  
through the night  
I doesn't matter  
where I might get off  
I doesn't matter where I lie.  
  
I've been to cities,  
I've been to countries  
I've left a lover in many towns  
I don't care if  
I ever get back to  
Where I'd already been around.  
  
I'm like an eagle,  
I like to fly high  
I'm like a snake,  
I like to lay low  
I'm like a black man,  
I'm like a white man  
Maybe a red man, I don't know.  
  
[Chorus]
