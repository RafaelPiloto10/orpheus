Will you remember me baby?  
One day you should go away  
I know you say you'll always stay  
Oh, but life takes funny turns at times  
And has a way of changing minds  
No, I could never be your friend  
(Be your friend)  
To me the end would be the end  
But we've shared so much happiness  
Just remember, ohh baby  
(Remember)  
I know you tell me every day  
You'll love me till the end of time  
I tell it to you just in case  
Someday, you are no longer mine  
Just one thing I'll ask of you  
(One thing baby)  
'cause both of us have much to lose  
For all the things we've made it through  
Just remember, please, remember  
(Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon, oh)  
Remember me with love baby  
(Remember)  
Remember me with love  
(Don't you forget to remember)  
No matter where or when  
(Where or when)  
If you think of me again  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love baby  
(Will you remember me baby? Remember, will you remember?)  
Remember me with love  
(Will you remember me baby? Will you remember?)  
I know you care for me  
(Care for me)  
But if one day you set me free  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
(Do you remember me baby? Do you remember me?)  
Seems like everywhere I turn  
Somebody else is breakin' up  
I know as far as I'm concerned with you  
I'll always be in love  
But if one day you feel differently  
All you have to do, is come to me  
I will let you go so easily  
But remember, please, remember  
(Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon, oh)  
Remember me with love baby  
(Remember)  
Remember me with love, everyday  
(Don't you forget to remember)  
No matter where or when  
(Where or when)  
If you think of me again  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love baby  
(Will you remember me baby? Remember, will you remember?)  
Remember me with love  
(Will you remember me baby? Will you remember?)  
(Don't you forget, don't you forget)  
I know you care for me  
(Care for me)  
But if one day you set me free  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love  
(Remember me with love)
