Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side [Repeat: x 4]  
  
I know you want us both and I know the reason why.  
I can give you so much lovin ,  
But presents, she can buy you.  
Last night youre in my arms,  
Tonight Im all alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
How long will this game go on? How long?  
Oh, oh how long?  
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick.  
I know you got a chick on the side.  
  
And its plain, plain enough to see that  
You're not the man for me.  
I can't keep playin' games that keep my heart in pain.  
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do  
Than it is to say.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure.  
Ill get over you, yes Ill find someone new.  
Each time I open up my heart,  
It seems to just get torn apart.  
  
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick.  
I know you got a chick on the side. [Repeat: x 4]  
  
I saw you, don't you try to hide.  
Don't hide it from me, no, no. no. [Repeat several times]  
  
[Adlib line 2:]  
You thought you would hide it, hide it,  
Hide it from me.  
[Repeat several times]  
  
[Talking at the end]
