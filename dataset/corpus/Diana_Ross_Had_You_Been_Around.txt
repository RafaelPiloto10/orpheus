I might have known a lot of things  
Been smiled upon by kings and queens  
Had you been around  
  
Perhaps had you been by my side  
My dreams might not have been denied  
Had you been around  
  
I've wasted many years, tasted many tears  
And I want to know  
Lost on my own before I knew of you  
  
I might have heard a sigh  
Of someone passing by  
Had you been around  
  
And though it seems absurd  
I really never heard  
A sound  
  
Until that day you came my way  
With pleasure I never found  
It all might have been  
Had you been around  
  
Had you been around  
Perhaps had you been by my side  
My dreams might not have been denied  
Had you been around  
  
I've wasted many years, tasted many tears  
And I want to know  
I'm lost on my own before I knew of you  
  
I might have heard a sigh  
Of someone passing by  
Had you been around  
  
And though it seems absurd  
I really never heard  
A sound  
  
Until that day you came my way  
With pleasure I never found  
It all might have been  
Had you been around  
  
One more time, it all might have been  
Had you been around  
Do it again, it all might have been  
Had you been around  
  
Had you been around
