Try to swim, keep your head up  
Kick your legs, never give up, boy  
If I could I'd turn it around  
Let me out, I wanna get out now  
You know it gets so deep  
You know it  
  
You know it, you're feeling so deep  
But if you make it out, it tastes so sweet  
Sweet  
Sweet  
  
I'm so high, I wanna come down  
I'm so old to wanna be younger now  
If I could I'd turn it around  
Let me out, I wanna go home now  
  
You know the feeling, when you're in too deep  
And if you make it out, the taste so sweet  
Sweet  
Sweet  
  
Cover me, cover me, cover me  
Till I'm gone  
Cover me, cover me, cover me  
Till I'm gone  
Cover me, cover me, cover me  
Till I'm gone  
Gone  
  
You know the feeling, when you're in too deep  
And if you make it out, it tastes so sweet  
Sweet  
Sweet  
  
I miss, make it oh yeah
