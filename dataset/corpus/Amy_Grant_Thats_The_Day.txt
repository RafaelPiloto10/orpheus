There are burdens that I carry everyday  
Sometimes they make me want to cry  
Hopeless feelings harbored deep inside my heart  
And I find it hard to hold my head up high  
In the middle of the darkness in my life  
I find a strength to carry on  
I am holding to a promise Jesus made  
And I know it won't be long 'til we'll be gone  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
If you feel there is no meaning in your life  
And it seems you've lost your way  
Listen closely to the voice that's deep inside  
And remember what the Savior has to say  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
And that's the day that I am looking for
