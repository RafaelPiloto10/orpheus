Well a hello and a howdy  
We're so very glad to see you.  
And we're getting kinda rowdy  
And we've got a lot to say  
And we're going to try and do our very best to entertain you  
And we hope you'll be delighted by the time you go away  
And we are called by name, Oingo Boingo  
And we're here just to entertain you  
Make you laugh and maybe offened you  
But we hope that you, will be happier than when you came because  
It is more fun. Just relax, prepare to come undone.  
Madness in large portions to serve you  
Second helpings come wih mashed potatoes.  
Wylee, weelie, wylee wailee (???) We are called the Oingo Boingo  
Not Gazingo, or Gazongo or by any other name  
And we'll punch you in the gizzard if you dare to call us Bingo  
Cause we're called the Oingo Boingo  
And it's simply not the same.  
No it's simply not the same
