I gave up pimento cheese  
Domino's delivery  
Whiskey sours  
Apple pies  
Finger-lickin' chicken fried  
Are gastronomic history  
I used to like them scary shows  
But I gave 'em up a while ago  
Don't do no dip-defyin'  
Roller coaster ridin'  
Nowadays, I just take it slow  
Every since we started datin'  
I been compensatin'  
To keep from gettin' up  
To hell any quicker  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
She's hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
The girl is such a hazard that she ought to have a sticker  
Sayin' hard on the ticker  
  
Now, when she wiggles through my door  
My chin gets heavy, hits the floor  
Silky hair, garnet lips  
Swingin' double-jointed hips  
My blood begins to roar  
And when she nibbles on me ear  
It's partly pleasure, partly beer  
Little dab is all it takes  
To get my heart a palpatatin'  
Feelin' like the end is near  
I ought to get a policy  
A double indemnity  
It'd make my beneficiary  
A whole lot richer  
'Cause...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's my girl  
Yeah, she's hard on the ticker  
I ought to get a policy  
A double indemnity  
It'd make my beneficiary  
A whole lot richer  
  
Because she's hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
The girl is such a hazard that she ought to have a sticker  
Sayin' hard on the ticker  
  
Oh, she's hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
She's hard on the ticker  
Hey, she's hard on the ticker
