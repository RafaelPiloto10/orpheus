[Thenardier assembling his gang.]  
  
Thenardier  
Everyone here, you know your place  
Brujon, Babet, Claqusous  
You, Montparnasse, watch for the law  
With Eponine, take care.  
You turn on the tears  
No mistakes, my dears  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
These bloody students on our street  
Here they come slumming once again  
Our Eponine would kiss their feet  
She never had a scrap of brain  
  
Marius  
Eponine, what's up today?  
I haven't seen you much about.  
  
Eponine  
Here, you can always catch me in.  
  
Marius  
Mind the police don't catch you out!  
  
Eponine  
Here, whatcher doing with all them books?  
I could have been a student too!  
Don't judge a girl on how she looks...  
I know a lot of things I do!  
  
Marius  
Poor Eponine, the things you know  
You wouldn't find in books like these.  
  
Eponine  
I like the way you grow your hair  
  
Marius  
I like the way you always tease  
  
Eponine  
Little he knows!  
Little he sees!  
  
[Valjean arrives with Cosette, now grown up.]  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Here's the old boy. Stay on the job and watch out for  
The law.  
  
Eponine  
[to Marius] Stay out of this.  
  
Marius  
But Eponine...  
  
Eponine  
You'll be in trouble here  
It's not your concern  
You'll be in the clear  
  
[She pushes Marius away.]  
  
Marius  
Who is that man?  
  
Eponine  
Leave me alone!  
  
Marius  
Why is he here? Hey, Eponine!  
  
[He begins to follow her, and bumps into Cosette.]  
  
I didn't see you there, forgive me.  
  
Thenardier  
Please M'sieur, come this way  
Here's a child that ain't eaten today.  
Save a life, spare a sou  
God rewards all the good that you do.  
Wait a bit. Know that face.  
Ain't the world a remarkable place?  
Men like me don't forget  
You're the bastard that borrowed Cosette!  
  
[Thenardier grabs Valjean and rips open his shirt, revealing the number on his
chest.]  
  
Valjean  
What is this? Are you mad?  
No, Monsieur, you don't know what you do!  
  
Thenardier  
You know me, you know me.  
I'm a con, just like you.  
  
Eponine  
It's the police! Disappear!  
Run for it! It's Javert!
