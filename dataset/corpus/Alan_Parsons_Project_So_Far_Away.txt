We say welcome to the mission  
Show us all what you can do  
We need a man with vision  
So we put our trust in you  
And now we hope sincerely  
That you'll do the best that you can do  
  
Oh for sure it won't be easy  
And we will have to risk our lives  
Some will try to break us  
And cut us down to size  
But jsut remember  
There can be no consolation prize  
Not in our eyes  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
Can you hear what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
Although time is getting short  
There's still some sand left in the glass  
And now we have a living breathing  
Rocket man at last  
It's time to take a step  
And nail our colours to the mast  
  
No more talk of great adventures  
When it's movement that we need  
It must be our intention  
That we never loose the lead  
So count us down to zero  
And let's get up to speed  
We're up and away  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
So believe what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
And so now they cry for justice  
As if justice will be done  
But the eye up in the sky  
Was flying to close to the sun  
The challenger has fallen  
And the race has now been run....
