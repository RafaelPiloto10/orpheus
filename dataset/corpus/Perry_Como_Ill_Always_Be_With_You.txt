I'll be with you in everything I do  
in drifting clouds, in passing crowds, there's you  
I see your eyes, in blue and starry skies  
your laughter sings, the memory clings a new  
  
My darling, you're so very much a part of me  
I close my eyes and feel you in the heart of me, honestly  
There is no night can hide you from my sight  
in dreams, you see, I'll always be, with you!  
  
  
  
My darling, you're so very much a part of me  
I close my eyes and seed you in the heart of me, honestly  
There is no night can hide you from my sight  
in dreams, you see, I'll always be, with you!
