In the blackness of the night  
I seem to wander endlessly  
With a hope burning out deep inside  
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out  
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt  
I'm alone and there is no one by my side  
  
In the blackness of the night  
I see a shadow passing by  
From the heels of an old soldier boy.  
There's no comprimising  
And his eyes are black as the sky  
For this bad, bad world he is going to die.  
He's alone and there is no one by his side  
  
In the blackness of the night  
I see a sparkle of a star  
From the sweet silver tear of a child  
And she's clutching at a photograph of long, long ago  
When her parents were happy she was too young to know  
She's alone and there is no one by her side  
  
I'm alone and there is no one by my side  
In the blackness of the night  
I seem to wander endlessly  
With a hope burning out deep inside  
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out  
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt  
I'm alone, and there is no one by my side
