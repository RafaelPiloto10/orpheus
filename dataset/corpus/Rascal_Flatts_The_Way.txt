Think about the way the earth revolves around the sun  
Gravity holds it all in place and keeps it all from coming undone  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you  
Think about how a baby cries to feel his mother's touch  
And how he finally rest so peacefully when she finally picks him up  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you  
Oh they say the sky the limit, but I say there is so much more  
Because your love takes me higher than I've ever been before  
Where the heavens hold the stars that why they stay where they are  
I know why they shine the way the do  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you  
Just like a solider fights for what he knows is right  
He gladly gives his last breathe of freedom and he wouldn't even think twice  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you.  
Oh they say the sky the limit, but I say there is so much more  
Because your love takes me higher than I've ever been before  
Where the heavens hold the stars that why they stay where they are  
I know why they shine the way the do  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you  
Oh I may not be a wise man but I know one things is true  
That the reefs only reason is to find the ocean blue  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you  
(That's the way I feel about you)  
That's the way, that's the way I feel about you
