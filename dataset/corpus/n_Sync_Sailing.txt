Well it's not far down to paradise  
At least it's not for me  
And if the wind is right you can sail away  
And find tranquility  
Oh, the canvas can do miracles  
Just you wait and see  
Baby believe me, oh  
  
It's not far to Never Never Land  
No reason to pretend  
And if the wind is right you can find the joy  
Of innocence again  
Oh, the canvas can do miracles  
Just you wait and see  
Baby believe me, oh  
  
Sailing (takes me away)  
Takes me away  
To where I've always heard it could be  
(I heard it could be)  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
(Soon I will be free)  
Soon I will be free, yeah  
  
Fantasy, it gets the best of me  
When I'm sailing, sailing  
All the world in a reverie  
Every word is a symphony  
Won't you believe me, oh  
  
Sailing (takes me away)  
(Takes me away)  
Takes me away to where I want to be  
(To where I've always heard it could be)  
(I heard it could be)  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
(Soon I will be free)  
Soon I will be free  
  
Well it's not far back to sanity  
At least it's not for me  
And if the wind is right you can sail away  
And find serenity  
Oh, the canvas can do miracles  
Just you wait and see  
Baby believe me, oh  
  
Sailing (takes me away)  
Takes me away  
(To where I've always heard it could be)  
I heard it could be  
(Heard it could be)  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
(Soon I will be free)  
Soon I will be free, free  
  
(Sailing takes me away)  
(To where I've always heard it could be)  
I heard it could be  
(I heard it could be)  
Just a dream and a wind to carry me  
(Soon I will be free)  
Soon I will be free, yeah
