I was so young when I was born  
My eyes could not yet see  
And by the time of my first dawn  
Somebody holding me they said  
  
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace  
We've been expecting you  
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace  
No matter where you roam know our love is true  
  
While growing up or trying to  
Not knowing where to start  
I looked around for someone who  
May help reveal my heart someone said  
  
While you're a part of Cracerbox Palace  
Do what the rest all do  
Or face the fact that Crackerbox Palace  
May have no other choice than to deport you  
  
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace  
We've been expecting you  
You bring us joy in Crackerbox Palace  
No matter where you roam know our love is true  
  
Sometimes are good sometimes are bad  
That's all a part of life  
And standing in between them all  
I met a Mr. Grief - and he said  
  
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace  
Was not expecting you  
Let's rap and tap at Crackerbox Palace  
Know that the Lord is well and inside of you
