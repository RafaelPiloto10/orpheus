[Chorus]  
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  
Never let it fade away  
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night  
Just in case you feel you want to hold her  
You'll have a pocketful of starlight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night  
Just in case you feel you want to hold her  
You'll have a pocketful of starlight  
(Pocketful of starlight, hm,hm,hm,hm,hm,hm)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Save it for a rainy, save it for a rainy, rainy, rainy, day)  
  
For when your troubles start multiplyin' and they just might  
It's easy to forget them without tryin'  
With just a pocketful of starlight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Save it for a rainy day)  
Save it for a rainy day
