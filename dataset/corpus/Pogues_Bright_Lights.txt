The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
As the world is round, road is long  
Trouble on my mind  
I'll just keep on moving  
Till the day comes 'round  
Wind a' blowing on my back  
And my feet a' flying  
Flying down the road  
Where the bright lights shine  
Monday's in a pigtown  
Tuesday's in a truck  
Wednesday's a field of mud  
And Thursday's out of luck  
Friday's rain clouds  
Saturday flies by  
Sunday comes shining  
From a blue, blue sky  
The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
Some towns are golden  
Some towns are stained  
Some towns are shadows  
Fading in the rain  
Some towns are rust  
And some towns they gleam  
Some towns are mad dogs  
Some towns are a dream  
The bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
Some dreams are hollow  
Some dreams are cold  
Some dreams are crazy  
And some dreams are bold  
Some dreams are bought  
And other dreams are sold  
Some dreams lie waiting  
At the end of the road  
Where the bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me  
I said the bright lights are calling me  
The bright lights are calling me  
When the world is dark and cold  
And I'm heading down the road  
The bright lights are calling me
