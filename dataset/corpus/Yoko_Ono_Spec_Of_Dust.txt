In the middle of the night,  
I'm lying in your bed.  
Thinking of you and me in the universe.  
  
Stars are moving like the night we met,  
The earth is turning like the time we said.  
In my mind I'm searching for you, billion miles away.  
  
Why do I miss you so if you're just a spec of dust,  
Floating endlessly amongst the billion stars?  
  
Knowing that one day we may float apart,  
Meeting each other in memories.  
  
Why do I love you so if you're just a spec of dust,  
Floating endlessly amongst the trillion stars?  
Knowing that one day we may float apart,  
Meeting each other in universe.
