Farewell, my love.  
Farewell, my love.  
  
I love you more than anything.  
No one knows the good you bring  
Eddie: to me.  
  
But I've got to set you free. (Boo oh)  
I've just got to set you free. (Boo oh)  
  
Aw, goodbye, (goodbye) my love. (My love)  
I'm gonna cry, (gonna cry) my love. (My love)  
  
The vow of love you broken.  
The law of love has spoken  
to you.  
  
Oh, why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)  
Why couldn't you be true? (Why couldn't you be true?)  
  
So long, baby.  
You know, it's so hard  
It's really hard to find someone in this wide world, who's really true.  
I guess it's just meant for me to be unhappy.  
But I believe, I really do believe that somewhere someone is waiting for me.  
  
Aw, she's there, (she's there) my love. (My love)  
Somewhere, (somewhere) my love. (My love)  
  
Someone who cares.  
And still be there  
Eddie: with me.  
  
Oh, my darling can't you see? (Boo oh)  
How wonderful it would be, yeah. (Boo oh)  
  
Farewell, to you.  
Farewell, my love.  
We're  
Through.  
We're through.
