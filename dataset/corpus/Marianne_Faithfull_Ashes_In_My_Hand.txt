It took a long time coming  
That big over the shoulder statement  
But when it came, it flowed easy as poison  
Taken in extreme despair [Repeat: x3]  
  
Remember to write often  
In case you have something to tell me,  
But please don't mention the unexpected guest  
Staring into empty eyes [Repeat: x3]  
  
A long lost confidence and pride  
Come ringing back, come ringing back  
To have the shadow back again  
And happiness that feels like pain.  
  
Then you left us  
To see if you could find it  
And when you came back, it flowed easy as poison  
It flowed easy as poison  
Taken in extreme despair [Repeat: x3]  
  
A long lost confidence and pride  
Come ringing back, come ringing back  
To have the shadow back again  
And happiness that feels like pain [Repeat: x2]  
  
Happiness that feels like pain. [Repeats]
