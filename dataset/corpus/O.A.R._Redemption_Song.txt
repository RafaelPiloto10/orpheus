Old pirates yes they rob I  
Sold I to the merchant ships  
Minutes after they took I  
From the bottomless pits  
But my hand was made strong  
By the hand of the all-mighty  
We forward in this generation, triumphantly  
Won't you help to sing  
These songs of freedom  
Cause all I ever had, redemption songs  
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery  
None but ourselves can free our minds  
Have no fear for atomic energy  
Cause none of them can stop the time  
How long shall they killed our prophets  
While we stand aside and look  
Some say it's just a part of it  
We've got to fulfill the book  
Wont you help to sing  
These songs of freedom  
Cause all I ever had, redemption songs  
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery  
None but ourselves can free our minds  
Oh, have no fear for atomic energy  
Cause none of them can stop the time  
How long shall they kill our prophets  
While we stand aside and look  
Oh, some say it's just a part of it  
We've got to fulfill the book  
Wont you help to sing  
Another song of freedom man  
Cause all I ever had, redemption songs  
These songs of freedom  
These songs of freedom  
All I ever had
