We are a generation twisted by our myth  
Confused and ludicrous, holding on to love  
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst  
A life without the lips we've kissed  
And losing all control  
  
We're gonna start a resistance  
So we want independence  
We're gonna give the world some of this  
  
Electric kiss  
I'm gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice forever  
We'll live together  
Peace, love, solitude and happiness  
Electric kiss  
  
Fame is our felony  
We're so in love with it  
Superstars and masochists  
Who don't know where to go  
But the poets and the fathers of our time  
Put down their weapons in their arms  
And know what they must do  
  
We're gonna start a resistance  
So we want independence  
We're gonna give the world some of this  
  
Electric kiss  
I'm gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice forever  
We'll live together  
Peace, love, solitude and happiness  
  
Electric kiss  
I'm gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice for ever  
We'll live together  
Peace, love, solitude and happiness  
Electric kiss
