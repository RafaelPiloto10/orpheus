I do not know why I would go  
In front of you and hide my soul  
'Cause you're the only one who knows it,  
Yeah you're the only one who knows it  
  
And I will hide behind my pride  
Don't know why I think I can lie  
'Cause there's a screen on my chest  
Yeah there's a screen on my chest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm trying to be so cool  
Everything together trying to be so cool  
  
I can't see past my own nose, I'm seeing everything in slo-mo  
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive  
That's a train, am I painting the picture that's in my brain?  
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane  
My flow's not great, okay, I conversate with people  
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play  
While you're doing fine, there's some people and I  
Who have a really tough time getting through this life  
So excuse us while we sing to the sky.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat x3]  
We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken people, oh.  
We're broken people, oh.  
  
[Repeat x2]  
(We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken people, oh.  
We're broken people, oh.)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm trying to be so cool  
Everything together trying to be so cool
