G shit, LBC shit, remember how it used to be?  
Mmm, you remember so much  
No we didn't, see if you can remember this shit  
1982 now what was I to do  
  
All I want to do ic claim RTC  
'Cause all of my homies from ICG  
So we goin' do this thang for tha LBC  
'Cause we all one love and yeah this the dub  
  
On my eleven gettin' slicker  
Buyin liquor from a non-liquor store  
Quick to dick a hoe and get that big homie for a 64  
He ain't goin' miss it though  
  
'Cause I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone  
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome  
Now he's tryin' to take my dome  
Hangin' out all in front of my home  
  
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own  
Now it's really on  
'Cause I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit  
Put that switches on his riches  
  
Now his bitch is my bitch  
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip  
But I won't hesitate to test another rip  
See that's the plan I was brainwashed not to know  
  
But nigga fuck what you goin' through this 2-0  
And by that time I'm 17 if I ain't in that pin  
I'm on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin' again  
Ridin', hoo-bangin' like Mack 10  
  
Back on tha streets again and strapped in  
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up  
Nigga I don't give a fuck, nigga I don't give a fuck em  
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang  
It's all fair in tha gang bang  
  
I feel like livin' it up  
I mean will like livin' it up, you know  
Bang to that boogie and boogie to that bang  
That sound of mi Nina when she feel that need to sang  
  
I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now  
Not to mention that homeboys locked down in tha p now  
See now that road get shaky but you can't break  
Watch out for them hood rats, snakes  
  
'Cause E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt  
The lil' homie did too much dirt and got worked  
Now he's on the run and dyin' of thirst  
Stayin' at his girls spot on 21st  
  
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst  
'Cause he might not make it to tha last verse  
But meanwhile back in tha p now  
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style  
  
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes  
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep  
We straight bangin  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
This is Dogg Pound for life  
This is Dogg Pound for life, yeah right  
What you join tha game for you lil busta  
Now you want to cross us out and disrespect us  
  
Must of thought we was bustas or somethin'  
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas  
That's that one thang I learned about tha gang bang  
If you goin' gang bang  
  
Ya gots to be able to bang like yourself man  
So whether you bangin' for crip or blood  
You better bang for somthin' young thug  
'Cause you'll get banged on not by bangas  
  
But by Johnny Law 'cause they love to hang us I hear ya  
I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border  
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter  
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch  
  
I can't trip 'cause she look like my daughter and shit  
So I'm a load up my clip and go ridin high  
And every police car that I see ridin by  
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid  
  
Drinkin' to that set and hope my dog young have head  
Throwin' up DPG for L-I-F-E 'cause that's all I see  
Wit love for the LB  
  
[Chorus]
