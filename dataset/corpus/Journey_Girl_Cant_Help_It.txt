If he could hold her, so close in his arms...again  
If she could show him  
The letter her heart forgot to send...why  
They're livin' dreams on their own  
Ooh they'll never stop running  
  
The girl can't help it, she needs more  
He hasn't found what he's lookin' for  
They're still standing in the rain  
He can't help it, and she's just that way  
  
And when he calls her  
She tells him that she still cares  
Under the moonlight,  
He wonders why she can't be there...why  
Why do they go on alone  
When they're missin' each other  
  
The girl can't help it, she needs more  
He hasn't found what he's lookin' for  
They're still standing in the rain  
He can't help it, and she's just that way  
  
The girl can't help it, she needs more  
He hasn't found what he's lookin' for  
They're still standing in the rain  
He can't help it, and she's just that way  
  
There's a fire  
Ooh there's a fire in his eyes for you  
Don't you know she still cries  
Ooh do you know she still cries for you  
Fire  
Ooh there's a fire in his eyes for you  
For you she cries  
Ooh do you know she still cries for you  
Fire  
Ooh there's a fire in his eyes for you  
Ooh nothing stands between love and you
