She's my inspiration lady,  
Inspiration everywhere  
She's my inspiration lady,  
She lights candles in the air  
In the warmth of a morning sun  
And at night when the day is done  
She's my inspiration lady,  
My anticipation lady  
She's my situation every day  
  
Seems like every time I see her,  
She's got something on her mind  
When she tells the age old story,  
Of a life she left behind  
In the warmth of the morning light,  
She will turn and hold me tight  
She's my inspiration lady,  
Soft, sad situation lady  
She's my situation every day  
  
Seems like I will always love her,  
Inspiration every day  
And I like to think, hey maybe,  
I can drive her blues away  
In the warmth of the morning sun,  
And at night when the day is done  
She's my inspiration lady,  
She's my kind reaction lady  
She's my situation every day  
She's my inspiration lady,  
My anticipation lady  
She's my inspiration all the way
