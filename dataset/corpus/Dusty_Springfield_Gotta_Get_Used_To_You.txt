Who d'you think you're kidding?  
You walk out on my life  
Now, you're back again  
And you think that nothing's changed  
Denying superstitions, defying traditions  
It seems like we've been through this before  
Now, it's gonna be like starting all over again  
Oh, baby, don't you know?  
It's gonna be like starting all over again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
You know I love to feel you  
Reach the depth of my heart  
Deep inside of me  
The way it used to do  
I've had so many lovers  
No-one could ever tame me  
They all seem to rub me the wrong way  
They always get my back up  
No-one seems to do the things that you do for me  
And now that you're back in my life again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again
