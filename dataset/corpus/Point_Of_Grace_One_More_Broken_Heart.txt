I see people merely existing  
I see vacant eyes full of pain  
Lives broken and abused, yeah  
Hiding hearts scarred and stained  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
Could it be that I could make a difference?  
If I care the way You care for me  
When they look into my eyes  
Let it be Your eyes they see  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
Let me show them that You love them  
Won't You help me bring them in?  
Lord, I promise You again  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart
