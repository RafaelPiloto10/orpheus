(Dolly Parton)  
When I look at you  
I melt like a candle  
You light a fire in me  
What am I to do  
I just hope I can handle  
The heat and the smoke blinding me  
This feeling, this fire  
This burning desire  
Is raging its way through my soul  
And if you feel the same  
Help me fan the flames  
'Til we're burning out of control  
Burning to know you  
Burning to show you  
And I've felt this way from the start  
Burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting  
And it's burning a hole in my heart  
You kindle in me  
A warm glowing feeling  
A spark and a flicker of hope  
It's more than a game  
And like moths to a flame  
We're drawn to its warmth and its glow  
These embers of love  
Are fueled by the notion  
This could be an eternal flame  
Consumed by the blaze  
I fear it's too late  
'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name  
Oh, and I'm burning to know you  
Burning to hold you  
It's grown to a flame from a spark  
Burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting  
And it's burning a hole in my heart  
Oh, I'm burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting...  
I've had so many dreams fall apart...  
And it's burning a hole in my heart...  
I'm burning  
Oh, I'm burning  
Mmmm, I'm burning oh, I burning ooh
