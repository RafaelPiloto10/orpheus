Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin'  
  
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep  
You'll cry and cry, you gonna try to sleep  
But sleep won't come the whole night through  
Your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You gonna toss around, you gonna call my name  
You gonna walk the floor just the way I do  
Your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you  
  
Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin'  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You gonna toss around, you gonna call my name  
You gonna walk the floor just the way I do  
(You walk the floor the way I do)  
Your cheatin' heart is gonna tell on you  
(Your cheatin' heart, your cheatin' heart tells on you)
