Another hungry look in her eyes again  
Pacing the floor  
The hunt begins  
Skin-tight leather provides my pleasure  
Wake my fear, surge wit the pressure  
Walk away and leave forever, do I dare?  
  
Raise my eyes, she stands  
Holding out healing hands...are you happy now?  
  
I walk the thin line for you  
Do just what you say to  
With fear as my friend  
I walk the thin line one more time for you  
  
Addictive face pretending, don't speak the word  
Forbidden sin relenting, I barely heard...  
Screams of entry blur my vision  
Wake my fear of divine intervention  
Crawl away and bleed forever, if you dare  
  
Hand on mouth the game goes on  
Love, our stage to play upon  
Are you happy now?  
  
I walk the thin line for you  
Do just what you say to  
With fear as my friend  
I walk the thin line one more time for you  
  
I walk the thin line for you.  
Do just what you say to.  
I walk the thin line for you.  
Do just what you say to,  
With fear as my friend,  
I walk the thin line one more time for you.
