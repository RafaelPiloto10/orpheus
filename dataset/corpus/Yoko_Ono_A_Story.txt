There was a girl who couldn't speak,  
Who couldn't speak her mind.  
Only thing she was good at  
Was telling stories of faraway lands.  
  
There was a guy who couldn't say,  
Who couldn't say what he wanted.  
Only thing he was good at  
Was cracking jokes to make people laugh.  
  
So many words he swallowed,  
So many thoughts she kept to herself.  
And when they met they made love  
And talked about the world and the weather.  
  
So many cities he walked,  
So many countries she traveled.  
And in their dreams they would listen  
To the sound of the sea they heard together.
