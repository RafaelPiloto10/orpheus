Uh, my head is like a shark's fin  
  
Chorus:  
(we're in) deepest, bluest, my head is like a shark's fin,  
(the deep) deepest, bluest, my head is like a shark's fin,  
(blue sea) deepest, bluest, my head is like a shark's fin,  
(ah, ah) deepest, bluest, my head is like a shark's fin,  
  
Man-made terror  
Hungry jaws of death  
Y'all don't cross my depths  
I'll pause your breaths  
I cause you to sink down forty thousand leagues  
Bleeding to death with no arms in short sleeves  
My world's deep blue  
Killers gotta eat too  
Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through  
Other fish in the sea but barracudas ain't equal  
To a half human predator created by a needle  
Jet black eyes baby they stare while you sleep  
When your titanic sink I'm the one you gon' meet  
Hearing terrified screams they surround my team  
All you see is trails of blood  
Even god won't intervene  
Nightmares of darkness  
My appetite is heartless  
Even if we related, you eliminated regardless  
In the deep blue, underwater wars  
Half man, half shark  
My jaws don't pause  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Our father who art in heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Killers sworn to beast  
Swallowed them in flames  
Switch my dna  
Flip me into cool j  
I can't fight the feelin'  
I'm born to kill prey  
To survive an attack  
There's only one way  
Battle to the death  
That's how sharks play  
Weapons left behind  
We dueling with the mind  
You blind, crippled, or crazy  
You're real easy to find  
Struggling to float  
With heomorhages in your throat  
Getting the lap dance  
While I smash through your boat  
Eat your whole fam'  
Nothing left but da right hand  
Clinging to a rail  
Escape attempts fail  
You'll never make it home  
Tear the flesh off your bone  
Walking in undercurrents is a dangerous zone  
I'm talking death out a moment's notice  
You wasn't focused  
Me and my crew strike  
Like some underwater locust  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
Uh, uh take it deeper  
  
These waters are waist level  
The hallway's flooded  
Lost your scuba gear  
The killer's cold-blooded  
His name's ll  
You don't really want it  
I ate your ancestors  
The ocean is haunted  
I'm closing in cause I'm supposed to win  
How the cold steel feel when it froze your chin  
Should of stayed on dry land  
Stroke while you can  
Cause now you under pressure in the land of the damned  
Abandoned pirate ships  
Eels and sod scum  
Fish that glow in the dark  
The titanic's hub  
Underwater storms  
You're blood is so warm  
You're life vest is off  
And that turns me on  
Killer for centuries  
The gotti of the deep  
In the next millennium  
I'm still gonna creep  
Sand under my belly, ocean over my head  
Through the light in the shadows  
You become the living dead  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yeah, dbs
