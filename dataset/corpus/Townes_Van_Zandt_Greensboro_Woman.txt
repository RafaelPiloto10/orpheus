Greensboro woman don't you smile on me  
I do not feel like being comforted  
and anyway I'll be home soon  
for once is someone waitin' there  
and if you don't mind  
I just think on her instead  
  
Your face, she's a picture, babe  
pictures ain't what I crave  
I don't feel this way most generally  
I just pit a thousand miles 'tween me  
and where my thoughts do lie  
and I thank you kindly baby to kindly let me be  
  
Your car, she's smooth and fast  
babe, your bourbon's fine  
but I ain't feelin free and clear today  
Texas loving laying on my mind  
I couldn't do you right babe spinnin' round this way  
  
Greensboro woman don't you smile on me  
I do not feel like being comforted  
and anyway I'll be home soon  
for once is someone waitin' there  
and if you don't mind  
I just think on her instead
