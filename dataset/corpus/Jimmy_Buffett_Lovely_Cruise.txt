Drink it up  
This ones for you  
It's been a lovely cruise  
I'm sorry it's ended  
It's sad but it's true  
Honey it's been a lovely cruise  
  
These moments were left with  
May you always remember  
These moments are shared by few  
There's wind in our hair  
And there's water in our shoes  
Honey, it's been a lovely cruise  
  
These moments we're left with  
May you always remember  
These moments are shared by few  
And those harbor lights  
Aw they're coming into view  
We bid our farwell much too soon  
So drink it up  
This one's for you  
Honey, it's been a lovely cruise  
Yea baby, it's been a lovely cruise  
Oh darlin' it's been a lovely cruise
