Please don't ask me who, who you think I am  
I could live without that, I'm just a modest man  
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do  
'Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now  
I'm guessing we're through now,  
Proceeding into the forest I will lay around and wait  
And I'll wait for you  
  
Please don't ask me where, where you think I've been  
I've been a lot of places but this could be my win  
Meet me at the corner where I'll, tell me what to do  
'Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now  
I'm guessing we're through now,  
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait  
And I'll wait for you  
  
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know  
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know  
Something I wanna show, I thought you'd wanna know  
  
Please don't say you want to keep in touch  
I bare to see you on the corner that I just can't bare  
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do  
'Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now  
I'm guessing we're through now  
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait  
  
And I turn, I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the Gods  
A sign from the gods that you were meant to be mine  
And it's fine, taking it all for a ride til the day when it's gone  
I mystified my way and it all went wrong when it's gone  
I live and I learn and I lose and I win, but it's better whenever  
Whenever I'm here, thank you girl for everywhere that we've been
