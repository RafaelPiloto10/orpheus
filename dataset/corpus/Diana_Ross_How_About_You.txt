If you really think I'm fine  
Then why don't you just take the time  
And call me  
Baby, hurry, come see me  
Friends all say you speak my name  
Well, let me say  
I feel the same about you  
Can't do without you  
How about you?  
Hey! Baby, what's wrong?  
You look so surprised  
I can tell by the look in your eyes  
That you need me  
And I need you too  
Hey, baby what's wrong  
You know you need me  
And I need you too  
How about you?  
I know all the words  
That I want to say  
But if I do will you walk away  
And leave me here  
By myself with my tears  
Baby I still have my pride  
Even though it's not enough to hide  
My love for you  
Baby, I love you  
How about you?  
Baby, how about you  
Do you need me too  
Baby, how about you  
Do you need me too  
Baby, how about you
