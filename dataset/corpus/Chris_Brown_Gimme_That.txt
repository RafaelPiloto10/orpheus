Storch (oh)  
S Dot (Yea)  
  
Ooh Ohh  
  
The dynamic duo  
  
Wow womp womp wompit's what your body sayin'  
Chris Brown is in the building  
  
The young boy just turned sixteen  
And I got six fours and hot bikes that I rock  
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock,  
But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him  
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,  
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk  
That sassy tempo with that walk,  
Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (gimme that)  
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)  
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,  
You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)  
  
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you,  
What ya body got a young boy ready to do  
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you,  
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school  
I'm a hustler! Trust my frame and age  
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page  
I can picture us switching lanes in the coupe  
With you on the phone screaming my name  
  
(Chris)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp  
Girl you serious and I been watching you  
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp  
This's what your body's saying  
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp (yeahhhhh)  
Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp, womp, Wo-womp
