Popeye's big punch knocks pluto cold  
Cartoon people don't go old  
Yosemite sam blows up his head  
But you and me wind up dead  
Dreamed I laid a toaster  
Daddy caught me in the act  
Can you take it?  
Beauty queens get bigger all the time  
Mamma is in a basket, crossed a double  
Yellow line  
Magazines and t.v. show us nice behinds  
All the kind of stuff nobody ever finds  
Headlines in the paper "killed by rock n' roll"  
Can you take it?
