It was New Cross Station, I was going on home  
Saw you get your ticket, standing on your own  
Here come the train about 02:44  
I couldn't get a smoker, you took another car  
  
Yeah, the end of the line, we both had to change,  
And you're standing right behind me,  
I'm a feeling kinda strange  
We got to Mile End Road, my heart skipped a beat,  
Standing right behind me, I'm a shakin' in my seat  
3-4 minutes and the train comes through,  
I'm ridin' on the Central, I'm a-lookin' at you.  
  
Woman on the eastbound train,  
Sometimes I wanna see you again.  
  
Now I couldn't read a paper, you couldn't read a book,  
Kept on taking me another look,  
You got off the train, you never looked behind  
I tried, but I can't get you out of my mind.  
  
Woman on the eastbound train,  
Sometimes I wanna see you again.  
  
Well I got one more thing I wanna say before I go  
If you get the message on the radio  
You can write a letter, get in touch with me,  
Leave your number with the company, yeah.  
  
Woman on the eastbound train,  
Sometimes I wanna see you again.
