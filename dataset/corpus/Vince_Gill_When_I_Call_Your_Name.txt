I rushed home from work like I always do  
I spent my whole day just thinking of you  
When I walked through the front door my whole like was changed  
Cause nobody answered when I called your name  
  
A note on the table that told me goodbye  
It said you'd grown weary of living a lie  
Your love has ended but mine still remains  
But nobody answers when I call your name  
  
Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling  
Is driving me insane  
And just like rain the tears keep falling  
Nobody answers when I call your name  
  
Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling  
Is driving me insane  
And just like rain the tears keep falling  
Nobody answers when I call your name  
Oh nobody answers when I call your name
