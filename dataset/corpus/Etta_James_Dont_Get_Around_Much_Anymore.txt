Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you, daddy  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess  
My mind's more at ease  
But never, never, nevertheless  
Why stir up memories?  
  
Been invited on dates  
I might have gone but what for?  
It's awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
And ohh, darling, darling, darling, I guess  
My mind is more at ease  
But never, never, nevertheless  
Ohh, why stir up memories?  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for?  
It's always awfully different without you, daddy  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Don't get around much anymore  
Don't get around much anymore
