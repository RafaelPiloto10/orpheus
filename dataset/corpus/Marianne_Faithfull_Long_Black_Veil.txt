Ten years ago on a cold dark night,  
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light.  
There were few at the scene but they all did agree  
That the man who ran looked a lot like me.  
  
[Chorus]  
She walks these hills in a long black veil.  
She visits my grave where the night winds wail.  
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees,  
Nobody knows but me.  
  
The judge said, "Son what is your alibi ?  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die."  
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,  
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The scaffold is high and eternity nears  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear.  
But sometimes at night where the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries all o'er my bones.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody knows but me.
