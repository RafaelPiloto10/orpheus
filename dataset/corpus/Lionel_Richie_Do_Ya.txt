She was all that I could ask for  
I could see it in her eyes, And her smile told me  
That I was on her mind, And you should have seen the way  
That she looked at me across the room  
I could see her thinking, man that boy is fine  
  
[Chorus]  
Do ya know she's tryin' to fool ya  
I know what she's doin' to ya, She loves me more than you  
Ya, ya know she wants me, Do ya think I'd lose her to ya  
But you don't get that, do ya  
You know she's nothing to ya, She wants me  
  
So what makes you think a girl like her could fall in love with you  
When a guy like me has everything she needs  
Well, I don't believe you understand, The power of my game  
You just got to know that girl is into me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't care how much you say, You think about my girl, about my girl  
But I'm telling you I know she's feeling me  
You just might wanna think twice  
About messin' with my girl, with my girl  
She's my girl, she's my girl, And I know she want me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She wants me, She wants me, And I know that she wants me  
  
[Chorus]
