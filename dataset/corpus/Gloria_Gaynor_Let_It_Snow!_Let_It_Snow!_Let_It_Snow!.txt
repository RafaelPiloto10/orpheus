Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
Since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
He doesn't care if it's in below  
He's sitting by the fires glossy glow  
He don't care about the cold  
And the winds that blow  
He just says, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Ooh, wee, goes the storm  
Why should he worry  
When he's nice and warm?  
His girl by his side  
And the lights turned low  
He just says, let it snow, let it snow  
I don't care  
  
Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But that fire is, mmm, delightful  
Since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought lots of corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow  
  
When we finally say good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll only hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
Long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
