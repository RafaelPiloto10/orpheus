Wait a minute hold on get your ass up  
Whassup nigga?  
Get over there shit  
Ya lil punk ass nigga  
Come here come here come here boy  
God damnit you stop that shit now  
Take him to jail and get him the hell from in front of this house  
Now wait a minute wait a minute hey man  
Whassup?  
Wait a minute?  
There are police go!  
  
Give me that beat fool it's a full time jack move  
Chilly Chill, yo homie mack the track move  
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank  
That's the name of the suckers I done ganked  
I get away from a copper  
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper  
With the L-E-N-see-H-M-O-be  
T-Bone and that's J.D.  
And here's how we'll greet ya  
Stop fool, come off that beat ya  
Feel dumb cause you're caught in the dark  
(ya lil nuttin ass mark)  
Raise up, cause you can't' have it back  
You said "I ain't never got gaffled like that"  
Off the end of the gat you choke  
Short Dog's in the house "Whattup loc?"  
Nuttin' but a come up  
Gimme that bass, and don't try to run up  
'Cause you'll get banked somethin' sweet  
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats  
  
Huh, and even if you're down with my crew  
Yo Chuck man, I don't understand this man  
You got to slow down  
I jack them too  
And then we'll freak it  
Kick that bass, and look what we did  
Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil  
And I keep stealin  
Ice Cube'll make it funky  
But right about now - let's get up in the hump  
But I don't party and shake my butt  
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts  
And it'll drive you nuts  
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch  
Like jackin' at night  
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin'  
And it sounds so sweet  
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats  
  
Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it  
Locate a dope break, and then I break it  
And give it that gangsta lean  
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass  
I make punk suckers run and duck because  
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to  
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi  
So when I come to your town don't crowd me  
Cause I know, you're gonna want to kick it with me  
But I know, none of y'all can get with me  
So you think you're protected  
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record  
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove  
Cause suckers can't fade the Cube  
And if I jack you and you keep comin'  
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!  
  
Stop stop stop stop stop!
