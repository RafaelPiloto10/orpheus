I'm so sleepy, yeah  
I'm so sleepy, yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy  
  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
In the night I feel it creeping, creeping, creeping  
  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy  
  
I can't keep my mind away from my dreams,  
I hear them calling, calling, calling  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
Soon I'm gonna slip away  
In the night I'm gonna slip away  
I won't fight it, I'll just ride it  
  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I'm so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy  
Yeah
