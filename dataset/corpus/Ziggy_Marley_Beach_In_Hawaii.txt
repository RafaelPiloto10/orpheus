On the beach in Hawaii  
  
I wish you were here with me, walking on the beach in Hawaii  
Playing on the golden sand, looking at the ocean now I understand  
Love is like the open sea, and I wish you were here with me  
On the beach in Hawaii  
  
Since you've been gone away, I think about you everyday  
Don't you know I miss you much, and you know I need your touch  
I'm on a rocky cliff, oh I wish you were hear with me  
On the beach in Hawaii  
  
A little pakalolo, and I say mahalo  
Ujjayi breathing, to get a real feeling  
Yogi gonna let you know  
That I wish you were here with me  
On the beach in Hawaii  
In Hawaii
