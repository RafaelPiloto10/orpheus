All babies together, everyone a seed  
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need  
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed  
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world  
A harvest  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Hey  
A nation planted, so concerned with gain  
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain  
And far too many, feelin' the strain  
  
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world  
A harvest  
Yeah, yeah  
Gather every man, gather every woman  
  
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children  
Gather everyone (gather everyone)  
Gather all together (gather all together)  
Overlookin' none (overlookin' none)  
  
Hopin' life gets better for the world  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Oh  
Dress me up for the battle, when all I want is peace  
Those of ous who pay the price, come home with the least  
  
And nation after nation, turnin' into beasts  
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world  
yeah, hey  
When will there be  
  
I want to know now, now  
When will there be a harvest (harvest for the world)  
When will there be a harvest (harvest for the world)  
When will there be a harvest (harvest for the world)  
  
Everybody (harvest for the world)  
Oh, talkin' bout the children (harvest for the world)  
When will there be a harvest (harvest for the world)  
When will there be a harvest (harvest for the world)
