'Though we might hate to admit it,  
There are always two sides to every story'  
  
Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town  
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down  
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man  
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
A neighborhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night  
Young faces hide in the shadows,  
While they watch their mother and father fight  
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone  
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says  
Looks like it's just us from now on'  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now  
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now  
Be sure, before we close our eyes  
Don't walk away from here  
'Til you hear both sides  
  
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm  
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn  
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets  
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now  
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now  
Be sure, before we close our eyes  
Don't walk away from here  
'Til you see both sides  
  
White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world  
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall  
He says 'would you respect me if I didn't have this gun  
'Cause without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one'  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story
