Oh, now you can have me  
When you want me  
You simply ask me to be there  
And you're the only one  
Who makes me come running  
'Cause what you got  
Is far beyond compare  
  
And it's just like honey  
When your love comes over me  
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency  
Always strung out  
For another taste of your honey  
  
It's like honey  
When it washes over me  
You know sugar never ever was so sweet  
And I'm dying for ya  
Crying for ya  
I adore ya  
One hit of your love affected me  
And I'm strung out on you, darling  
Don't you see  
Every night and day I can hardly wait  
For another taste of honey  
  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
  
Yeah, oh  
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey  
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you  
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly  
You're the only thing I want to do  
And it's just like honey  
When your love comes over me  
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency  
Always strung out  
For another taste of your honey  
  
It's like honey  
When it washes over me  
You know sugar never ever was so sweet  
And I'm dying for ya  
Crying for ya  
I adore ya  
One hit of your love addected me  
And I'm strung out on you, darling  
Don't you see  
Every night and day I can hardly wait  
For another taste of honey  
  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
  
(Breakdown)  
Oooh, woah  
Every little thing you do  
Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you  
Honey, it's like  
  
And it's just like honey  
When your love comes over me  
Oh, baby, I've got a dependancy  
Always strung out  
For another taste of your honey  
  
It's like honey  
When it washes over me  
You know sugar never ever was so sweet  
And I'm dying for ya  
Crying for ya  
I adore ya  
One hit of your love addected me  
And I'm strung out on you, darling
