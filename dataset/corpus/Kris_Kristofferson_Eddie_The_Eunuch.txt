Eddie the Eunuch was a weasel  
Nasty as an old man's nose  
Making believin' he was evil  
Struttin' in his mama's clothes  
  
You know that Eddie had a bad connection  
Never had a chance to ball  
Sleeping in the wrong direction, baby  
Dreaming he was ten feet tall  
  
But now Eddie the Eunuch is a rock and roll critic  
Sucking like a super star  
Slicker than a shoe-shine  
Quicker than a two-time  
  
Eddie what a thang you are  
Eddie makes a damn good livin', baby  
Putting other people down  
  
Eddie couldn't ever forgive them baby  
'Cause he wasn't Jackson Browne.
