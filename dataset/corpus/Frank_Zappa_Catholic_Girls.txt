(Well)  
Catholic Girls  
With a tiny little mustache  
Catholic Girls  
Do you know how they go?  
Catholic Girls  
In the Rectory Basement  
Father Riley's a fairy  
But it don't bother Mary  
  
Catholic Girls  
At the CYO  
Catholic Girls  
Do you know how they go?  
Catholic Girls  
There can be no replacement  
How do they go, after the show?  
  
Joe:  
All the way  
That's the way they go  
Every day  
And none of their mamas ever seem to know  
Hip-Hip-Hooray  
For all the class they show  
There's nothing like a Catholic Girl  
At the CYO  
When they learn to blow . . .  
  
Father Riley:  
They're learning to blow  
All the Catholic Boys!  
  
Mary:  
Warren Cuccurullo . . .  
  
Father Riley:  
Catholic Boys!  
  
Mary:  
Kinda young, kinda WOW!  
  
Father Riley:  
Catholic Boys!  
  
Mary:  
Vinnie Colaiuta . . .  
  
Chorus:  
Where are they now?  
Did they all take The Vow?  
  
Father Riley:  
Catholic Girls!  
  
Warren:  
Carmenita Scarfone!  
  
Father Riley:  
Catholic Girls!  
  
Officer Butzis:  
Hey! She gave me VD!  
  
Father Riley:  
Catholic Girls!  
  
Warren:  
Toni Carbone!  
  
Chorus:  
With a tongue like a cow  
She could make you go WOW!  
  
Joe:  
VD Vowdy vootie  
Right away  
That's the way they go  
Every day  
Whenever their mamas take them to a show  
Matinee  
Pass the popcorn please  
There's nothing like a Catholic Girl  
With her hand in the box  
When she's on her knees  
  
Larry:  
She was on her knees  
My little Catholic Girl  
  
Chorus:  
In a little white dress  
Catholic Girls  
They never confess  
Catholic Girls  
I got one for a cousin  
I love how they go  
So send me a dozen  
Catholic Girls  
OOOOOOH!  
(Well well well)  
Catholic Girls  
(Ma-ma-mum ma-ma-mum)  
Yai-ee-ahhh!  
Catholic Girls  
OOOOOOH!  
(Well well now)  
Catholic Girls  
(Ma-ma-mum ma-ma-ma-ma-mum)  
Yai-ee-ahhh!  
Catholic Girls  
(Ma-ma ma-ma-maaah)  
OOOOOOH!  
Catholic Girls  
Yai-ee-ahhh!  
(Well well)  
Catholic Girls  
(Ma-ma ma-ma-ma-mum)  
OOOOOOH!  
(Ma-ma ma-ma ma-mum)  
Catholic Girls  
Yai-ee-ahhh!  
(Ma-ma ma-ma-ma-mum)

Catholic Girls  
Yai-ee-ahhh!

The is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER . . .  
Joe had a girl friend named Mary.  
She used to go to the church club every week.  
They'd meet each other there  
Hold hands  
And think Pure Thoughts
