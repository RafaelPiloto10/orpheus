Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Hovering over me at night  
Mama  
Comfort me, make me feel all right  
I walk alone and see what boys should never  
See in their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Come and take, come and take my hand  
Mama  
Try and see, try to understand  
Mama  
Looking through, looking through my eyes  
Mama  
Everywhere, always in disguise  
I walk alone and see what boys should never  
See in their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
Mama  
Please be good, please be good to me  
I walk alone and see what boys should never see  
I hear what boys should never hear  
In their lifetime  
I live in the world of spirits  
And I talk to the walls  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
This little hell  
Deliver me from  
Mama  
Please be good . . .
