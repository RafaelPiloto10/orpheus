Baby, if wishes could be kisses  
And dreams could make you mine  
I wouldn't be a-sitting here  
Wasting all this time  
No, no, baby, if you call me  
I'd race down the street  
I'd be there so fast  
You'd think I had wings on my feet  
Oh, baby, if wishes could be kisses  
I'd wish with all my mind  
I wouldn't have to make believe  
I'm in your arms tonight  
  
No, no, baby  
I could thrill you if you'd let me try  
We'd take off together  
And we'd tell this world goodbye  
  
But I know it just can't be  
Unless you feel the same as me, oh, yeah-heah  
Baby, if wishes could be kisses  
Then I'd be first in line  
If I'm not wrong it won't take long  
'Til you're my valentine  
  
Oh, oh, baby, if you hear me  
Make me know you do  
If I'm lucky I'll find out  
That you've been wishing too  
A-come on, baby  
A-come on, baby  
If wishes could be kisses, oh, yeah  
Oh, if wishes could be  
  
Woah, baby, if you hear me  
Make me know you do  
If I'm lucky I'll find out  
That you've been wishing too  
A-come on, baby  
Woah, come on, baby  
If wishes could be kisses, now, yeah  
If wishes could be kisses, yeah
