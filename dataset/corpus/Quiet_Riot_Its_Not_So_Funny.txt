[Verse 1]  
Walking 'round the town with nothing to do  
Rock-n-roll ringin' in my ears  
Why adjust my mind, just singin' the blues  
Got to find a way out of here  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not so funny  
Just a kid, nobody listens to me  
Ain't got no money to do what I want  
Somethings got to set me free  
  
[Verse 2]  
You say when you grow up you'll have what you want  
And everything that you need  
What is the use of having it all  
If you listen and never be seen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could suddenly be older  
I'd show them all and bring them down to my size  
  
[Verse 3]  
My parents tell me you're not the only one  
There's a lot of kids around like you  
If all of us kids got together for fun  
We'd show you a thing or two  
  
No no no  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
It's not so funny  
I ain't got no money  
It's not so funny  
I ain't got no money  
It's not so funny
