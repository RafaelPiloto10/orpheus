Bobby band a-rockin'  
And the bobby soxer's doing the twist  
It's a bobby soxer beat  
And you can rock it any way you wish  
Work out, bobby soxer, you can  
Wiggle like a whimsical fish  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
When the weekend comes  
You'll be right back rockin' some more  
Bobby soxer dancin'  
But she keeps peepin' on the stand  
Bobby soxer's got a crush  
On a beatle in the bobby band  
Love bug sure gonna bite her  
If the beatle even wave his hand  
Twist on, bobby soxer  
But don't forget the bobby rule  
It's getting late, bobby soxer  
And the teacher teachin' you in school  
And tomorrow morning, bobby soxer  
You'll be back in school
