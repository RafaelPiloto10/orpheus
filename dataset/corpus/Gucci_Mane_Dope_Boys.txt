Verse 1  
All I Need Is One Mic All I Need Is One Stove  
Homie Got A Nice Flow But Gucci Got That White Coke  
You Ain't Gettin The Right Dope, You Knockin On The Wrong Door  
Last Nigga Tried Me Let's Just Callem John Doe  
And Since You Short A Dime Homie Then Park Me A Old School  
I Fronted You, You Ran Off That's Not What You're Supposed To Do  
I'm Gettin My Tip Fade Cut Pour The Chris And Flat Show  
Wish A Nigga Would Run Up On Me Like I'm Bristol  
Yeaaaaa  
Gucci Mans A Live Wire  
Try Me Like I'm Yung Berg And Imma Make Yo Eyes Cry  
Gucci Like To Drank And Gucci Like To Smoke  
And Gucci On A Rise While Ya'll Niggas Goin Broke  
Gucci! Gucci Mans A G, Tell Me Sumthin I Don't Know  
I Got Court In Early Mornin I Don't Really Wanna Go  
I Do This For The People Cause I'm My Brothers Keeper  
I Don't Fear You Cause I'm Parrapalegic, Wheres My Parralegal  
  
Chorus  
See That House Right There Yea Make A Lot A Money  
Whos That Knockin At The Door  
Probably A Couple Junkies

See My Neighborhood Is Buckin Tell My Plug To Keep It Comin  
Dopeboys, Dopeboys With The Dopeboys X2  
What You Wanna Get Homie Hurry Up And Buy It  
Dopeboys don't Die Homie We Just Multiply  
  
Verse 2  
I'm In My M6 Beemer  
This Is No 645  
Like A Pigeon In The Sky, I Just Shitted On Your Ride  
So Much Weight Off In My House, You Would Think It Was A Gym  
Plus My Nikes Match My Necklace And My Necklace Match My Rims  
I Got Court In Early Mornin I Don't Really Wana Go  
Say I Violated Probation Just Because I Blew My Nose  
Blew 300 On My Rolce  
200 More On The Lamb  
Million Dollars On The Crib  
Car Note, Don't Know What That Is  
Gucci, You Don't Know Who That Is  
Mama That's Just Gucci Man That's My Boy That's My Partna  
I'm Gucci Man Biggest Fan  
Plus She Don't Know What That Is  
I'm With That I Don't Give A Damn  
If You Think I Give A Fuck You Must Do Not Know Who I am, Gucci  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Mirror Mirror Mirror  
Whos The Realest In The Game  
Why You Ask That Stupid Question  
Boy You Know That's Gucci Mane  
East Atlanta 6  
You Know How We Roll  
I Just Bought Anotha Chevy Got It Right Back Out The Bowl  
Tall Stacks Up In My Closet I Can't Even See My Clothes  
And My Belly Get So Big I Can Hardly See My Toes  
Got A Car In My Garage I Have Never Ever Drove  
It's A Door Black On Black Phantom I Call That Bitch Dorrough  
If She Going To The Ladies Room I Guess I'll Let Her Know  
I Got Powder In My Living Room, So She Don't Have To Stroll  
A Year Ago Today, I Was Sitting In My Cell  
Where You See Yoself In 5 Years  
A So Icey Billionare  
Gucci  
  
Chorus
