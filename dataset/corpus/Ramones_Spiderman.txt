Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies  
Look out, here comes the Spiderman  
  
Is he strong? Listen bud, he's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead  
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman  
  
In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime  
Like a streak of light he arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman  
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward  
Look out, here comes the Spiderman  
  
Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood, Spiderman  
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward  
To him, life's a great big bang up, whenever there's a hang up,  
You'll find the Spiderman!
