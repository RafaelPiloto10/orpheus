Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hall  
She said that she'd be back in no time at all here I sit drivin' nails in the
wall  
In the dark that stacks around me dreams of you keep pounding me  
Leading me to where I've never been  
And the voice keeps telling me this could be insanity but I know my name as
well as you  
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall...  
In the wilted patterns of my mind find that I've left you behind  
Sowing up my torn memories  
Surviving living three bed room electric kitchen and living room  
Just burning and it's on a new free way  
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hall  
She said that she'd be back in no time at all  
When she is back I'm gonna nail to the wall
