I had a dream,  
Last night I was blind  
And I couldn't see  
Color of any kind  
  
Picture the world, minus a rainbow  
When day becomes night, then where will the sun go  
Dancing alone, just me and my shadow  
Color me blind, so I can see no evil  
  
Why do we dream in black and white?  
Color me blind  
Why do we dream in black and white?  
Color me blind  
  
I had a dream,  
I was looking, over the mountain  
But I've, I've yet to see the,  
The so-called promised land  
  
Picture the world,  
Without any color  
You couldn't tell,  
One face from the other  
I don't understand  
Why we fight with our brother  
Color me blind  
Just to love one another  
  
Color me, color you,  
Color me blind
