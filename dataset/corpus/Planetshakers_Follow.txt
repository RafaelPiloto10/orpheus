VERSE  
Where can I hide  
Where Your Love cannot reach me  
Where can I go  
Where Your arms, they're not here for me  
Where can I run to  
Where I cannot feel Your Love  
  
PRE-CHORUS  
Jesus Your Love rescued me  
So I'll follow after You  
  
CHORUS  
Wherever You take me, I'm following You  
I'm gonna follow You  
With everything I say and everything I do  
I'm gonna follow You  
With every step I take I know that You're with me  
I'm gonna follow You  
I'm taking up my cross I'm following You  
I'm gonna follow You  
  
BRIDGE  
You're everything that I live for  
I'll follow after You  
Every day of my life Lord  
I'll follow after You  
  
TAG  
I'll follow after You  
I'm gonna follow You  
(REPEAT)
