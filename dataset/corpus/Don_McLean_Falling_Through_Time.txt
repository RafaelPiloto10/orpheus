I can't answer the questions you ask me,  
I don't know what to say.  
The answers are somewhere lost in the stars  
when the night has turned to day.  
But I know if the silence of night could be here,  
It would drift through my soul and calm all my fear  
And I could reach out and draw you so near to me  
  
Touch me and warm me and I will lie still.  
And all that you ask me to give you I will  
One living moment we'll have for our own.  
A brief flash of time that we spent all alone.  
But you ask me for nothing and give what you can  
And we're wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again  
And my memory drifts through the universe when we are one  
  
Closely we're falling through time  
And the earth will turn in the silence of space,  
always in motion yet always in place  
And all things will change yet remain what they are.  
And far will be near and near will be far  
And the ages will darken and blend into time  
And all that is poetry will no longer rhyme  
But our moment together is forever sublime  
  
For the time has arrived when we must understand  
That we're lost in a void on this sad speck of sand  
And nobody knows where we are, no one cares  
And the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares  
And the madmen who plunder this world for their fame  
Have forgotten that no one remembers their name  
But time and the universe are always the same  
  
Closely we're falling through time
