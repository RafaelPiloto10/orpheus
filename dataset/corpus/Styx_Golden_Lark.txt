one day you're up  
and the next day you're down  
and all your dreams  
pass you by  
  
you sit in your room  
with your face in a frown  
waiting for her  
last goodbye  
  
and all of the wishing wells  
and stars in the sky  
won't make her stay any more  
  
and all of the plans you've made  
will soon wash to sea  
like a lark who can't sing any more  
  
once in awhile you remember her laugh  
for she could make you feel strong  
'twas then that you thought your love always would last  
but now it seems you were wrong  
  
and all of the wishing wells  
and stars in the sky  
won't make her stay anymore  
  
and all of the plans you've made  
will soon wash to sea  
like a lark who can't sing any more  
golden lark won't you sing any more  
  
golden lark  
keeps her heart  
riding on the wind  
  
she's a mystery  
like a gypsy  
hides her love within  
  
golden lark  
keeps her heart  
riding on the wind  
  
she's a mystery  
like a gypsy  
hides her love within  
  
la la la la  
la la la la  
la la la la la
