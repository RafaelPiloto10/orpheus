Come my love  
Come bravely to me  
Let your heart be still  
For our time  
Has come my tender one  
To be free of will  
  
And fly  
Blind on fearless love  
Let them wild winds blow  
We'll shine  
On all we're fearful of  
Then we'll let it go  
Let it go  
  
Skippin' stones  
Across the great unknown  
Safe at water's edge  
Don't look down, baby  
We're gonna leave this losin' town  
(and) leap out from the ledge  
  
And fly  
Blind on fearless love  
Let them wild winds blow  
We'll shine  
On all we're fearful of  
Then we'll let it go  
Let it go
