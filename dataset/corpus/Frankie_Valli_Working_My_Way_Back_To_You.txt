Working my way back to you, babe  
With a burnin' love inside  
Yeah, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe  
And the happiness that died  
I let it get away  
Been payin' every day  
  
When you were so in love with me  
I played around like I was free  
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too  
But how I cried over losin' you  
See me cryin' now, but I ain't about to go  
Livin' my life without you  
For every day I made you cry  
I'm payin', girl, 'til the day that I die  
  
I used to love to make you cry  
It made me feel like a man inside  
But if I'd been a man in reality  
You'd still be here, babe, lovin' me  
Now the nights are long and lonely  
And I ain't through strugglin', I just miss you so  
And you're too proud you won't give in  
But when I think about all I can win  
  
Working my way back to you, babe  
With a burnin' love inside  
Yeah, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe  
And the happiness that died, oh how I cried
