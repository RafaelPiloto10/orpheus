I thought I'd give my love to anyone today  
But when it came to you one thing was for sure  
Well I know your little games and I don't want to play  
It's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure  
You come on like the princess of the junior prom  
Always part of everything that's going down  
Just looking for another fool to lean upon  
In the center ring and everyone's your clown  
  
Can't you see I've lost my nerve  
I just can't face you  
Perhaps I'll let the time erase you  
Can't you see I've lost my nerve  
I just can't face you  
Perhaps I'll let the time erase you  
  
I thought I'd give my love to anyone today  
But when it came to you one thing was for sure  
Well I know your little games and I don't want to play  
It's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure
