Frosty, the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty, the snowman is a fairy tale, they say  
He was made of snow but the children know  
That he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Thumpetty, thump, thump, thumpety, thump, thump  
Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow  
  
Frosty, the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now, before I melt away"  
  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there, all around the square  
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
He only paused a moment  
When he heard him holler, "Stop"  
  
Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin', "Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day, I'll be back again some day  
I'll be back again some day"
