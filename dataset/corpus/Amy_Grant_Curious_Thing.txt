There was this guy, he was down on his luck  
He was truly poverty's child  
Well, he had no home and he had no car  
And he wore a weary smile  
Moved out to l.a., knocked around for awhile  
But he was getting nowhere  
Then he did this movie and it did really well  
Now he's a millionaire  
See, life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
I know a man who could paint the town red  
Had a college degree in fun  
'till the doorbell rang and a long lost flame said  
"this little boy is your son"  
Gave him a suitcase and a bear  
Left 'em in a cloud of dust  
Now he's checking out schools and driving carpools  
Learning to adjust  
He says life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Well, I know that it can be demanding  
I know that it can be unkind  
I don't really understand it  
But lord sure knows I try  
Life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Let me tell you 'bout a kid I knew  
A pudgy girl back in school  
She had greasy hair and geeky glasses  
Object of ridicule  
The other day in the check out line  
They were ringing up my rice and beans  
There she was, a pretty little face  
On the cover of a magazine  
And I said life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
(chorus)  
  
Just goes to show that you never know  
Just what tomorrow may bring  
But I'll tell you this that what it is  
Is seldom what it seems  
'cause life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing. . .
