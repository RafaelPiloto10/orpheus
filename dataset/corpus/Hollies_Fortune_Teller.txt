(Neville)  
Went to a fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didn't know what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
She took a hold of my palm  
She said Son you feel kind of warm  
And then she looked into a crystal ball  
She said You're in love  
  
I said how could that be so  
I'm not friendly with the girls I know  
She said when the next one arrives  
You gotta look into her eyes  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Looking forward to my big surprise  
The next day I discovered  
That the fortune teller told me lies  
  
I rushed straight back to that woman  
Just as mad as I could be  
I said I didn't see nobody  
Why'd she made a fool of me  
  
Then something struck me  
Like lightning from up above  
While looking at the fortune teller  
I fell in love  
  
Now I'm a happy fella  
I'm married to the fortune teller  
I'm as happy as I can be  
Now I get my fortunes told for free
