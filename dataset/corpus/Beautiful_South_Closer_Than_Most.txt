Well I kept fantasizing your eyes were wide open  
and it made me long for little last night  
Yes it was frantic, it was young, it was sweet  
But a sweet worth every bite  
  
Now I'm not normally one to be greedy  
But I had to be greedy with you  
5 days, 6 days. the whole of the month  
wouldn't satisfy my only sweet tooth  
  
[chorus]  
Well it can take many years to forge a friendship  
It can take a lifetime to get close  
But we took all the shortcuts,  
used our hearts as a map  
and we still got closer than most  
  
hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
  
Well excuse my staring but it's just your looks  
are a standard well above myself  
Your face might mean zip to you  
But to me it's something else  
  
All I can do is thank you  
and wish that every dream you have will come true  
5 years, 6 years, the whole of your life  
I'll be wishing for the riches for you  
  
[chorus]  
  
You dashed pretty's only chance of a compliment  
and gave the plain the blues  
Turned supermodel into last year's pull  
and got her down shining your shoes  
  
And I don't mean to be hod carrier  
of the ordinary folks bad news  
But tell Miss World to fly to Mars  
If she really doesn't like to lose.  
  
[chorus]
