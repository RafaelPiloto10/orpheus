I was blue ain't sky and sea  
Some of that blue's bound to get on me  
But the blues don't come to stay  
They'll move away on a better day  
  
Troubles, and woes and misery  
Ain't gonna get the best of me  
Lift the shades, fix my gaze  
On a better day, clear the way  
  
Better days just up ahead  
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed  
When people ain't messing with my head  
There's a better way, there's a brighter day  
  
There's a better day with clearer skies  
Hope and promise on the rise  
Oh the future is looking bright  
On those better days, look away, look away  
  
Better day oh  
  
Better days just up ahead  
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed  
And people ain't messing with my head  
There's a better day, there's a better day  
  
I was blue it ain't sky and sea  
Some of that blue's gonna fall on me  
Oh the future's looking bright  
There's a better bay  
Look away, look away
