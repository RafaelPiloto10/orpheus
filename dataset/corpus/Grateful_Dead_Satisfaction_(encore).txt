I can't get no, satisfaction. I can't get no satisfaction.  
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try, I can't get no, I can't get no.  
When I'm driving in my car and that man comes on the radio  
And he's telling me more and more about some useless information  
Supposed to fire my imagination  
I can't get no, Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say.  
When I'm watching my tv and that man comes on to tell me how white my shirts
[?]  
When I'm riding 'round the world and I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that  
And I'm trying to make some girl  
Who tells me, baby maybe come back later next week  
Cause you see I'm on a losing streak
