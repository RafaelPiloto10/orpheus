Big Sky looked down on all the people looking up at the big sky,  
Everybody's pushing one another around.  
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry,  
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down.  
  
Big Sky's too big to cry.  
Big Sky's too high to see  
People like you and me.  
  
One day, we'll be free.  
We won't care, just you see.  
Til then,  
Don't let it get you down.  
  
When I feel that the world's too much for me  
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me.  
  
Big Sky looked down at all the people who think they've got problems.  
They get depressed and they hold their heads in their hands and they cry.  
People lift their hands and they look up to the Big Sky.  
But Big Sky's too big to sympathize.  
  
Big Sky's too occupied,  
Though he would like to try,  
Then he feels bad inside.  
Big Sky's too big to cry.  
  
One day, we'll be free,  
We won't care, just you wait and see.  
Til then,  
Don't let it get you down.
