Last night I got served a little bit too much of that poison baby  
Last night I did things I'm not proud of  
And I got a little crazy  
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor  
And I let him call me baby  
  
And I don't even know his last name  
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed  
It started off "Hey cutie, where ya from?"  
And then it turned in,  
"Oh no, what have I done?"  
And I don't even know his last name  
  
We left the club right around three o'clock in the morning  
His Pinto sitting there in the parking lot Well it should have been a warning  
I had no clue what I was getting into  
So I blame it on the Cuervo  
Oh where did my manners go?  
  
And I don't even know his last name  
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed  
It started off "Hey cutie, where ya from?"  
And then it turned in,  
"Oh no, what have I done?"  
And I don't even know his last name  
Here we go...  
  
Today I woke up thinkin' about Elvis somewhere in Vegas  
I'm not sure how I got here  
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared out of nowhere  
I gotta go  
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road  
They say what happens here stays here  
All of this will disappear  
There's just one little problem...  
  
I don't even know my last name  
Oh my mama would be so ashamed  
It started off "Hey cutie, where ya from?"  
And then it turned in,  
"Oh no, what have I done?"  
And I don't even know my last name  
  
What have I done  
What have I done  
What have I done  
Oh, what have I done  
I don't even know my last name  
  
It turned into  
"Oh no, what have I done?"  
And I don't even know my last  
  
It started off "Hey cutie, where ya from?"  
And then it turned into  
"Oh no, what have I done?"  
And I don't even know my last name  
  
My last name
