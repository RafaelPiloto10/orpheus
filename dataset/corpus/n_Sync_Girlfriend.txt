Would you be my Girlfriend? [Repeat: x3]  
I like you, right  
Would you be my Girlfriend?  
  
I don't know why you care  
He doesn't even know you're there  
Cause he don't love your eyes  
And he don't love your smile  
Girl you know that ain't fair  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is he going to be by your side  
Or will he run and hide  
You don't know cuz things ain't clear  
And baby when you cry  
Is he gonna stand by your side  
Does the man even know you're alive  
I got an idea  
  
Why don't you be my girlfriend  
I'll treat you good  
I know you hear your friends when they say  
You should  
Cause if you were my girlfriend  
I'd be your shining star  
The one who'll show you where you are  
Girl you should be my girlfriend  
  
Does he know what you feel  
Are you sure that t's real  
Does he ease your mind  
Or does he break your stride  
Did you know that love could be a shield  
  
In the middle of the night correcting  
Is he going to be BY your side  
Or will he run and hide  
You don't know cause things ain't clear  
And baby when you cry  
Is he gonna stand by your side  
Does the man even know you're alive  
I got an idea  
  
Why don't you be my girlfriend  
I'll treat you good  
I know you hear your friends when they say  
You should  
Cause if you were my girlfriend  
I'd be your shining star  
The one who'll show you where you are  
Girl you should be my girlfriend  
  
Ever since I saw your face  
Nothing in my life has been the same  
I'll walk around just saying your name  
Without you, my world would end, yeah  
I've looked around this whole, damn place  
And everything says you were meant to be  
My girlfriend, oh  
  
Why don't you be my girlfriend  
I'll treat you good  
I know you hear your friends when they say  
You should  
Cause if you were my girlfriend  
I'd be your shining star  
The one who'll show you where you are  
Girl you should be my girlfriend  
  
Girl you should be My girlfriend [Repeat: x5]  
My girlfriend
