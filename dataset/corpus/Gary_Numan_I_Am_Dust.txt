We we're dust in a world  
Of grim obsession.  
  
We were torn from our  
Life of isolation.  
  
We we're pulled from our path  
Of least resistance.  
  
And the songs we sang  
What became of us?  
  
We're here waiting for you  
We're here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
  
We all pray for the end  
For the god to take us.  
  
We we're falling down  
One by one.  
  
We we're weak and the fear  
Was all around us.  
  
The machines screamed from  
Moon to sun.  
  
We're here waiting for you  
We're here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you
