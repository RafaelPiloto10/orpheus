As I'm looking back in time  
My heart was young and the world was mine  
Driven by desires blind  
I remember someone told me as the years roll by  
Remember one thing, the one thing  
People come and people go  
The way the winds of fortune blow  
So hard to find that heart of gold  
I remember someone told me  
When you find it, don't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby  
Makes this world heaven  
Makes the whole thing right  
You're the one thing  
That means something, baby  
The one I believe in  
The one thing I need in my life  
  
As I look into your lovin' eyes  
There ain't no doubt just where my treasure lies  
I've searched the earth for somethin' true  
But the only truth that matters is my love for you  
  
And that's the one thing, the one thing  
Timeless as the stars, faithful as the sea  
Like the endless risin' sun, I know you'll be there for me  
There's so much love inside, this heart of mine could break  
'Cause I know I've found forever and with every breath I take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And your love is like a rainbow  
In a world that's black and white  
You paint my dreams in color  
And in your arms they come alive  
You're my every inspiration  
You're the wings that make me fly  
You're my only destination  
You're the one thing, the one thing in my life, oh  
You're the one thing, you're the one thing, baby  
  
[Chorus]
