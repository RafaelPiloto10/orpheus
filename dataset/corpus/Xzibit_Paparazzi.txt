1996, the Disfunctional member of the Alkohaliks family  
It's XZIBIT, Bring it live, one time, like this  
  
Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while  
Xzibit stay versitile  
With Million Dollar lifestyle  
And I can feel it as a child growin' up  
  
The niggaz that were real and the niggaz that were scared as fuck  
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few  
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you  
So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin shit  
  
It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin with  
I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof ticket  
Nigga you make a gang of noise and never seem like a cricket  
I guess that's why we never kick it  
  
A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin to fuck with the liquid  
How many niggaz do you know like this?  
Also claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch  
It don't make sense  
  
Either you're a soldier from the start  
Or an actor with a record deal tryin to play the part  
Like dat  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a shame  
Niggaz in the rap game  
Only for the money and the fame  
EXTRA LARGE  
It's a shame  
Niggaz in the rap game  
Only for the money and the fame  
Paparazzi  
  
I don't need no lights no cameras  
Just action god dammit  
Never no superstar  
I'm more like a planet  
  
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat  
A merchant from the fog with my fucked up dialogue  
Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt  
And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck  
  
Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis  
Home of the scandalous  
Big Bad Los Angeles  
Dangerous, Vandelous  
  
Yo, not to be trusted  
So how the fuck is you hard  
Not being scared by the boulevard  
I'm pulling that card and sayin Gin muthafuckar  
  
Flowin like liquid, soak it in muthafuckar  
I'm breakin it down, my sounds, so crowds are like deaf  
From the West  
Puttin whole counties to the test  
  
It's all in perspective  
Breaker one-nine copy  
This is for the niggaz gettin caught up in the Paparazzi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress  
But I just play the back  
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams  
For a contract  
  
Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel  
I made a cool half mil  
Before I had a record deal  
There for you look and stare like it's magic  
  
Too much of anything can make you an addict  
When devils be startin static, forgot the automatic  
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait  
Who dare to cross this path  
  
Yo, I do ya like math  
Cut with glass, make a blood bath  
So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with  
Smoke a lot of blunts with  
  
I dispose of your punk shit  
Keep it all in perspective  
Carbon Copies gettin caught up in the Paparazzi  
  
[Chorus]
