I'll chase it away, I'll chase it away, I'll chase it babe  
I'll chase it away, I'll chase it away, I'll chase it babe  
  
I was here before, when I been born  
I was loved once... Now mine  
Lessons learned  
Now I'm so afraid to loose control  
So my heart says yes I still say no  
I'm chasing your love, I'm chasing your love, away  
One taste of your love and I'm chasing your love away  
  
They say nothing ventured is nothing gained  
I don't know if falling in love is ever worth the pain  
If I bathe in your river then I may drown  
  
So the chance of a lifetime I'll turn it down  
I'm chasing your love, I'm chasing your love, away  
One taste of your love and I'm chasing your love away  
  
Oh, maybe this could last forever, baby I don't know  
But I don't wanna wait forever, baby you should go  
I'm chasing your love, I'm chasing your love, away  
One taste of your love and I'm chasing your love away  
I'm chasing your love, I'm chasing your love, away  
One taste of your love and I'm chasing your love away.
