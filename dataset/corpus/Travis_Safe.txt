Take all the goods from all the bads  
And tell the people that you've gone away  
Now lift your head up to the sky  
And now you can tell apart the black from the white  
  
We waste the time they treasure dear  
My only thought is that they could be right  
  
Oh look there goes another year,  
About as distant as a satellite  
  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe  
  
The world's a small child in the dark  
And my mind's a safe place that its always been  
The monsters seem to fade so fast  
Upon the waking of another dream  
  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, I feel so brave  
I'm not afraid of anything they've got to say  
And you're okay because you're tucked away  
Don't go astray you've got to be just who you are  
Who you are  
  
When I was young things didn't last  
My only care stemmed to the the price of sweets  
Now that I'm older I can laugh  
A dolly mixed up man of rotten teeth  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe  
And I feel safe, so safe,  
So safe
