Words and music by bob seger  
  
There's a highway  
A lonesome stretch of gray  
It runs between us  
And takes me far away  
Out in the distance  
Always within reach  
There's a crossroad  
Where all the victims meet  
I close my eyes  
And see her face  
It's all I want to see  
And deep inside  
It still amazes me  
  
Even now  
She's all that I want  
She's all that I need  
Even now  
She's givin' it all  
She's givin' it free  
Even now  
When everything's right  
When everything's wrong  
Even now  
She's keepin' me straight  
She's keepin' me strong  
She gets to me  
Somehow  
Even now  
  
And through the darkness  
Through all the endless days  
Through all the changes  
The pointless one act plays  
I can still make it  
I can still stand tall  
Cause I've got my girl  
To get me through it all  
Through all the doubt  
And all the fear  
And all that I can't say  
Still somehow  
She'll help me find my way  
  
Even now  
She's still in my heart  
She's still in my soul  
Even now  
She's still on my mind  
Wherever I go  
Even now  
Through all of my days  
And all of my nights  
Even now  
She's keepin' it real  
She's keepin' it right  
  
She gets to me  
Somehow  
Even now  
She's all that I want  
She's all that I need  
Even now  
  
She's givin' it all  
She's givin' it free  
When everything's right  
When everything's wrong  
She's keepin' it real  
She's keepin' it strong  
Even now
