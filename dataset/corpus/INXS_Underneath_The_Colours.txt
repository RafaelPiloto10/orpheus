No division in the ranks  
The lines are long and proud  
No question on their lips  
But there will always be, doubt  
  
Like a Chinese painting  
All red with its message  
A flag high in the sky  
Twists and turns its, language  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Underneath the colors red blue white  
Catch a glimpse of others  
From the corner of your eye  
  
With the rise and fall  
Of the conductor's blind hand  
The Russian Roulette  
I am an angry young man  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
[Repeat: 1st verse]  
  
[Chorus: 4X]
