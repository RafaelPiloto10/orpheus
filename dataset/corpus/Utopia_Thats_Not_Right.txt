If you don't feel like dancing tonight  
Well that's all right  
And if you don't feel like holding me tight  
Well that's all right  
Cause I know that you love me  
And you'll show that you love me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you feel like hurting me baby  
That's not right  
  
If you don't want to go anywhere  
Well I don't mind  
If you want to stay home and play with your hair  
I still don't mind  
Cause I know that you need me  
And you'll know how to please me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you want to leave me well baby  
Then I mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I know that I've been guilty of lying  
I know I had a whole lot of nerve  
But the way that you treat me since I begged your pardon  
Is something that I don't deserve  
  
And if you don't care to give me a date  
Well that's all right  
Cause I don't care how long I have to wait  
I've got all night  
Cause I know that you want to  
But you know that you're going to make me lose my mind  
And if you can not think of me baby  
That's not right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
feel like dancing tonight  
Well that's all right  
And if you don't feel like holding me tight  
Well that's all right  
Cause I know that you love me  
And you'll show that you love me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you feel like hurting me baby  
That's not right
