Nothin' to do in this lonely town  
Your daddy warned me, "Son, you come around"  
Says I ain't good enough for you  
He don't know what I'm goin' through  
  
Let's do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window, girl  
And we'll be gone  
Let's do something  
Oh, baby, let's do something  
Even if it's wrong  
  
Go see the preacher 'cross the couty line  
For 25 dollars he could make you mine  
My heart's on fire, can't you feel it burn  
I'm past the point of no return  
  
Let's do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window, girl  
And we'll be gone  
Let's do something  
Oh, baby, let's do something  
Even if it's wrong  
  
I'll make your daddy understand  
Oh, Lord, I know I can make him understand  
I'll face your daddy man to man  
No guts, no glory, girl, I'll take that chance  
  
Let's do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window, girl  
And we'll be gone  
Let's do something  
Oh, baby, let's do something  
Even if it's wrong  
  
Let's do something  
Sneak out your bedroom window, girl  
And we'll be gone  
Let's do something  
Oh, baby, let's do something  
Even if it's wrong
