I, I am confused, fighting myself  
Wanting to give in, needing your help  
Skin cold with fear, feel it when we touch  
Outside I know you, but inside I'm fucked  
Can you see it in me, skin cold from touch  
Each turn confronted with what I have done  
  
You pull me closer, I push you away  
You tell me it's okay, I can't help but feel the pain  
I hate you  
  
Why are you taken?  
I loved you  
I feel so helpless  
Why is it you?  
  
Ripping my insides each time I lay with you  
Why do I cry (try)?  
Why do I really (fucking) need to?  
Why  
Fuck you, bitch!  
Need to fuck  
Slut
