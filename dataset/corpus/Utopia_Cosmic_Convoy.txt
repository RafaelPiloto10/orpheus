Space cowboy:  
Breaker, breaker, breaker, this is the space cowboy out here,  
And I am four light years away from the planet saturn.  
Anybody out there got your ears on?  
Why don't you tell me about it?  
Jupiter moon:  
Hello [...] space cowboy. this is jupiter moon talking at you  
From mulitoid space. got some folks over here on your back door.  
No one over here at your front door. looks like we got us a  
Cosmic convoy.  
Space cowboy:  
Ah, tell me something now, we got that jupiter probe out there  
Still?  
Jupiter moon:  
Yeah, [...] right behind you, following you.  
Space cowboy:  
Well tell me something, got any word on mr. spock out there?  
Is he looking around for us?  
Jupiter moon:  
Ah, word I get is you better slow down a little bit. I know  
He's pushing 19 g's right now, and I think that's a little  
Above the limit.  
Space cowboy:  
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm rigged up, but I thought I could  
Make up a little time here. I lost so much time coming around  
The sun.  
Jupiter moon:  
Yeah I know, scooby doo for me too, sun spots [...]  
Ok, space cowboy [...]  
Space cowboy:  
[...] and I'm putting the hammer down. it's been fun running  
With you. we'll see you next century.  
Jupiter moon:  
[...]
