We've got barefoot ladies  
And tricked out Mercedes'  
People getting crazy on the boulevard  
We've got classic colas and ice cold Coronas  
Big cool parties in the back yard  
  
I said "Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime"  
  
You'll see straw sombreros  
And T-top Camaros  
Stereos blastin' in the parking lot  
You'll see rock hard bodies and bikini hotties  
And everybody's got it goin' on  
They're showing what they got  
  
Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
  
I said, "Hey everybody  
Can't you feel the rhythm now?  
Hey everybody don't you wanna party?  
Hey everybody can't you feel the rhythm now?  
Hey everybody don't you wanna party?"  
  
Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends, blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
Good times, sunshine and summertime
