My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head  
The way he described it  
He said I'd be better dead than live  
I didn't listen to his jive  
I knew all along  
That he was all wrong  
And I knew that he thought  
I was crazy but I'm not  
Oh no  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head  
He said I'd need treatment  
But I'm not that easily led  
He said I was the type  
That was most inclined  
When out of his sight  
To be out of my mind  
And he thought I was nuts  
No more ifs or ands or buts  
  
They say as a child  
I appeared a little bit wild  
With all my crazy ideas  
But I knew what was happening  
I knew I was a genius...  
What's so strange when you know  
That you're a wizard at three  
I knew that this was meant to be  
  
Now I heard little children  
Were supposed to sleep tight  
That's why I got into the vodka one night  
My parents got frantic  
Didn't know what to do  
But I saw some crazy scenes  
Before I came to  
Now do you think I was crazy  
I may have been only three  
But I was swinging  
  
They all laugh at angry young men  
They all laugh at Edison  
And also at Einstein  
So why should I feel sorry  
If they just couldn't understand  
The idiomatic logic  
That went on in my head  
I had a brain  
It was insane  
Oh they used to laugh at me  
When I refused to ride  
On all those double decker buses  
All because there was no driver on the top  
  
My analyst told me  
That I was right out of my head  
But I said dear doctor  
I think that it's you instead  
Because I have got a thing  
That's unique and new  
To prove it I'll have  
The last laugh on you  
'Cause instead of one head  
I got two  
And you know two heads are better than one.
