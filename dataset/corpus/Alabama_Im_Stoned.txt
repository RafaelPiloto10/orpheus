Sittin' here and rinkin'. Hey that's my fav'right song.  
What's that that Ihear ringin'? Would someone get the phone?  
Wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
Our love, a fadin mem'ry as I chase another down.  
My eyes are gettin' heavy and my head's spinnin' 'round.  
Stil wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned.  
Closing time, I drive for home not feelin' any pain.  
Thoughts of her drift back tome through the fallin' rain.  
Not caring if she ever come shome.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.
