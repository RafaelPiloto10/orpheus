She's a rich kid  
She wears diamond rings  
Knows how to walk  
Knows everything  
About love, she's not too sure  
  
What she's looking for  
Fresh from the woods  
Out on the street  
She's looking good  
Looking so neat  
She don't know if she should  
  
'Cause she don't know  
If she's bad or good  
She don't care if it  
Hurts her father  
She don't care if it  
  
Breaks her mother  
She don't care anymore  
She just wants what  
She's never had before  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
  
She wants love  
And she's gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
She's gotta have it, someone to love  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
Gotta have love, she'll get it  
All she needs is love  
  
She's never had it, someone to love  
She was a school boy's dream  
High school queen  
She had it all when she was sixteen  
Stayed away from boys  
'Cause she thought she'd get hurt  
  
Why did she listen to  
Her mother's words  
Couldn't go out  
Had to stay home  
And how she hated  
Being on her own  
She needs love like everybody else  
Now she's gonna  
Get some for herself  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
  
She wants love  
And she's gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
She's gotta have it, she needs love  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
She wants love  
And she's gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
She's gotta have it, someone
