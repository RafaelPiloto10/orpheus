Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling for you and for me  
See on the portals He's waiting  
And watching  
Watching for you and for me  
  
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling for you and for me  
See on the portals He's waiting  
And watching  
Watching for you and for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling  
Calling, oh sinner, come home  
  
Why should we tarry when  
Jesus is pleading  
Pleading for you and for me  
Why should we linger and  
Head not His mercies  
Mercies for you and for me  
  
Oh! for the wonderful love He  
Has promised  
Promised for you and for me  
Tho' we have sinned He has mercy  
And pardon  
Pardon for you and for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
