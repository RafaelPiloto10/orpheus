You asked I came so behold the Queen  
Let's add a little sense to the scene  
I'm living positive not out here knocked up  
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up  
  
This rhyme doesn't require prime time  
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine  
Back again cause I knew you wanted it  
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it  
  
Dropping bombs you're up in arms, you're puzzled  
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle  
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track  
From KRS to be exact  
  
It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking  
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking  
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you  
About the evil that men do  
  
Situations, reality, what a concept!  
Nothing ever seems to stay in step  
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers  
Here are some things I want to cover  
  
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?  
Because she's living on welfare  
The government can't come up with a decent housing plan  
So she's in no man's land  
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal  
  
KRS-One: You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom!  
  
Queen Latifah: We the people hold these truths to be self-evident  
  
[KRS-One]  
But there's no response from the president  
  
Queen Latifah:  
Someone's living the good life, tax-free  
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free  
And that's just part of the message  
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do  
  
Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?  
When someone can put a quarter in a video game  
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street  
You can't treat him the same  
  
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind  
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds  
You to a doom, a fate worse than death  
But there's still time left  
  
Stop putting your conscience on cease  
And bring about some type of peace  
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind  
It will benefit all mankind  
Then there will be one thing that will never stop  
And it's the evil that men do
