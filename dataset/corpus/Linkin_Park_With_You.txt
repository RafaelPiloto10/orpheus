I woke up in a dream today  
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor  
Forgot all about yesterday  
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore  
A little taste of hypocrisy  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
Even though you're so close to me  
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back  
  
It's true  
The way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
  
I'm with you  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
  
I hit you and you hit me back  
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still  
Fine line between this and that  
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real  
Now I'm trapped in this memory  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
Even though you're close to me  
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back  
  
It's true  
The way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
  
I'm with you  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
You  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
  
No, no matter how far we've come  
I can't wait to see tomorrow  
No matter how far we've come  
I can't wait to see tomorrow  
With you  
  
With you  
You  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
With you  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes  
With you  
Now I see  
Keeping everything inside  
With you  
Now I see  
Even when I close my eyes
