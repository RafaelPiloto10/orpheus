Say sayonara darling  
This time goodbye  
No bon voyage,  
It's time to fly  
I can see the breakdown coming  
Like a twisted wreck  
Let's save ourselves the sorrow  
Before we hit the deck  
  
From the high plains  
To the border  
All across the land  
From the flying of the flag  
To lovers kissing hands  
  
You can cover me in roses  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future I don't know  
I am just here to watch the river flow  
  
A street full of whispers,  
Rings like a chinese gong  
A room full of would be's  
Whose lives have gone wrong  
  
The blues don't exist now  
Just to cleanse your soul  
They were made to wake you up  
Not to dig a hole  
  
You can cover me in roses,  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future I don't know  
I am just here to watch the river flow  
  
Solo

I can see the breakdown coming  
Like a twisted wreck  
Let's save ourselves the sorrow  
Before we hit the deck  
  
It's something of a tragedy  
It would make you weep  
When you kiss your love goodnight  
Now I see why lovers leap  
You can cover me in roses,  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows,  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future  
I don't know  
I am just here to watch  
The river flow  
  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future  
I don't know  
I am just here to watch  
The river flow  
  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow
