You want commitment, and take a look into these eyes.  
They burn with fire, Yeah, until the end of time.  
And I would do anything, I'd beg, I'd steal,  
I'd die to have you in theses arms tonight.  
  
Baby I want you like the roses want the rain,  
You know I need you like a poet needs the pain.  
And I would give anything. My blood, my love, my life.  
If you were in these arms tonight.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,  
I'd get down on my knees for you.  
And make everything alright,  
If you were in these arms.  
I'd love you, I'd please you,  
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.  
And love you till the end of time,  
if you were in these arms tonight.  
Oh, yeah.  
  
We stare at the sun, and we made a promise.  
A promise this world would never blind us.  
And these were our words.  
Our words were our songs.  
Our songs are our prayers.  
These prayers keep me strong, and I still believe.  
If you were in these arms.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,  
I'd get down on my knees for you.  
And make everything alright,  
If you were in these arms.  
I'd love you, I'd please you,  
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.  
And love you till the end of time,  
if you were in these arms tonight.  
  
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room.  
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume.  
Everything here reminds me of you.  
There's nothing I wouldn't do.  
And these were our words, they keep me strong, baby.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,  
I'd get down on my knees for you.  
And make everything alright,  
If you were in these arms.  
I'd love you, I'd please you,  
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you.  
And love you till the end of time,  
if you were in these arms tonight.  
  
If you were in these arms  
Baby, like the roses need the rain.  
Like the seasons need to change.  
Like the seasons need to change.
