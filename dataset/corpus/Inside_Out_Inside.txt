I want you to stay with me.  
To spend every day with me.  
I want you to be more than just a friend.  
I want you to let me in.  
Although you're above me.  
I want you to love me.  
I want you to need me.  
Take my hand and lead me to you.  
Inside your heart,  
Inside your soul,  
'Cause inside my mind,  
You're all I find.  
My every thought,  
My every heartbeat is beating for you.  
I pay my devotion.  
To the one who controls my emotions.  
You are my divine religion.  
I offer complete devotion to you.  
So will you accept me?  
And let happen what could be.  
Just put some faith in destiny.  
And take a chance on me.  
Inside my heart,  
Inside my soul,  
'Cause inside your mind,  
I want you to find.  
Your every thought,  
Your every heartbeat is beating for me.  
Inside your(my) heart,  
Inside your(my) soul,  
'Cause inside my(your) mind,  
You're all I find(I want you to find),  
My(Your) every thought,  
My(Your) every heartbeat is beating for you(me).  
Inside my(your) heart,  
Inside my(your) soul,  
'Cause inside your(my) mind,  
I want you to find(You're all I find),  
Your(My) every thought,  
Your(My) every heartbeat is beating for me(you).  
You're All I Find. You're All I Find.
