  
Adam lives in theory  
Trying to turn stone into bread  
Masquerading like he got it figured out  
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head  
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt  
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices  
Praying to the alter of himself  
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious  
Like he's got all the light, and no one else  
He takes the unsuspected  
'cause he knows they're not connected  
And he shows them how to be just as he is  
Virtually real, and commercially appealed  
To the lust of all the people where he lives  
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed  
Wanting to be intellectual  
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day  
And now she thinks that she's bisexual  
Caught up in emotion  
Burning up in her devotion  
To the king of exploitaion in the field  
She handed him her virtue  
'cause he told her "I won't hurt you"  
So she lay with him to see how good it feels  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication  
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying  
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head  
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment  
'cause everything appears to be the same  
They entertain suggestion,  
Next time just use protection  
Desiring to cover up their shame  
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes  
To the very antidote to their dilemma  
Burning in their lust,  
Both of them were dealt to us  
Destroying the original agenda  
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie  
They exhausted every possible conclusion,  
They can't even entertain the solution,  
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution  
Hiding from the truth,  
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation  
When confronted, blamed his wife  
Giving birth to carnal life  
Refusing to acknowledge what he done  
Now if we can agree with who created us to be  
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes  
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception  
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified  
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you  
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,  
To this decaying social system  
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go  
If we love him like we say we do,  
He will try us  
Just don't regress,  
Or slip into hopelessness  
Once he's satisfied his love,  
He won't deny us,  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now  
And then he'll tell us,  
What, what we gonna do now  
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
