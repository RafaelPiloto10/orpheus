I want to fly into your sun  
Need faith to make me numb  
Live like a teenage christ  
I'm a saint, got a date with suicide  
  
Oh mary, mary  
To be this young is oh so scary  
Mary, mary  
To be this young I'm oh so scared  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
  
Spin my way out of hell, there's nothing left this soul to sell  
  
Live fast and die you too  
How many times to do this for you?  
How many times to do this for you?  
  
Mary, mary  
To be this young I'm oh so scared  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
You never said forever, could ever hurt like this  
  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
Long hard road, out of hell  
  
I wanna live, I wanna love  
But it's a long hard road, out of hell  
  
Sell my soul for anything, anything but you  
Sell my soul for anything, anything but you
