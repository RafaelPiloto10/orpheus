If you want to make believe  
There's nothing up my sleeve  
I'm a man as man can be  
As you can plainly see  
  
Don't want to see no tears  
Eliminate your fears  
When you think you've seen it all, baby  
  
You can't believe your eyes, what you heard weren't lies  
My love is too much to hold, too much to hold  
Much to much  
  
I'm someone you can't fight  
I'm plain in size  
You can't believe your eyes  
What you heard were not lies  
I'm too much to hold  
I can't be bought or sold  
I'm far more than a man  
I'm gonna make you understand  
I'm larger than a life size man  
  
And you can't believe your eyes, what you heard weren't lies  
My love is too much to hold, too much to hold  
  
My love is larger than life, ooh larger than life  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is too much to hold, it can't be sold, oh no  
  
You can't believe your eyes, what you heard weren't lies  
My love is too much to hold, too much to hold  
  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is too much to hold, it can't be sold, oh no  
I'm larger than a life size man  
  
My love is larger than life, larger than life  
My love is larger than life, ooh larger than life  
My love is too much to hold, it can't be sold, oh no
