It's summer nights!  
Yeah,  
  
Come on ladies  
It's time to pop that top  
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock  
We went crazy cooped all winter long  
And school is out, so let's get it on  
Flip flop tans and some white sand  
I know the perfect spot  
  
Well the sunset better set soon  
So we can get in the mood  
Things start getting all heated up  
When it starts getting cool, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Summer nights  
Everybody, are you with me?  
Let that igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise  
Summer nights  
Everybody's feeling sexy  
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights  
Come on.  
  
Oh, oh yeah.  
  
Now fellas, you better watch your step  
Don't let them teeny french bikinis  
Make you loose your breath  
Back to the ladies  
Ya'll keep doing ya'lls thing  
Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream  
  
The sun is getting low  
There it goes, here we go  
Here comes the moon, yeah  
Things start getting all heated up  
When it starts getting cool, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoah,  
Oh,  
  
It's a party down in,  
Padre Big bonfire on the beach  
It's Coronas in Daytona y'all  
Where it's wild and it's free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Summer nights  
Everybody, are you with me?  
Let that igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise  
Summer nights  
Everybody's feeling sexy  
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights  
  
Yeah, oh are you ready?  
Are you ready?  
Are you ready?  
For some summer nights  
  
Yeah baby  
Summer nights  
It's summer nights  
Come on
