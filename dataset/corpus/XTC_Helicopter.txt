Oh heli Oh heli  
I'm crouching here with a telescope in hand  
Looking across our lego land  
I really think it's about time that she came down  
She a laughing giggly whirlybird  
She got to be obscene to be obheard  
I really think its about time that she came down  
  
And I object to all the air male that she pick up  
The air male that she pick up  
The air male that she pick up  
  
When she's up there twirling round  
Just like a helicopter - copter  
She's landing on the town  
It's about time that I stopped her - stopped her  
When she's up there twirling round  
Just like a helicopter - copter  
Oh heli - Oh heli  
  
Now she's away from convent she's gone wild  
Grown from a nice young lady to a child  
I really think its about time that she came down  
She a laughing giggly whirlybird  
She got to be obscene to be obheard  
I really think it's about time that she came down
