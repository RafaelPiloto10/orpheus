[Chorus:]  
She is cryin', she is cryin'.  
She's been cryin' all night long.  
She's been cryin' for her one and only son.  
  
She will weep, she will moan.  
She will moan the night away.  
She will weep and moan until the break of day.  
  
I had called for the doctor,  
But the doctor can't be found.  
So what could I do but sit and look around?  
  
Oh Lord, won't you hear,  
Won't you hear me when I pray.  
Please send this girl her one and only son.  
  
She is cryin', she is cryin'.  
She is cryin' the whole night long.  
She is cryin' for her one and only son.
