I'm just arriving in the city  
And there's music on my mind  
Lookin' for my destination and  
My home is far behind  
'cause it's a long road ahead  
And you can make it in the end  
And I'm gonna make it with my friends  
And I'm tryin'  
It took me sometime to see it  
Now I'm looking through this world  
And it's gonna take some time before  
I get back, help me girl  
'cause you can make it if you try  
You gotta lay it on the line  
And everything will be fine if you try  
Sittin' smokin' just a thinkin'  
Is an easy thing to do  
We gotta keep on trying for  
The feelin' to come through  
And it's a lonely way to live  
You gotta take it, you gotta live  
If you mistake it, just try again  
And I'm trying, yeah!  
Got to keep on trying  
Ah, we got to keep on trying  
Yeah I'm trying.... etc..
