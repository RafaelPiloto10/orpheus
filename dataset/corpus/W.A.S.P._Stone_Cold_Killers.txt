Think about the sorrow  
You brought  
Think of all the horror  
You made  
Lying to a world  
That you wrought  
Dying for the world - oh  
That you made  
  
What'd you get for  
Souls that you bought  
The bloody dead in the trades  
Don't never blame  
The souls that you lost - on  
The whores of Babylon  
That you laid  
  
Johnny get your guns  
You'll need all those prophets you pay  
Oh yeah Johnny get your guns  
I've come to kill the god that you made  
  
Im gonna murder supeman  
Murder superman  
Stone cold killer's what I am  
Your widowmaking ones come  
You can't hide  
I'm gonna murder superman  
Murder superman  
I got a heart breaker in my hands  
Yeah here I come  
Oh - You're gonna die  
  
Your lying messiah you know isn't real  
How will you die fo the one that you kneel  
Better get your guns  
I'm gonna kill your god  
My God will kill your god
