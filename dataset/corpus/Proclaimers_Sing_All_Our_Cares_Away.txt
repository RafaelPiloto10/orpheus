Mary loves the grouse  
Hides the bottles 'round the house  
She watches chat shows and the soaps  
Brokenhearted but she copes  
Michael's out of work  
Feels he's sinking in the murk  
He's unshaven and a mess  
Finds it hard some days to dress  
Stevie smashed the delf  
'Cause he can't express himself  
He's consumed by rage  
Like his father at his age  
Rita's little child  
Has a lovely little smile  
But this means nothing to her father  
Because he's never even seen her  
And we sing, sing all our cares away  
And we live to fight another day  
Joey's off the gear  
He's been clean for half a year  
He gets bored out of his mind  
But he's trying to toe the line  
Maggie's in a chair  
'Twas joyriding put her there  
She puts the kettle on the boil  
And she's always got a smile  
And we sing, sing all our cares away  
And we live to fight another day  
Yeah, we sing, sing all our cares away  
And we live to love another day  
We grow strong from it all  
We grow strong or we fall  
We grow strong from it all  
We grow strong or we fall  
And we sing all our cares away
