That day, That day  
What a mess what a marvel  
I walked into that cloud again  
And I lost myself  
And I'm sad, sad, sad  
Small, alone, scared  
Craving purity  
A fragile mind and a gentle spirit  
  
That day, That day,  
What a marvelous mess  
This is all that I can do  
I'm done to be me  
Sad, scared, small, alone, beautiful  
It's supposed to be like this  
I accept everything  
It's supposed to be like this  
  
That day, That day  
I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain, sadness  
Scared, small, climbing, crawling  
Towards the light  
And it's all that I see and  
I'm tired and I'm right  
And I'm wrong  
And it's beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
What a mess, what a marvel  
We're all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And it's okay  
And I'm small and I'm divine  
And it's beautiful  
And it's coming  
And it's already here  
And it's absolutely perfect  
  
That day, That day  
When everything was a mess  
And everything was in place  
And there's too much hurt  
Sad, small, scared, alone  
And everyone's a cynic  
And it's hard and it's sweet  
But it's supposed to be like this  
  
That day, That day  
When I sat in the sun  
And I thought and I cried  
Cause I'm sad, scared, small  
Alone, strong  
And I'm nothing and I'm true  
Only a brave man can break through  
And it's all okay  
Yeah, it's okay  
  
That day, That day  
I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain, sadness  
Scared, small, climbing, crawling  
Towards the light  
And it's all that I see and  
I'm tired and I'm right  
And I'm wrong  
And it's beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
What a mess, what a marveleous mess  
We're all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And it's okay  
And I'm small and I'm divine  
And it's beautiful  
And it's coming  
And it's already here  
And it's absolutely perfect  
  
That day, That day  
That day, That day  
  
That day, That day  
When I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain, sadness  
Scared, small, climbing, crawling  
Towards the light  
And it's all that I see and  
I'm tired and I'm right  
And I'm wrong  
And it's beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
What a mess, what a marveleous mess  
We're all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And it's okay  
And I'm small and I'm divine  
And it's beautiful  
And it's coming  
And it's already here  
And it's absolutely perfect  
  
That day, That day  
That day, That day  
That day, That day  
That day, That day  
  
So sweet, can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)  
Are you here?  
Are you with me?  
I can feel it  
And its beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
That day, absolutely perfect
