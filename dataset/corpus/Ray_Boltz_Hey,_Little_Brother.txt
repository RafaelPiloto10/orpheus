Hey, Little Brother  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Chorus:  
Hey, little brother, welcome back home  
It's good to see you again  
Hey, little brother, welcome back home  
To your family and your friends  
Chorus  
Now you do not know  
What your Father's been through  
At night He would call out your name  
Then for hours untold  
He would stare down the road  
Praying you'd come home again  
Chorus  
I must confess I was quite envious  
When I heard what Father planned to do  
But after I talked to Him  
I realized I had been  
Almost as far from home as you  
I was almost as far from home as you, so  
  
Chorus  
Oh, dear brother run into my arms  
And tell me you are home to stay  
For there is no other Father like ours  
And we're so glad you're here today  
Yes, we're so glad you're here today  
Chorus (repeat)
