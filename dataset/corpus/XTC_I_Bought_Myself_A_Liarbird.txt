I bought myself a liarbird  
He came with free drinks just to blur  
The lies falling out like rain  
On an average English summer's afternoon  
  
I bought myself a new notebook  
Sharpened my guitar and went to look  
If this biz was just as bongo as the liarbird made out  
  
All he would say  
Is 'I can make you famous'  
All he would say  
All he would say  
'Just like a household name' is  
All he would say  
  
Methinks world is for you  
Made of what you believe  
If it's false or if it's true  
You can read it in your bible  
Or on the back of this record sleeve  
  
I bought myself a liarbird  
Things got more and more absurd  
It changed to a cuckoo  
And expanded filling up with all I gave  
  
I bought myself a big mistake  
He grew too greedy, bough will break  
And then we will find that liarbirds  
Are really flightless on their own  
  
All he would say  
Is 'I can make you famous'  
All he would say  
All he would say  
'Just like a household name' is  
All he would say  
  
Methinks world is for you  
There's no handing it back  
If it's false or it's true  
You can read it in your prayer book  
Or on the side of a cornflake pack  
  
I gave away a liarbird  
A couple less drinks and now I've heard  
The truth shining out like sun  
On an average English winter's afternoon
