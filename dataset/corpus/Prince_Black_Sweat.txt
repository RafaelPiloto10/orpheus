Workin', workin' up a black sweat [Repeat: x4]  
  
I don't want to take my clothes off,  
But I do.  
I don't want to turn nobody on,  
Unless it's you.  
I don't want to dance to hard, baby  
But this is a groove (yes it is! Fonky)  
I'm hot, and I don't care who knows it,  
I got a job to do (think I ain't, come on)  
  
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat  
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat  
I'm workin', oooh!  
Workin' up a black sweat  
Workin', workin' up a black sweat  
  
I don't want to hurt your pride,  
But I got to (got to hurt 'em, gonna hurt 'em)  
You better take your woman and hide, (hide)  
I'm about to (come, what you gotta do boy! got to, got to)  
Honey what's really good (sugar what's really good)  
Break you off like you knew I would  
I got a brand new dance  
I got a brand new dance  
And it's called the  
  
Workin', workin' up a black sweat  
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat  
I'm workin'  
Workin' up a black sweat  
Workin', workin' up a black sweat  
Workin' up a black sweat  
Workin'  
  
Breakdown  
You can act hard if you want to  
This groove will make you sweet  
You be screamin' like a white lady  
When I count two three  
One, two, three!  
  
Workin', workin' up a black sweat  
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat  
I'm workin', workin' up a black  
Oh, workin' up a black, hey!  
Black sweat.
