Where are you this moment?  
Only in my dreams.  
You're missing, but you're always  
A heartbeat from me.  
I'm lost now without you,  
I don't know where you are.  
I keep watching, I keep hoping,  
But time keeps us apart.  
  
Is there a way I can find you,  
Is there a sign I should know,  
Is there a road I could follow  
To bring you back home?  
  
Winter lies before me  
Now you're so far away.  
In the darkness of my dreaming  
The light of you will stay.  
  
If I could be close beside you  
If I could be where you are  
If I could reach out and touch you  
And bring you back home  
Is there a way I can find you  
Is there a sign I should know  
Is there a road I can follow  
To bring you back home to me?
