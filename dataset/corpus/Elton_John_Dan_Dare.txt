Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it  
If he'd been here now? Holy cow  
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars  
'Cause I don't have foresight to see  
If we still be together in the twenty first  
In the twenty first century [Incomprehensible]  
He's our flyin' ace, pilot of the future  
In an endless space, holy cow  
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size  
'Cause I don't have the energy  
To be cat and mouse for the champions  
For the champions of destiny, oh no  
So long Captain Dan  
I fail to see what motivates your hands  
Goodbye restless night  
You know I loved Dan Dare  
But I couldn't make his flight  
So long, so long, yeah  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
So long Captain Dan  
I fail to see what motivates your hands  
Goodbye restless night  
You know I loved Dan Dare  
But I couldn't make his flight  
So long, so long  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
Doesn't know it, doesn't know it  
But I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
No, he doesn't know it, no, he doesn't know it  
No, he doesn't know it, but I liked the Mekon  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
No, he doesn't know it, no, he doesn't know it  
No, he doesn't know it  
Dan Dare doesn't know it  
No, he doesn't know it, no, he doesn't know it  
No, he doesn't know it
