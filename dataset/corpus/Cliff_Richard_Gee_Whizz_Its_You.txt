Well, who's that a-walkin' down the street  
Pickin' up those dainty little feet  
Who's the one that catches my eye  
Everytime she passes by - gee whizz it's you  
  
Ever since we said goodbye, all because of a little white lie,  
Let me tell you why we parted, listen now to what my heart says,  
  
Chorus  
Gee whizz it's you, you're the one that's makin' me blue  
Gee whizz it's you, you're the one who can't be true  
  
Little darlin' won't you hear my plea  
Won't you please come back to me,  
We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says,  
Ummmm - gee whizz it's you..........  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
Chorus  
  
Little darlin' won't you hear my plea  
Won't you please come back to me,  
We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says,  
Ummmm - gee whizz it's you..........  
  
Gee whizz it's you  
  
Gee whizz it's you  
  
(Fade Out)
