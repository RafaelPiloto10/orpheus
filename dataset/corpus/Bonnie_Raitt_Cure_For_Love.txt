You bring me roses  
You give me kisses  
You bring me moons and stars  
That shine so high up in the sky  
My heart is beating wild and crazy  
  
Hope that I can find  
A cure for this love  
Could be you want me  
Could be you care  
Could be the words you say,  
Are things I just want to hear  
  
You me nervous, got me shaking  
Maybe I can find  
A cure for this love  
La la la la  
  
Doctor, doctor  
Give me healing, so I can stop this feeling  
It's getting so much stronger  
And I just can't go on much longer  
  
Doctor please  
Find me a way out of love  
When the phone rings  
And no one answers  
  
The letters comeback saying  
"Lover cannot be found"  
Don't go looking, don't bother searching  
You see it's 'cause your baby  
Found herself a cure for love  
La la la la
