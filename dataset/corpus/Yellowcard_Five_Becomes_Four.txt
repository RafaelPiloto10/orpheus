Needed some time  
So I could find  
A little strength to redefine  
What I've become  
What I have done  
I never asked to be the one  
  
I'm riding it out  
This storm that you brought in  
Bringing it down, only around  
For you I go again  
It's got to be easy to see  
What everyone takes out of me  
Knocking me down, dragging me out  
How did you end up in that crowd?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did you run away? Did you fall apart?  
Do you see yourself for what you are?  
Will you be looking for it anymore  
When five becomes four?  
When you're all alone with the melody  
Do you close your eyes and think of me?  
Will you still hear me singing anymore  
When five becomes four?  
  
Try and put aside  
Your history and pride  
Maybe for one moment in time  
We'll all be on your side  
The story goes, nobody knows  
What it was like when you were through  
Someone who cared out in the air  
It went and crashed down anywhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember the line "never say die"?  
You were the reason I survived  
Where did you go? I need to know  
I waited here, you never showed  
It's gonna be harder for me  
I can't forgive so many things  
When you weren't there, I was around  
Why would you try and hurt me now?  
Just tell me why!  
Just tell me why!  
  
(Did you run away?)  
(Did you run away?)  
  
Did you run away? Did you fall apart?  
Do you see yourself for what you are?  
Will you be looking for it anymore  
When five becomes four?  
When you are all alone with the melody  
Do you close your eyes and think of me?  
Will you still hear me singing anymore  
When five becomes four?  
When five becomes four...  
When five becomes four...
