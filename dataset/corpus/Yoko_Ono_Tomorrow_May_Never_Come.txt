Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Yesterday may linger forever  
Today may never be found  
Tomorrow may never come  
Tomorrow may never come  
  
Yesterday may haunt us forever  
Today may pass in fear  
Tomorrow my never come  
Tomorrow may never come  
  
All we have is you and I  
(All we have, you and I)  
Feeling the wind and the sky  
(Feel the wind, the sky)  
Reach me, touch me, hold me  
(Hold me)  
Hold me while my lips are still soft  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Yesterday may scar us forever  
Today may never be found  
Tomorrow may never come  
(Never, never, never come)  
Tomorrow may never come  
  
All we have is you and I  
(All we have, you and I)  
Feeling the wind and the sky  
(Feel the wind, the sky)  
Reach me, touch me, hold me  
(Hold me)  
Hold me while my lips are still soft  
  
Reach me  
(Reach me)  
Touch me  
(Touch me)  
Reach me  
(Reach me)  
Touch me  
  
Hold me, hold me, hold me  
(Hold me)  
Hold me while my lips are still warm  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
