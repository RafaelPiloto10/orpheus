Here it comes, Here it comes,  
I can feel the hills exploding  
Exploding gracefully  
Burning up the freeway  
Here it comes  
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble  
Beautiful gets into beautiful trouble  
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.  
Oh baby burn  
  
Fast die younger  
Burns rubber  
Useless rockers  
From England  
Good times  
Had by all  
Just swallow your guilt and your crutches  
Blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal  
Interstate fire walk staright down the middle,  
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you  
Oh baby burn
