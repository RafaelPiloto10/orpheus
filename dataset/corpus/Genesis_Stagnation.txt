To Thomas S.Eiselberg, a very rich man, who was wise  
Enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself  
Many miles beneath the ground. as the only surviving  
Member of the human race, he inherited the whole world.  
  
Stagnation  
  
Here today the red sky tells his tale,  
But the only listening eyes are mine  
There is peace amongst the hills,  
And the night will cover all my pride.  
Blest are they who smile from bodies free,  
Seems to me like any other crowd  
Who are waiting to be saved.  
  
Wait, there is still time for washing in the pool,  
Wash away the past  
Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above,  
Smiling at my tears.  
Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home,  
Keep outside the night.  
The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead,  
Somehow  
  
And each will find a home,  
And there will still be time,  
For loving my friend  
You are there  
And will I wait for ever, beside the silent mirror  
And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds  
And slimy water.  
  
I want to sit down.  
I want to take a drink of water  
I want a drink  
I want a drink.  
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat.  
I want a drink.  
I want a drink.  
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts.  
I want a drink.  
  
Then let us drink  
Then let us smile  
Then let us go
