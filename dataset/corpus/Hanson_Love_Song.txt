The wind--it blows through the trees  
Claiming those innocent leaves  
And the thunder rolls these crashing seas  
Like a tender kiss holds this heart in me  
  
[Chorus]  
In this lifelong love song  
You can love right, you can love wrong  
In this love song, you can love wrong  
But if you love wrong, it doesn't mean love's gone  
  
Mary was a young girl with a young girl's heart  
And all I can remember is I loved her from the start  
I was hers forever, she was mine too  
But something's wrong 'cause now she's gone  
Tell me, what did I do?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, and it doesn't mean love's gone  
Just because you're feeling low  
And it doesn't mean love's gone  
'Cause you feel like you want to let go  
See, no one wrote in this book of love  
That we'd always know  
I wish someone would have told me before  
  
We talked about love a million times it seems  
The words come out of our lips  
Like we forget what it means  
And we said we'd be together till death do us part  
But we said those words with only half our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wish someone would have told me  
I wish someone would have told me before
