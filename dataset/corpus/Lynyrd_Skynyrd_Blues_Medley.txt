I got a sweet little angel mama  
Lord and I love the way she spreads her wings  
Spreads her wings Lord  
All around my everything

Lord ya know she gave me a 20 dollar bill  
I asked my ol' lady for a nickel people  
Lord ya know she give me a 20 dollar bill  
And I asked her for a little shot of liquor  
No she bought me a whiskey still  
And I bought you a new Ford  
Say you want a Cadillac  
Bought ya a ten dollar dinner  
You said thanks for the snack  
I let you live in my penthouse  
And you called it a shack  
Gave you seven younguns  
Now you wanna give 'em all back

Or ever hopin', ever hopin', ever hopin' to come back  
Cause it's all over, it's all over lady  
Mama you can bet your sweet life on
