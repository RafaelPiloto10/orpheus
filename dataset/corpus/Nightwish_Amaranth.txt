Baptized with a perfect name  
The doubting one by heart  
Alone, without himself  
  
War between him and the day  
Need someone to blame  
In the end little he can do alone  
  
You believe but what you see  
You receive bu what you give  
  
Caress the one  
That never-fading rain  
In your heart  
The tears of snow-white sorrow  
Caress the one  
The hiding Amaranth  
In the land of the daybreak  
  
Apart from the wandering path  
In this brief flight of time  
We reach for the ones who ever dare  
  
You believe but what you see  
You receive but what you give  
  
Caress the one  
That never-fading rain  
In your heart  
The tears of snow-white sorrow  
Caress the one  
The hiding Amaranth  
In the land of the daybreak  
  
Reaching, searching  
For something untouched  
Hearing voices of the never-fading calling  
Calling  
  
Caress the one  
The never-fading rain  
In your heart  
The tears of snow-white sorrow  
Caress the one  
The hiding Amaranth  
In the land of the daybreak
