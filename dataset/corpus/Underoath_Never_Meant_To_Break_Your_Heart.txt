Tears run down my face  
Just like the last  
No different from yesterday  
Sick from the mirror  
Do these prayers feel sincere  
The dirt never washes clear  
You were good, so good  
I grew to love your lies  
Until I put you in the past  
Love was lust until he revealed  
The man behund the mask  
Will the scars go away  
In this world I have no place  
Forgive me Jesus this time I cry  
I rip my heart out to give to you  
Alone it never did me any good  
Hold me close, wash my mind  
Destroy the me that lives inside
