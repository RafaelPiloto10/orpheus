Where have you been?  
I was out with Pat  
Was she shootin' shit?  
Yeah, but I played it off legit  
  
Talkin' to some Joe,  
Hangin' out, shootin' shit  
Tries to tell me somethin'  
I play it off legit  
  
How did you handle it?  
I played it off legit  
  
So pleasant when the sails of the seas of Orion gently slip  
No more need for God's sorrow  
I just play it off legit  
  
Dude's hounding this bitch, okay  
I'm checkin' out the shit laughin' (yeah)  
Later on I'll fuck her (oh man)  
She knows I'm legit  
(She does? I didn't know that)  
(That's right, from the start)  
(Bitch was houndin' and shit)  
(Tell me about that sexy scorpion)  
A sexy scorpion that stings her with wit  
I play it off legit because I know I'm legit  
(That's right, I know you're legit)  
(I'm legit, played it off cool)  
  
My ma bought me a cool shirt  
When I wear it, I'm the shit  
I'm really not that legit  
My mom bought it  
(She wasn't playing it off legit either)  
(Nah, she knows I'm legit)  
(Did you clap when you saw her?)  
I clapped when I saw her  
When I found her, you split  
When I'm on the go, you know I'm legit  
  
(I mean, I was really legit, up on the go that night)  
(Ah you were, know I'm legit)  
(You know I'm legit, go)  
(Do it, keep it going, tell 'em about Joe)  
  
Talkin' to some Joe  
Hangin' out, shootin' shit (right)  
Tries to tell me somethin'  
I play it off legit (that's right)  
You want to hear about the scorpion?
