I don't like you  
But I love you  
Seems like I'm always thinking of you  
Oh, oh, oh,  
You treat me badly  
I love you madly  
You've really got a hold on me  
You've really got a hold on me  
  
I don't want you,  
But I need you  
Don't wanna kiss you  
But I need you  
Oh, oh, oh  
You do me wrong now  
My love is strong now  
You've really got a hold on me  
You've really got a hold on me  
  
I love you and all that I want you to do  
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me  
  
Don't wanna leave you  
don't wanna stay here  
Don't wanna spend another day here  
Oh, I just don't fit now  
I just can quit now  
You've really got a hold on me  
You've really got a hold on me, baby  
  
I love you and all that I want you to do  
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
