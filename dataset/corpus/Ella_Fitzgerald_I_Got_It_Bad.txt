The poets say that all who love are blind  
But I'm in love and I know what time it is  
The good book says, "Go seek and ye shall find"  
Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!  
My life is just like the weather  
It changes with the hours  
When he's near I'm fair and warmer  
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers  
An emotion like the ocean  
It's either sink or swim  
When a woman loves a man  
Like I love him  
Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around  
I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out  
He don't love me like I love him  
No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good  
So bad, so bad  
I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions  
Tell me to save my tears  
I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you  
Lord above me make him love me the way he should  
Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood  
The things I tell my pillow  
No woman should  
I got it bad, bad so bad and that ain't good
