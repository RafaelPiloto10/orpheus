Something's goin' on  
I don't know what it is  
But my phone just rang and I didn't get no call  
No call.  
Just waiting here  
  
Abilene, it's got a lot of what you don't need  
It's got lots of space  
Still nothing seems misplaced  
You've got a face  
You are spacey  
  
You got to take it as it comes to you  
Don't need no act of contemplation  
Just keep it off your wasteful way for now  
It's not you who has got to change  
It's not your way at all  
It's got to be you  
  
It's got to be you  
The look in your eyes,  
the feel of your body close to me  
It's got to be you  
Who tells me the world spin away without love  
  
You  
Reason, oh, reason for being once more together  
It's got to be you.  
  
It's got to be you  
The look in your eyes,  
the feel of your body close to me  
It's got to be you  
Who tells me the world spin away without love  
  
You  
Reason, oh, reason for being once more together  
It's got to be you.  
It's got to be you.  
It's got to be you.  
It's got to be you.
