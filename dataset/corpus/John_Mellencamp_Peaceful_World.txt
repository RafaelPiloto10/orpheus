Come on baby take a ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is as cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
People know this world is a wreck  
We're sick and tired of being politically correct  
If I see through it now but I didn't at first  
The hypocrites made it worse and worse  
Lookin' down their noses at what people say  
These are just words and words are okay  
It's what you do and not what you say  
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me

Racism lives in the U.S. today  
Better get hip to what Martin Luther King had to say  
I don't want my kids being brought up this way  
Hatred to each other is not okay  
Well I'm not a preacher just a singer son  
But I can see more work to be done  
It's what you do and not what you say  
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me

The money's good and the work is okay  
Looks like everything is rollin our way  
"Til you gotta look the devil in the eye  
You know that bastard's one big lie  
So be careful with your heart and what you love  
Make sure that it was sent from above  
It's what you do and not what you say  
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Lay back the top and ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah
