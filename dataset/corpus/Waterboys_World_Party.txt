Well it's got nothing to do with anything that is real  
You just believe in it and it's true  
You can sooth like an angel or sigh like a saint  
You can dream it and see it through  
You will live to see a sea of lights  
Sparking on the face of a pearl  
Climb your own peak  
Find a new streak  
  
Get yourself along to the world party (party!)  
Now you've been building for yourself a cool place in the sand  
You're thinking that it's mighty fine  
You've got dust in your eyeballs, you got mud in your mouth  
But it's your head, it ain't mine  
I've got a madman of my own to contend with  
Cursing in the cave of my skull  
Turn the other cheek  
Find a new streak  
  
Get yourself along to the world party (party!)  
Well I heard a rumour of a golden age  
Somewhere back along the line  
Maybe I dreamed it in a whisper or  
Heard it in a spell  
It was something to do with the sign of the times  
And the only thing that I remember  
Is a summer like a pretty girl  
Who shimmers and shines  
Moving in time  
Shaking to the beat of the heart of the world  
  
Party (party! party! party! party! party! party! party! party! party!)
