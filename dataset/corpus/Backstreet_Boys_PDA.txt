Intimacy's  
Fresh from my dreams  
Over a triple X movie screen  
I couldn't care less about being seen  
A higher self esteem if you're on me?  
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)  
I say baby do you think  
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth  
But instead it just rottens me  
Spoiled crazy  
  
I said,  
Public display of affection  
(Gotta make 'em)  
Pointing in that direction  
(Watch me, watch me)  
Public display of affection  
Makes them wish they had it this way  
  
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies  
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty  
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
Remember at the beach we brought the sheets  
We were harassed by police  
Good thing we didn't go too deep  
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams  
I just need you in my reach  
Baby your suspense can be intense  
It's got me convinced, oh yeah  
You're the fingers to my instrument  
  
Public display of affection  
(Gotta make 'em)  
Pointing in that direction  
(Watch me, watch me)  
Public display of affection  
Makes them wish they had it this way  
  
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies  
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty  
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
From the lobby to the patio  
(Boy you're so crazy)  
And we're so compatible  
From the Starbucks to the Navho  
(Hmm, nasty)  
And we're so compatible  
  
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies  
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty  
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
I wanna run  
(I want your P-D-A)  
All over your body  
(I, I, I want your P-D-A)  
I wanna run  
(I want your P-D-A)  
All over your body  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
I want your P-D-A  
(That's right)  
Public display of affection  
Mmm I want your PDA
