When I was young, old man sat me on his knee  
He told me if I had a dream, I could be what I want to be  
Now life goes on a voice echoes in the wind  
It's telling me to carry on, now I know that it's him  
  
[Chorus]  
He said whoa, watch out boy  
Don't go messing with your life cause it ain't no toy  
Lord help ya to carry life's load  
It could all pass you by down on dead man's road  
  
Now I got a good woman  
Ya know she's looking out for me  
And if I get a little blind ya know she helps me to see  
But I gotta keep running because they're catching up to me  
I think I hear that voice again, this time it says to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was young old man sat me on his knee  
He told me if I had a dream I could be what I want to be  
Now life goes on a voice echoes in the wind  
It's telling me to carry on now I know that it's him  
  
[Chorus x2]
