Here and now  
Is the way I live  
Unafraid of  
What life gives  
And there have been times in my life  
I couldn't see a difference  
In pain or in joy  
Or in sun or in rain  
They just seem the same  
But I'm only human  
Branded by my ambitions  
But I'm going to make it  
Here and now  
Is the way I live  
With an open heart and mind  
So many intentions  
In this life I could have followed  
But one of those  
Paths must lead to your heart  
Here and Now  
Is the way I live  
Unafraid of  
What life gives  
Respect things I don't understand  
So many intentions  
In this life I could have followed  
But one of those  
Paths must lead to your heart  
Here and Now  
(Here and Now)  
Here and Now
