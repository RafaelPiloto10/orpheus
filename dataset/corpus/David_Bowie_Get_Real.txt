Oh hideous year we angels have lead  
We're dead, we're sick and hanging by thread  
Get real, get real  
You can't stop meaningful teenage cries  
From deep behind fifty year old eyes  
Get real, get real  
I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone  
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun  
Against the voice of doom failures fall all over town  
I guess I should, I feel I should, get real, get real  
What's up? What happened when I wasn't around?  
Who did what? What went down?  
Get real, get real  
Think about myself it happens to me  
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel  
Get real, get real  
I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone  
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun  
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town  
I feel I should, I guess I should, get real, get real  
Get real, get real  
The dazzle of light, the rape of life  
The seed, the curse, the jazz of life  
Get real, get real, get real
