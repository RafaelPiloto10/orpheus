She woke from a dream  
Her head was on fire  
Why was he so nervous?  
He took her to the park  
She crossed her arms  
And lowered her eyelids  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday somebody's gonna ask you  
A question that  
You should say "yes" to  
Once in your life  
Maybe tonight  
I've got a question for you  
  
She'd had no idea  
Started to cry,  
She said in a good way  
He took her by the hand  
Walked her back home  
They took the long way  
  
[Chorus]
