The night  
So young  
You could lose  
You could gain  
Your temperature's rising  
Better pull into the outside lane  
You always say you're not the jealous kind  
Then you tell all your friends that I've got one thing on my mind  
  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
I don't depend on you, I've got my own friends too  
I'll never be your wife, don't try to use me  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
  
It's cruel but it's true, I don't depend on you  
It's cruel but it's true, go back to the end of the queue
