Touching down how I climb  
Balancing dreams that he's chosen  
Northern lights on [?]  
Melting stream that was frozen  
  
Passing cars with rusted wheels  
The frame in need of a [?]  
Red sky night, that [?]  
Back when the grow was impossibly  
Working tide will come around again  
[?] is waiting in the wind  
For all your world and treasures  
There's nothing to be want  
Nothing left to measure  
It's you and me and the colour of the sun  
  
While the child wonders how  
The sky connects to the ocean  
Spinning fast, and that's now  
She's unaware of the motion  
The wise men and the fools keep taking turns  
Every day more bridges seem to burn  
With all your volts and treasures  
Would you trade them for some fun?  
What's the rise of pleasure?  
Cause you and me, you can [?]  
Watch the particles collide  
And trust the stars up in the sky!  
  
Sand that's gone, snatched by the storm  
Are the poles really shifting?  
Gypsy rains wash all the planes  
[?] dreams I still drifting  
The best the times get still somehow be found!  
Even the worst of features will never let you down  
For all your world, the treasures  
For your battles lost in one  
Nothing left to measure  
It's you and me and the colour of the sun
