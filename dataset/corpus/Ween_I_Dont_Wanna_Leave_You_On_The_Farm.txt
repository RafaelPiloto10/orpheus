I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to go  
Oh, just so ya know  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
  
Days go by and I'm still high  
But you know I'm thinkin' about you  
Corn's turned brown, leaves fall to the ground  
It's a sound that reminds me of you  
  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to go  
Oh, just so ya know  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
  
No telephone to call you at home  
I'm alone on the throne  
Go get somethin', hey, thanks for nothin'  
I'll keep truckin' and gettin' myself stoned  
  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to go  
Oh, just so ya know  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
  
Days go by and I'm still high  
But you know I'm thinkin' about you  
Corn's turned brown, leaves fall to the ground  
It's a sound that sticks like glue
