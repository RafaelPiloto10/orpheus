I've got my hope set high  
That's why I came tonight  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light.  
  
I've got my hope set high  
That's why I came tonight  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
And I can do my best  
And pray to the Father  
But the one thing I oughta know by now  
  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
You know that when it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
I've got my hope set high  
And like a star at night  
Out of the deepest dark  
It shines the purest light.  
  
I've got my hope set high  
Beyond the wrong and right  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
'Cause I can do my best  
And pray to the Father  
But the one thing I ought to know by now  
  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
Oh and when it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
Oh
