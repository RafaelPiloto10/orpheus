The slayer's arrived  
On the black horse of steel  
Trouble is coming  
Hell on two wheels  
Hide in the shadows  
Awaiting defeat  
Or live by the sword  
And choose to be free  
We say retribution  
We say vengeance is bliss  
We say revolution  
With a cast iron fist  
Coming down the road  
Watching every move  
Kicking in the doors  
Taking what we choose  
Anarchy's coming to town  
A fiery invader  
Burning it down to the ground  
The Disintegrators  
Anarchy's coming  
Here it comes  
Burning it down to the ground  
The Disintegrators
