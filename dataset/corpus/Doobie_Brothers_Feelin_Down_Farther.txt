Well, the sun is shinin? a new day is here  
All the people smilin? and the sky is clear  
Not an hour wasted will I share with you  
Got to keep lovin?, mama no matter what I do  
Ooh, ooh, ooh I got to tell you  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Jesus, hear me when I sing out loud  
The echoes of my gladness fall upon the crowd  
I don't care for sadness and I don't need fear  
Hope they finally realize that the feelin? is near  
Ooh, ooh, ooh I got to tell you  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Ooh, way down low  
Ooh, way down low  
Ooh, way down low  
Ooh, way down low  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Well givin? and receivin? are all I know  
Some of you will find it and you'll probably let it show  
Only one thing that I know to be true  
Every day is different, mama and so are you  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down
