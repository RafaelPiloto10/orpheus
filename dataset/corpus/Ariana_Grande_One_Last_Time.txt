[Verse 1]  
I was a liar, I gave into the fire  
I know I should've fought it  
At least I'm being honest  
Feel like a failure cause I know that I failed you  
I should've done you better cause you don't want a liar  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I know, and I know  
And I know she gives you everything, but boy I couldn't give it to you  
And I know, and I know  
And I know that you got everything but I got nothing here without you  
  
[Chorus]  
One last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time, I promise after that I'll let you go  
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
So One last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it  
But stay with me a minute: I'll swear I'll make it worth it  
Can't you forgive me, at least just temporarily?  
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I know, and I know  
And I know she gives you everything, but boy I couldn't give it to you  
And I know, and I know, and I know That you got everything  
But I got nothing here without you  
  
[Chorus]  
So one last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time, I promise after that I'll let you go  
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
One last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
  
[Bridge]  
I know I should've fought it, At least I'm being honest  
Just stay with me a minute: I swear I'll make it worth it  
Cause I don't want to be without you  
  
[Chorus]  
So one last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time, I promise after that I'll let you go  
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
One last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
  
[Outro]  
One last time I need to be the one who takes you home
