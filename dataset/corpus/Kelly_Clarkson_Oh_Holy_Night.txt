O' Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth  
  
The thrill of hope,  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel's voices  
O' night divine  
O' night when Christ was born  
O' night divine  
O' night,  
O' night divine  
  
O' Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Oh...  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth  
  
The thrill of hope,  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder brings a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel's voices  
O' night divine  
O' night when Christ was born  
O' night divine  
O' night,  
O' night di...divine
