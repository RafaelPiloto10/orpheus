I ain't no Romeo. I'm just the man for you.  
Holding out as secrets travel, they kind of get to you.  
Everybody says that it could've been something.  
Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing.  
  
Always hearing voices swim, in your liquid sky.  
Liquid Sky  
Always hearing voices, like no more choices in disguise.  
I ain't no sacred idol or a saint pretending.  
I'll build you up.  
I'll tear you down.  
Turn you wrong side in.  
  
What am I afraid of? Everyone's listening.  
Standing on my soapbox, lost the beginning.  
  
Always hearing voices, swim, in your liquid sky.  
Liquid sky, I'm always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie.  
It's just, it's just liquid sky.  
  
I'm always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise.  
I don't know what this means.  
I'll leave it for your interpretation.  
It's just me at the edge,  
Everybody says that it could have been something.  
Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing.  
  
Always hearing voices  
Swim in your liquid sky.  
Liquid Sky, I'm always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie.  
It's just, it's just liquid sky.  
I'm always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise.  
Always hearing voices swim
