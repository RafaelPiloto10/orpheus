I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll, when it didn't cost a thing  
Stacks of scratched up 45's and taught myself how to sing  
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king  
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, burnin' it up in a smoke filled club  
Givin' your soul to the world  
  
Chorus:  
  
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, a soldier of fortune in the night  
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, when the white hot lights cut through the night  
And the sound of the thunder starts roaring  
That's when you know what you're savin' it for  
And you're feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero  
  
I owe it all to rock 'n' roll, and I wouldn't want to change a thing  
Got this old guitar strapped round my neck, and my baby waitin' in the wings  
  
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king  
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, a spark in your eyes  
A flame in your soul, givin' it all to the world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Yes you're feeling like, oh you're feeling like  
  
(chorus)  
  
(Like a rock 'n' roll hero, like a rock 'n' roll hero)
