Oh oh oh yeah  
Babe  
  
Last time I thought we had this talk  
Boy you were getting ready to leave  
I thought that baby you were done  
Cause for a while you could barely look at me  
  
This time I thought that we'd be fine  
That I'd forget the things that you said  
I tried crossing out your words  
  
But baby you can not forget the past  
Oh oh oh oh babe  
Can not forget the past  
Oh oh oh oh, Still baby (Babe)  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
The second time around  
  
We tried going back to Joe's  
That always was our favourite place  
Long rides baby by the coast  
Do you remember where we stayed  
  
Last time we where hanging out  
You were acting kind of strange  
Now it's the second time around  
I'm sorry now it's me that feels this way  
Oh oh oh oh babe  
(My heart just speaks to me)  
It's me that feels this way  
Oh oh oh babe  
  
I now you are the one that is hurting  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
I'm not sure the best way to say this  
But I can't pretend to love you no more babe  
This ferris wheel's got me crazy  
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us babe  
Not meant for us babe hey-yeah!  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
The second time around
