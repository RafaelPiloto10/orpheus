Everybody said that you'd better watch out  
Man, she's gonna turn you in  
And me, you know that I thought that I looked out  
Now look at the trouble that I'm in  
You know, you'd better -  
  
Watch out for charley's girl  
Watch out for charley's girl  
Watch out for charley's girl  
Watch out for charley's girl  
  
It happened on new year's eve  
They said everybody had to leave  
They had a warrant in their hand  
They wanted to bust the whole band  
I said if I ever see sharon again  
I'm gonna punch her face in  
You know you, you'd better -  
  
Watch out for charley's girl  
Hey, now, now  
Watch out for charley's girl  
You know she'll turn you, turn you in  
Watch out for charley's girl  
Watch out for charley's girl  
She'll turn you in you'd better, huhh -  
Watch out, you'd better -  
Watch out, you'd better -  
You'd better watch out, you'd better  
You'd better watch out for -  
Charley's girl
