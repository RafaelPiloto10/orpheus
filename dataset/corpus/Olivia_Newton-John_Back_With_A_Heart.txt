Every day the pain dies a little  
I'm not at the end but I'm way past the middle  
I know when I'm all healed up  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
Good as new or maybe better  
So glad to know that tears aren't forever  
Tears dry and soon enough  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
Doesn't mean that all my hurt is through  
But more and more I think of me  
And less and less of you  
Oh, you're hard to forget but I'm gonna do it  
Thought I would die but I'm livin' right through it  
I won't give up so don't call my bluff  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
No, it doesn't mean that all the hurt is through  
But more and more I think of me  
And less and less of you  
Every day the pain dies a little  
I'm not at the end but I'm way past the middle  
I know when I'm all healed up  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
I know when I'm all healed up  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
Ooh, ready to love
