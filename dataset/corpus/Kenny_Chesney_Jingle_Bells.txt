Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
  
Bells on bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
You know I hate the cold  
That's why I always go  
Down south to drink some rum  
On a island in the sun  
  
There's nothing like St. Croix  
With the palm trees swaying slow  
Or being there on an open dock  
When the New Year comes and goes  
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh
