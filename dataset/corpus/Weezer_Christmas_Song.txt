You told me you would be here by my side  
Warming my heart on this cold winter's night  
  
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself  
  
You told me you would bring presents and treats (K-R-O-Q CD  
Original)  
Cheering my spirits with homemade sweet meats (K-R-O-Q CD  
Original)  
  
You told me you would move heaven and earth (promo CD remix)  
Cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth (promo CD remix)  
  
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself  
  
Oh, could you ever know how much I care?  
Could you ever know that out somewhere  
There's a boy who really hurts?  
  
Since I've found you  
I've found a girl  
I've found a thorn  
I've found a queen  
Now I am warm  
  
Christmas Celebration [top]  
Christmas celebration  
And all around the nation  
Won't you stay with me tonight cause  
I'm running out of fight  
And the pagentry is such a bore  
  
Carolers are singing  
Registers Ka-chinging  
And the presents are in place  
But I'd rather eat some mace  
'cause the eggnog always makes me sick  
  
You know how the story goes  
You've seen it all before  
That man is so obese that he can't get out the door  
  
Christmas to perfection  
I'm begging for some action  
And the ringing in my ears  
Is the sound of Christmas cheer  
And they've knocked me screaming overboard
