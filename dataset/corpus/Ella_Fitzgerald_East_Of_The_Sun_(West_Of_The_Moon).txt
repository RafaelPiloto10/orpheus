East of the sun and west of the moon  
We'll build a dream house of love, dear  
Near to the sun in the day  
Near to the moon at night  
We'll live in a lovely way, dear  
Living our love in pale moonlight  
  
Just you and I, forever and a day  
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear  
East of the sun and west of the moon  
  
Just you and I, forever and a day  
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear  
East of the sun, west of the moon  
East of the sun and west of the moon
