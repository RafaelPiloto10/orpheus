Set in overdrive, makin' money on the side.  
Lookin' for some dirty action.  
Leave 'em on the floor,  
Leave 'em wantin' more.  
Use it for the prime reaction.  
  
Workin' like a dog,  
Tired cold, and bored.  
Stimulate me to satisfaction.  
Alcohol and sluts,  
Pull me from my rut,  
Second only to the attraction.  
  
You! got a lot to learn.  
Your head's up your ass!  
You! got a lot to learn.  
You got no class.  
  
No class.  
  
Take me to the top, never never stop.  
So pretty what's your name, where ya from.  
I see you like the band,  
Don't leave me with my hand,  
Stick around I'll throw you a bone.  
  
No class.  
  
Crack another beer, sit on over here.  
What I need I can't do alone.  
Think that I'm in love, sittin' in your glove,  
What's your name, here I come out, I'm done.  
  
Why don't you use your head.
