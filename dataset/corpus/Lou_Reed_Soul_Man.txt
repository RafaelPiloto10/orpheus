(written by Isaac Hayes - David Porter)  
  
Coming to you, on a dusty road  
Good loving, I got a truck load  
And when you get it, you got something  
So don't worry, 'cause I'm coming  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
  
Got what I got, the hard way  
and I'll make better, each and every day  
So honey, hey, don't you fret  
'cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
  
I was brought up, on a side street  
Learned how to love, before I could eat  
Hey, I was educated, from good, good stock  
When I start loving I just can't stop  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
  
Grab the rope, and I'll pull you in  
Give you hope, and be your only boyfriend  
Ya, ya ya ya!  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man ...
