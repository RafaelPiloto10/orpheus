Full of greed you sell your soul  
Full of pride a heavy load  
You eat yourself gluttony  
Resent yourself you envy me  
Everything turns into wrath  
You lust yourself to death  
Deep fears that drive us  
Hid beneath disguises  
Judge the world within  
Forgive my deadly sins  
Procrastination always giving up  
Something better comes to interrupt  
Cast your verdict down to me  
Spare me your bleeding sympathy  
Only care how you appear  
Clearly see you can't see clear  
Deep fears that drive us  
Hid beneath disguises  
Judge the world within  
Forgive my deadly sins  
Greed, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, death, deadly seven  
Seven deadly sins of mine  
On every street  
And corner lie  
These seven deadly sins of mine
