[Intro]  
Got a crush on a new toy  
And boy its never safe  
Making all of the bad choices  
But its a brighter day  
  
[Pre-hook]  
I know that I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love  
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love  
I know that I'm hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust  
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust  
[Hook]  
It's like you gambling, falling for me  
I'll kill you, you gon' lose  
It's like you gambling, falling for me  
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you gon' lose  
Gambling, falling for me, I'll kill you, you gon' lose it all  
  
[Verse]  
I'll send you back and forth, you'll never know you try your luck  
They call me Las Vegas, you get what you pay for  
Girl, I'm not your lucky card, I'mma make you take a loss  
But I am worth it, love's what we wage for  
  
[Pre-hook]  
I know that I'm, hard to love, hard to love, hard to love  
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love  
And I know that I'm, hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust  
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust  
  
[Hook]  
It's like you gambling, falling for me  
I'll kill you, you gon' lose  
It's like you gambling, falling for me  
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you might lose  
Gambling, falling for me, it might kill you, yeah you could lose it all  
  
[Bridge]  
I'mma make it free fall baby, fall into infinity  
I'mma make it go real crazy, shit ain't ever like it seems  
I'm your adrenaline, I'm your problem  
I'm your amphetamine, you kiss all of me  
  
[Hook]  
It's like you gambling, falling for me  
I'll kill you, you gon' lose  
Like you gambling, falling for me  
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you gon' lose  
Gambling, falling for me, it could kill you, but you could win it all
