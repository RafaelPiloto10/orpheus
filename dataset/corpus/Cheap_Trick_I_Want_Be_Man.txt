I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
I don't like living inside  
This metal plastic shell  
It's no way to treat your help  
They'll tell you go to hell  
  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
Faster master  
I've got better things which I can do  
Hey I don't like livin' in this fleshy human shell  
As much as I abuse it, it's really gone to hell  
  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
I'd rather be a robot  
So I don't have to think  
'cause then I could be programmed  
Where I don't have to dream  
I'd rather be a man  
Instead of a machine  
Flesh and blood life and death  
It's a mystery  
Nothing to be programmed  
Nothing is for sure  
And least there's a reason  
A reason for my life  
I want be man  
You want be me  
  
I want to live in your body (hey)
