They were guardians of the breath  
Trusted with those precious chances  
Keeping gaia from the fear of death  
Balances must be defended  
  
To take only what they must  
(borrowed from the future)  
Live in lovers of a global home  
(our children will remember)  
  
Guardians slept while comfort came  
The vapours poison, the acid rain fell  
The spirit cut from earthly bounds  
The creature stirred the pain  
  
How much abuse can she take  
(awake from your dreamtime)  
The lines are drawn our justice awaits  
(will the guardians surrender)  
  
The forest bare, a desert born  
The life pushed out  
They sold her cheaply  
All for a shilling for next weeks treat  
A marvel that had taken ten thousand years  
  
To take only what they must  
(borrowed from the future)  
Live in lovers of a global home  
(our children will remember)  
  
They are guardians of the breath  
Trusted with those precious chances  
They are guardians of the breath  
Balances must be defended
