We can't play this game anymore  
But can we still be friends  
Things just can't go on like before  
But can we still be friends  
  
We had something to learn  
Now it's time for the wheel to turn  
Grains of sand one by one  
Before you know it it's all gone  
  
Let's admit we made a mistake  
But can we still be friends  
Heartbreak's never easy to take  
But can we still be friends  
It's a strange sad affair  
Sometimes seems like we just don't care  
Don't waste time feeling hurt  
We've been through hell together  
  
Where do we go from here  
We can't play this game anymore  
But can we still be friends  
Things just can't go on like before  
But can we still be friends  
  
We awoke from our dream  
Things are not what they always seem  
Memories linger on  
It's like a sweet, sad, old song  
  
Where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here  
  
I can't play this game anymore  
Can we still be friends  
Things just can't go on like before  
I just want to be friends  
I just want to be, want to be, want to be  
And now I just want to be friends  
We had something to learn, something to learn  
Now can we still be friends  
Let's admit our mistakes
