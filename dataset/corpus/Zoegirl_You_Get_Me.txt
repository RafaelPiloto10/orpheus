V1 Wonderful is what i perceived  
this life would be  
pain and problem free  
but over time i found reality  
and through it all i see  
that you're the only one who gets me!  
  
Chorus I may be missunderstood cause I would and never fake it  
you're the only one who understands my pain  
cause you get me(you get me)  
doesn't matter what they do,  
what they think,  
what they say  
at the end of the day,  
I'm ok anyway  
cause Lord, you get me  
  
V2 No more tears it's a silent night  
you've broken down all fears  
cause you've invaded all of me  
you know me better that i know my self  
the key to my security  
it you're the only one who gets me!  
  
(chorus)  
  
Bridge 1 I don't care what the world may say  
i hear you call me by name  
and I reach for you  
reach for you  
there is nothing that i'd rather do  
than just worship you Lord,  
I'm gonna worship you  
worship you!!!!! (i'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay) Yeah (i'm okay, i'm
okay, i'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay) yeah (i'm okay, i'm okay) Yeah

Chorus
