I'm in Outland  
Sex tension  
She whispers things I need  
Look in her heart  
Slow motion  
'I've been expecting you.'  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  
I'm in Outland  
Storm my heart  
Tear me up if you like.  
Come closer  
Say nothing  
I've got something for you.  
I shape sound  
I shape time  
I'll shape your world for you.  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  
I'm in Outland  
Emotion  
Dark whispers in my head.  
Got the sex scream  
On new film  
I've got the friend I need.  
Don't play safe  
Don't play clean  
Don't play if you can't lose.  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.
