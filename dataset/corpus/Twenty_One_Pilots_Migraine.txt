Am I the only one I know  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
  
I-I-I I've got a migraine.  
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways.  
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays  
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days.  
  
I don't know why they always seem so dismal.  
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle.  
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed  
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.  
Let it be said what the headache represents  
It's me defending in suspense  
It's me suspended in a defenseless test  
Being tested by a ruthless examiner  
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts.  
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock.  
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead  
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.  
  
Am I the only one I know,  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
But I know, we've made it this far, kid.  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I am not as fine as I seem.  
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens  
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me  
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees.  
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait.  
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead  
And how it is a door that hold's back contents  
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent.  
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence  
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find  
I did not know it was such a violent island  
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions.  
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin  
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win.  
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find  
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind.  
  
Am I the only one I know,  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.  
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
But I know, we've made it this far, kid.  
  
And I will say that we should take a day to break away  
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone.  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it  
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone.  
  
And I will say that we should take a day to break away  
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone.  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it

Am I the only one I know,

Shadows will scream that I'm alone.  
But I know, we've made it this far, kid.  
  
Made it this far  
Made it this fa
