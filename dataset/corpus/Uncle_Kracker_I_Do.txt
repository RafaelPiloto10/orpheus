You spend your lonely days lookin' for someone  
I just want to be the one that makes your river run  
I know it ain't so fun bein all alone  
And I know you wonder when you'll find yourself a home  
You ain't foolin' no one baby  
See you don't believe in you  
But I do  
Yeah I do  
Oh I do  
Yeah I do  
  
If you want some company  
I don't mind a ride  
I don't want your money baby  
And I don't want your pride  
You might think I'm crazy  
You just might be shy  
I think this is good for us  
But I could just be high  
We can make this happen baby  
I believe that's true  
Yeah I do  
Yes I do  
Oh I do  
Yes I do  
  
You keep on lookin' baby  
I hope it's all too sweet  
I hope its fairy tales  
And everything you dream  
  
But just remember that we ain't all this kind  
When you get tired of lookin' baby I ain't hard to find  
Your wastin' all your time out there  
'cause they don't care about you  
But I do  
Yeah I do  
Oh I do  
Yeah I do  
Oh I do  
Yeah I do
