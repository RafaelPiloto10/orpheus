Never been to England, never been to France  
Never really learned how to dance  
I've never taken dope and I've never taken drugs  
Ah, I've never danced on a bear-skin rug  
Guess it's true, what all the people they say  
I'm gonna have to loose my hometown ways  
Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life  
  
Never went around with anything  
I've had a hometown life  
And I have never learned to swing  
Not much of a life, I haven't seen much  
I've been true to my wife and it's just been too much  
Guess it's true, what all these people they say  
I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways  
You know it's true, guess, I've led a sheltered life  
  
Guess it's true, what all these people they say  
I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways  
Guess it's true, guess, I've led a sheltered life
