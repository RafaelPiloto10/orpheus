I find it in an atlas  
Or flipping over old news  
Check what's in the trash bag  
Well just another part of you  
Well just another part of you  
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon  
Oh-ah!  
  
Blame me for where you are  
Tell me what I gotta lose  
That's a bit fancy  
Well just another part of you  
Well just another part of you  
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon  
Oh-ah!  
  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
  
We were overlooked  
Like a puzzle book  
Dead in the eyes  
Dead in the eyes  
Watch us from the nooks, ah  
We were overlooked  
Like a puzzle book  
Dead in the eyes  
Dead in the eyes  
Won't you find the next, ah  
  
Well just another part of you  
Well just another part of you  
Well just another part of you  
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon  
Oh-ah!  
  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it  
For three days  
We read it
