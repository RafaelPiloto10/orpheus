Long years ago on a deep winter night  
High in the heavens, a star shone bright  
While in the manger, a wee baby lay  
Sweetly asleep on a bed of hay  
  
Jesus our Lord was that baby so small  
Laid down to sleep in a humble stall  
Then came the star and it stood overhead  
Shedding its light 'round His little head  
  
Dear baby Jesus, how tiny Thou art  
I'll make a place for Thee in my heart  
And when the stars in the heavens I see  
Ever and always I think of Thee
