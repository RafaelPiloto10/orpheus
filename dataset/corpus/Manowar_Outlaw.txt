I'm A Stranger In Town And My Guns Never Cold  
I'm A Gabler So Bet On Your Life  
You'll Never Live To Grow Old  
I Deal In Lead I Won't Step Aside  
Where Trouble's Waitin Well So Am I  
I Live For The Fight The Thrill Of The Kill  
Paid In Gold For The Blood I Spill  
  
Outlaw Outlaw Outlaw Ride  
Into The West A Gun By Your Side  
Hell And Glory Honor And Pride  
A Gun Will Decide Where The Outlaws Ride  
  
The Law Of The West Was The Law Of The Gun  
Shoot And Be Fast Lives On The Run  
Stay Alive Be Fast On The Draw  
Live By The Gun Or Die By The Law  
  
Outlaw Outlaw Outlaw Ride  
Into The West A Gun By Your Side  
Hell And Glory Honor And Pride  
A Gun Will Decide Where The Outlaws Ride  
Shot Trough The Heart In The Blink Of An Eye  
Buried Up On Boot Hill  
Life Is Cheap When The Bounty Is High  
So Be Ready To Kill  
  
The Law Of The West Was The Law Of The Gun  
Shoot And Be Fast Lives On The Run  
Stay Alive Be Fast On The Draw  
Live By The Gun Or Die By The Law  
Shot Of Whisky I'll Be On My Way  
Back In The Saddle Pull On The Reins  
Spurs To The Beast Over The Hill  
Another Town One More Kill  
  
Outlaw Outlaw Outlaw Ride  
Into The West A Gun By Your Side  
Hell And Glory Honor And Pride  
A Gun Will Decide Where The Outlaws Ride
