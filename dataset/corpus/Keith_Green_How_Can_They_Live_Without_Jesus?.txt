How can they live without Jesus  
How can live without God's Love  
How can they feel so at home down here  
When there's so much more up above  
  
Throwin' away things that matter  
They hold on to things that don't  
The world has gone crazy  
But soon maybe  
A lot more are gonna know  
  
For maybe they don't understand it  
Or maybe they just haven't heard  
Or maybe we're not doin' all we can  
Living up to his Holy Word  
  
'Cause phonies have come  
And wrongs been done  
Even killing in Jesus' name  
And if you've been burned  
Here's what I've learned  
The Lord's not the one to blame  
  
For He's not just a religion  
With steeples and bells  
Or a salesman who will sell you  
The things you just want to hear  
  
For his Love was such  
That he suffered so much  
To cause some of us  
Just to follow, follow  
  
So many laughing at Jesus  
While the funniest thing that he's done  
Is love this whole stubborn rebellious world  
While their hate for him just goes on  
  
And love just like that  
Will bring him back  
For the few he can call his friends  
The ones he's found true  
Who've made it through  
Enduring until the end  
The ones he's found true  
Who've made it through  
Enduring until the end
