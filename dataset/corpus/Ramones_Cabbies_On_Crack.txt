Got into a cab, Broadway, Fifty Ninth  
Took off like a blast  
Almost lost my mind - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
  
It first felt like at thrill ride  
Excited for a while  
Got pretty scary  
Swerving at a hundred miles an hour - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
I want to get out,  
out of this yellow shell  
I want to get out,  
crack cabbies straight from hell  
  
And I don't wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
Cabbies on crack  
Want my money back  
Disco blasting out,  
Stomach in my mouth - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
  
Times Square was approaching  
He braked for the light  
At 90 miles an hour,  
flashed by, I saw my life - oh, oh, oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
I want to get out,  
out of this yellow shell  
I want to get out,  
crack cabbies straight from hell  
  
And I don't wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
And I don't wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
Cabbies on crack
