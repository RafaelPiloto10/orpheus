When we're in a crowd, I'm sure you've noticed how  
I love to look at you (you, you, you)  
No, I can't deny, I get hypnotized  
When I look at you (look at you, look at you)  
Oh, it's the kind of thing, that I can't explain  
No matter how I try  
It's no mystery, the whole world can see  
How I feel inside (feel inside)  
  
(Oh, oh baby)  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Can't help but show  
And I can't hide my heart  
  
When we're all alone, oh it's just as strong  
When I look at you  
Maybe even more, behind these doors  
As I'm loving you (loving you)  
  
(Oh, oh baby)  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Can't help but show  
And I can't hide my heart  
  
Baby you never will be lonely, as long as I'm alive  
You'll always be my one and only, for the rest of my life  
Ooooh, ooooh  
  
(Oh, oh baby)  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Can't help but show  
And I can't hide my heart  
  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
I can't hide my heart (and I can't hide my heart)  
It's been that way right from the start  
I can't hide my heart  
I can't hide my heart
