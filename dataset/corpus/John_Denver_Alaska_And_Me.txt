When I was a child and I lived in the city  
I dreamed of Alaska so far away  
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glaciers  
Somehow I knew that I'd live there one day  
  
Well it took me some growin' and a fair bit of schoolin'  
And a little bit of trouble to get on the move  
And I felt like a loser but I turned out the winner  
When I came to Alaska the land that I love  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna  
Raised in hard times but I had a good life  
From the first time I flew with my father a singin'  
I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilot's wife.  
  
We sleep near the sound of a slow running river  
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain  
And we live every day like the first or the last one  
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain.  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
Oh, for a fire on a cold winter's night  
Once more to gaze at the great northern lights  
For all of the beauty my children will see  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me  
Oh, here's to Alaska and me
