Winter's people watching  
As I sail from season's four  
To join some crazy ladies  
In a game upon the shore  
None of them with broken wings  
But still refuse to fly  
So with sweetness on my lips  
I smile a last goodbye  
And now I spend my life  
On the velvet side of hell  
Aimlessly here searching  
For what I cannot tell  
The quietness is terrible  
It's more than I can stand  
But thousands now stand cheering  
As my blood flows in the sand  
Spoken: You're not the child  
You thought you were  
You wake up in the night  
And know you're blind  
And yet they keep on pushing  
Trying the insides of your mind  
Forever, forever arresting to control  
Until the emptiness of heaven welcomes your weary soul  
Rise up with the new dawn's early morning  
Feel the sunshine warm upon your face  
Tomorrow's come a long, long way to help you  
Yes, it's your saving grace  
Every day, every way  
Tomorrow, it's your saving grace  
Well, now got no time to worry  
Cause I've got no time to hurry  
Baby, it's your saving grace  
Now don't you lay those blames on me  
Don't you play those games on me  
Cause baby it's your saving grace  
You got to need a little lovin'  
Now baby it's your saving grace  
Hey, I feel alright  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Your saving grace  
Ah, hey, hey, hey  
Your saving grace  
La la la la la la la la....  
Oh baby, it's your saving grace
