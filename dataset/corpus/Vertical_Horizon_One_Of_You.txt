Breathe in the water  
Drown in the sky  
High, high above her  
While I'm floating through your eyes  
  
Hold me in motion  
Still within your sun  
Under this ocean  
As the world melts into one  
  
And I'm hangin' on to all that I hold dear  
And I'm letting go of all of my fear  
I'm hanging on to every single one of you  
  
See all the darkness  
Blind in the light  
Deep in this forest  
Till we leave this endless night  
  
And I'm hangin' on to all that I hold dear  
And I'm letting go of all of my fear  
I'm hanging on to every single one of you  
  
Go somewhere better  
Go to the sea  
Walk through the desert  
Till your love flows over me  
  
And I'm hangin' on to all that I hold dear  
And I'm letting go of all of my fear  
I'm hanging on to every single one of you  
To every single one of you  
To every single one  
Every single one of you
