Yeah, ay yo  
2000 it's us  
Yo, it's time to u-turn  
Ya heard me?  
You're either with us, or against us, yo  
  
It's been some years now  
Since we hit the floor to get down  
We always had a step to go with the sound  
Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball  
Remember, the snake  
And how the floor used to clear  
And everybody would break  
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it  
We're bringing it all back  
This is how we do it, just  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Put your hands up, bend your knees  
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me  
Oh come on, come on  
It's not hard to learn  
Come on, come on  
It's called the u-turn  
  
In the 80s, fresh was the talk  
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk  
In the 90s, I had a high flat top  
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok  
I can't forget about my high school days  
The sound was Bobby Brown  
The dance was the running man  
Now everybody want to push Bentley's  
The year is two, everybody do the u-turn  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
All you need to do is let go  
Let the tempo take over you  
I came to have a good time  
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul  
Let it lead you to the floor, whoa  
  
[Chorus]
