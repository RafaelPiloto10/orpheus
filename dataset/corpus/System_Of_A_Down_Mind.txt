Look at each other, look at each other, look at each other, look at each
other.  
  
Go away, go away, go away, go away  
  
Mutually, mentally molested children of a mother,  
Mutually, mentally molested children of sin,  
The ever so popular beating that took you under,  
The ever so popular beating that broke your skin.  
  
Free thinkers are dangerous,  
Blame, hate, for fate's seed.  
  
Go away, go away, go away, go away  
  
Need the ones you love and love the ones you need,  
Need the one you love and love the ones you bleed,  
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you breath  
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see.  
  
Free thinkers are dangerous,  
Blame, hate, for fate's, seed.  
  
Why, why, why, why,  
Gonna let you mother fuckers die, gonna let you mother fuckers die,  
Gonna let you mother fuckers die, why  
  
Look at each other, look at each other..
