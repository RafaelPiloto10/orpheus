Sunny boy  
Now let me tell you how much good  
You've done me, boy  
'Cause when I'm feelin' low  
You give me plenty joy  
Into each lives some rain must fall  
But with you here, there's no rain at all  
  
Sunny boy  
He looks good in everything from silk to corduroy  
(Or [Incomprehensible])  
To see him, I'd walk from Idaho to Illinois  
(Or anywhere)  
Do anything to be with him  
My sunshine when the world is dim  
  
It's sunny boy, sunny boy  
My pride and joy, sunny boy  
  
Sunny boy  
You made my life so sweet  
It's just like honey, boy  
And I love you so much till it ain't funny, boy  
My cloudy days have been declouded  
Since you're here, so keep on shinin'  
  
Sunny boy, sunny boy  
My pride and joy, hey, sunny boy  
My honey boy  
Now only your sweet lovin' can give me joy  
I'm tryin' to tell the world  
That you're my sunny boy
