Baby , oh no , I've been stuck here  
I've been searchin' so long  
Baby don't go , millions of people were wrong  
In the dark of the cold light of day ,  
I will still be here  
If my heart and my soul had their way ,  
you would still be here  
  
Another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
'Cause my baby's no longer around  
And my feeling can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world  
  
Baby , you said , a guy like me was way out of line  
And knowing today , your leavin' was a question of time  
In the mist of a sweet summer rain ,you will find me here  
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way ,  
I'll be holdin' near  
Another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
'Cause my baby's no longer around  
And my feelings can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world  
  
(break)  
In the dark of the cold light of day ,  
you will find me here  
If my heart and my soul had their way ,  
you would still be here  
  
Another lonely night in New York  
And I'm just a soul in the heart of the city  
Just another lonely night in New York  
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down  
Just another lonely night in New York ( fade )
