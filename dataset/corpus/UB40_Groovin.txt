I get my kicks from watching people  
Running too and fro  
And if you ask them where they're going  
Half of the don't know  
They're the ones who think I'm crazy  
But they don't realize  
  
[Chorus]  
That I'm just groovin', groovin'  
Grooving out on life  
I'm just groovin' ooh grovin'  
Grovin' till I die  
  
I see a river flowing by me  
Heading for the sea  
I get a feeling deep inside me  
It's so good to be free  
I've got sunshine in the daytime  
And moonlight every night  
And I'm just groovin'  
  
(Middle eight)  
  
I see a river flowing by me  
Heading for the sea  
I get a feeling deep inside me  
It's so good to be free  
I've got sunshine in the daytime  
And moonlight every night  
And I'm just groovin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That I'm just groovin', groovin'  
Grooving out on life  
I'm just groovin' ooh grovin'  
Groovin' till I die
