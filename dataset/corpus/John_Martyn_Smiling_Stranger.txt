May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
You're just like a great and strong brother of mine  
And you know that I love you true  
You never talk dirty behind my back  
And I know that there's those that do  
  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind  
Love is a lesson to learn in our time  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me  
  
May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
You're just like a good and close sister to me  
And you know that I love you true  
You hold no blade to stab me in my back  
And I know that there's those that do  
  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind  
Love is a lesson to learn in our time  
Please won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me  
  
May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
Well you're just like a great and strong brother of mine  
And you know that I love you like I should  
You never talk about me behind my back  
And I know that there's time you could  
  
Please won't you please, please bear it in mind  
Life is a lesson to learn in our time  
Won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me  
  
May you never lose your temper  
If you get hit in a bar room fight  
May you never lose your woman over night  
  
May you never lay your head down  
Without a hand to hold  
May you never make your bed out in the cold  
  
Please won't you please, please won't you bear it in mind  
Life is a lesson to learn in our time  
Won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me
