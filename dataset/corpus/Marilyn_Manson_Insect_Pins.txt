I'm squirming slow now  
Sticking in it  
Swallow in your warm spit  
Repel, rip  
  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
See what's in my blood  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
See what's in my blood  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
See what's in my blood  
What'ca ya gonna feel?  
Never gonna heal  
  
Stuck and displaced  
It will drown again  
Stuck and disappeared  
Now you gonna see, now you gonna see  
Now you gonna see what's in my blood  
  
Sticking in it  
Sticking in it  
Sticking in it  
Sticking in it
