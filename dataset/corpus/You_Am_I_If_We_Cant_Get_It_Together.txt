To get up the bond for an inner west flat  
He'd work for anybody if he wasn't working for her dad.  
She' practicing saying I do or I will  
'Cause she don't know how to tell him that she's going off the pill.  
  
Her curtains are for certain that he'll talk about her ass  
But she clings to his photo like a piece of broken glass.  
We can't get it together today.  
She's looking for his heart while he stares the other way.  
  
He's dad is a nut, he's ex-girl is a slut.  
But he'll be yours forever if you just get it together.  
If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me?  
  
So they met on Tuesday at the town hall steps  
To get an eight by ten photo and a wedding date set.  
We might as well do it next week  
'Cause we've met everybody that we're ever gonna meet.  
  
He's dad is a nut, he's ex-girl is a slut  
But he'll be yours forever if you just get it together.  
If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me?  
  
Four seventy to Circular Quay.  
A present in your pocket for the TAB  
  
If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me?  
  
Would you settle for a mobile home  
A good record store and a public phone  
  
If we can't get it together, if we can't get it together.
