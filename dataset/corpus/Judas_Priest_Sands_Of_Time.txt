The winds of change are everywhere  
And all the world must be aware  
There's nowhere left for man to go  
The sands of time are running low  
  
These visions fall before my face  
I see the end of humans race  
These feelings rise inside my soul  
And everything's out of control  
  
The winds of change (Repeat 2X)  
Are in the air (Repeat 2X)  
The winds of change (Repeat 2X)  
Are everywhere
