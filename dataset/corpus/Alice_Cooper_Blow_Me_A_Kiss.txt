Take one in the leg [Think about your baby]  
Take one in the side [Think about your girl]  
Take one in the head [Think about your mother]  
Take one in the heart [It's the end of the world]  
  
So blow me a kiss 'cause I'm black  
Blow me a kiss 'cause I'm gay  
Blow me a kiss 'cause I'm shakin'  
Say goodnight then blow me away  
Blow me away  
Blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away  
  
Take one in the face [Think about your life]  
Take one in the eye [Think about your soul]  
Take one in the mouth [Think about your savior]  
Take one in the thigh [Are you ready to go]  
  
So blow me a kiss 'cause I'm lonely  
Blow me a kiss 'cause I'm afraid  
Blow me a kiss 'cause you don't know me  
Say goodnight then blow me away  
Blow me away  
Blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me away  
  
I'm in my room I'm Dr. Doom  
'Cause I'm not me I'm someone else  
Why should you die don't ask me why  
You know it, you know it, you know it  
Blow me away  
  
I turn the page I am the rage  
I'm coming from a darker place  
A much darker place  
So blow me away  
Blow me away  
Yeah blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away  
Yeah blow me away  
C'mon and blow me away  
Tell me what you're thinkin' tell me why  
Blow me a kiss then blow me away
