If ever you're feelin' lonely  
I know that I am not the only one  
That you can call  
But keep me in mind  
  
This feeling of lust is haunting  
Following me and wanting you  
To think of a time  
And keep me in mind  
  
I know you've had many  
And I haven't any to show  
But what I can't give you  
I'll equal with love  
  
When darkness resolves to slumber  
Remember that I'm your number one  
That you can call  
So keep me in mind  
  
I know that while needing someone  
Is only a thought that comes from me  
Hoping that you  
Will keep me in mind  
  
I know you've had many  
And I haven't any to show  
But what I can't give you  
I'll equal with love
