People turn around, people let you down  
Anywhere you go, anywhen you see  
It's real  
It's up to you to make it happen  
It's up to you to make it real  
  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
  
Tell me what you know  
Tell me how you feel  
It doesn't matter when you're down  
When you look at me with your eyes  
That smile on your face it seems happy  
Are you happy?  
  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
  
Yeah Yeah  
  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some
