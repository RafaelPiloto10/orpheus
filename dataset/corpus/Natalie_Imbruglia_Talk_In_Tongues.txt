When you beat on that drum  
  
Talk in that tongue  
  
You're just scratching  
  
On the surface  
  
So tell me what it means  
  
A whisper to a scream  
  
Slowly fades away  
  
Then you wake up  
  
And tomorrow is today  
  
And you're crying  
  
Crying like a baby  
  
Caught between the tides  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
  
  
Do you know where I've been  
  
Walls are caving in  
  
It moves across a wire  
  
There no need to talk  
  
I crawl as you walk  
  
Pushing me away  
  
Then you wake up  
  
And tomorrow is today  
  
And you're crying  
  
Crying like a baby  
  
Caught between the tides  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
  
  
Flowers in the bin  
  
Close this hole I'm in  
  
Everything was one  
  
Nothing gets undone  
  
You pay the bill  
  
You lost your will  
  
Just run away until  
  
you wake up  
  
And tomorrow is today  
  
And you're crying  
  
Crying like a baby  
  
Caught between the tides  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way
