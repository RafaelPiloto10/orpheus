[Intro:]  
I'm very excited to be here  
Yet again, it's an honor to be nominated  
Bla bla bla bla  
  
Well that Brits night was so fucking boring  
Past the days of yes, yes, Charlene  
Coke in the box til 7 in the morning  
Look the wrong way and we end up brawling  
When I had a bit of beef with you know who  
And I fucked a few female stars or two  
Nearly everything I said I'd end getting screwed  
Spitting at the... looking rude in the news  
Oh yes, you're still rocking with the best!  
Second person on my year to have touched a breast  
I'm nearly 40 now and I'm still impressed  
Here's the midlife crisis I guess.  
Oh I recall, taking in the wonder of it all  
  
Chorus:  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!  
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!  
I still want to get laid by you right!  
  
Now I know I've got fat but make no mistake  
Every million that I make they bake me a cake  
So I've got plenty, 120  
Wearing rows of tweed like the...  
I still want to get you naked  
I'll see you in the summer, so glad you could make it!  
I'll be that mega white thing, fast as lightening  
In... shape, but twice as frightening.  
If they can't be bothered, then I promise you this  
If they won't entertain you then I'll do my fucking best!  
  
Chorus:  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!  
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!  
I still want to get laid by you!  
  
Would you let me lay you down right here?  
Would you let me live?  
  
Chorus:  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!  
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!  
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!
