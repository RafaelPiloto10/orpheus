You told me it was so, a million dreams ago,  
You held me in your arms, a million dreams ago.  
So many dreams have flown, so many nights alone  
I guess I should have known, it couldn't be.  
I'll lock my memories here in my heart  
  
And here in my heart they'll stay.  
And through the years, they'll always be part  
A part of a lovely day  
Goodbye, good luck old friend, I'll smile and just pretend  
There was no end, a million dreams ago.  
  
Goodbye, good luck old friend, I'll smile and just pretend  
There was no end, a million dreams ago.
