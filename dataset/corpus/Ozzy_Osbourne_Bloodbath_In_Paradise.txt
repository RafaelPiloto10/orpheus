Your comin' home - there's blood on the walls and charlie  
And the family made house calls. If you're alone then watch  
What you do 'cos charlie and the family might get you.  
  
Can you hear them in the darkness, helter skelter, spiral  
Madness, yeah, bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where  
You can run to baby, bloodbath in paradise, forever sleep in  
Paradise.  
  
California sun - but you're still in bed and the California rain  
Is turning red. No sign of life or the keepers of doom in  
Charlie and the keeper's scarlet room.  
  
Can you hear them in the darkness, helter skelter, spiral  
Madness, yah, bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where  
You can run to baby, bloodbath in paradise - forever sleep in  
Paradise.  
  
They'll summon you, to wake from the dead as you lie  
Bleeding, murdered in your bed. The sweetest dreams are all  
In your mind but no one wakes when charlie creeps behind,  
Yeah.  
  
Execution halts your breath, helter skelter spiral death,  
Bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where you break out baby,  
Bloodbath in paradise, forever sleep in paradise.
