Sugar Sugar Sugar  
That man is bad  
The road he drives you down  
O sugar it's a drag  
  
That road it twists  
That road is crossed  
Its down that road  
A lot of little girls go lost  
  
Sugar Sugar Sugar  
Keep on driving on  
Until the City of right  
Becomes the City of wrong  
  
That stretch is long  
You'll sleep and slide  
That stretch will find you  
Gagged and tied  
  
The hunter lies  
In a lowly ditch  
His eyes they sting  
And his fingers twitch  
  
You'll be his queen for the night  
But the morning you'll wake  
With the Lords and high ladies  
Of the bottom of the lake  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
That man is wild  
And sugar, you know  
That you're merely a child  
  
He will laugh  
And hang your sheets to see  
The tokens of your virginity  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
Honey you're so sweet  
And beside you baby  
Nothing can complete  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
Honey your so sweet  
But beside you baby  
A bad man sleeps  
  
You better pray baby  
Pray baby, pray baby  
You better pray  
You better pray, baby  
Pray, baby, pray baby  
You better pray baby  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
That man is bad  
And that's the bottom baby  
Coming right up ahead  
  
You can smell his fear  
You can smell his love  
As he wipes his mouth  
On your altar cloth  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
Try to understand  
I'm an angel of God  
I'm your guardian  
  
He smells you innocence  
And like a dog he comes  
And like all the dogs he is  
I shut him down  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
I can't explain  
Must I kill that cocksucker  
Everyday  
  
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby  
You better pray your daddy he ain't far away  
You better pray baby pray baby pray baby  
You better pray your daddy's come to take you away  
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby  
You better pray o tender prey baby tender prey  
You better pray tender pray baby tender prey
