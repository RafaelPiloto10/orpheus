All deserters will be shot  
at 5 o'clock tomorrow morning  
so get yourselves together  
and quit messing around  
No more nonsense!  
The assassination occurred at 3.30  
No one was there to witness it  
Even the breviaries had left their tapestries on the window  
And we were all silenced  
by the sad mildew cloud  
that followed around  
I wish I was back in the land of the...  
of the...  
Aaahm uhm...  
You can't pin that one on me  
I didn't do a goddamn thing  
I was just standing there  
Then a bunch of guys came up  
and started laying all this shit on me  
Now what am I supposed to do?  
I'm an American! You can't touch me!  
Did you know all nuns are 42?  
And their eyes are blue?  
Did you know all table clothes  
are white in France?  
Did you know women wear underpants?  
Well, they do!  
How does a musician imitate  
the sound of underpants sliding  
over a woman's thighs,  
down over her ankles,  
and over her little toes?  
And the rings on her toes?  
And her unquipped toe nails?  
Lightning struck the magic purse  
I didn't do a damn thing, man!  
I was just standing there  
in front of the 'Delicatessen'  
and all these rabbies ran up  
and a bunch of Indians and freaks  
and monsters and f.... just started ...  
mhmh... talking in all these weird languages...  
What aah ... what ... could I say?  
Hey, I'm tired of being a freaky musician  
I wanna be Napoleon!  
Let's have some more wars around here!  
What a stinking, shitty little war we have running over there  
Let's get a big one!  
A real big one!  
With a lotta killings and bombs and blood!  
Schooldays...  
Schooldays...  
Good old-fashioned rule days...  
Schooldays...  
Schooldays...  
Good old-fashioned rule days.
