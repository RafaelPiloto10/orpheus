[Chorus:]  
I could be singing forever  
I guess you could say I'm in love  
The universe is getting together  
You know that I can't say it enough  
You and your friends have a party  
Welcome your heavenly dad  
  
Remember the guy by the water  
We seen walkin' 'round on the air  
He went and learned for a quarter  
He knew that you could see him there  
You take your friends to the ocean  
Walk on the sand if you can  
  
Spiro stepped out on the door step  
He spoke like he had something to say  
He said, "I don't want to hear anybody."  
I guess he's going to be that way  
  
Even all the elephants hear you, Spiro  
Would you believe it at last?  
Nobody wants to be near you  
The new world is coming that fast  
  
They're beating on you in Chicago  
They're picking you up on the coast  
They're knocking you off in Ohio  
They like sending you to war the most  
  
When will you get it together?  
Everybody in this land  
Helping out your brothers and sisters  
Everyone must understand  
  
[Chorus]
