A decade ago  
I never thought I would be  
At twenty-three  
On the verge of spontaneous combustion  
Wo-is-me  
  
But I guess that it comes with the territory  
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity  
I need you to hear  
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take  
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me  
  
So pardon me while I burst into flames  
Pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same  
  
Not two days ago  
I was having a look in a book  
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee  
I said, 'I can relate?'  
Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication  
As a welcomed vacation  
From the burdens of the planet earth  
  
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D  
And thinking so much differently  
  
So pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same  
  
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D  
And thinking so much differently
