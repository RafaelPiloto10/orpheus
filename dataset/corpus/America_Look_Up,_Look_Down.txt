Found on Heard.  
  
Look up, look down  
Gotta find me a hole to hide my head in the ground  
Look up, look down  
Gettin' tired of my woman runnin' around  
  
Everybody says give her a second chance  
But that'll be the seventy-second time in advance  
Look up, look down  
Gotta get to the ground  
  
Look up, look down  
Watch the whole wide world spinnin' around  
Look up, look down  
Baby find my woman runnin' around  
  
Everybody says give her a second chance  
But that'll be the seventy-second time in advance  
Look up, look down  
Gotta get to the ground  
  
Ra da da da da ....  
  
Look up, look down  
Gotta find me a hole to hide my head in the ground  
Look up, look down  
Gettin' tired of my woman runnin' around  
  
Gettin' tired of my woman runnin' around  
Gettin' tired of my woman runnin' around  
Gettin' so tired of my woman runnin' around
