It gets harder every day, but I can't seem to shake the pain  
I'm trying to find the words to say, please say  
It's written all over my face, I can't  
Function the same when you're not here  
I'm calling your name and no one's there  
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy,  
I still can't believe you found somebody new  
But I wish you the best, I guess.  
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows  
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt  
We've heard it all before, that everybody knows  
How to make it right, I wish we gave it one more try  
One more try  
One more try  
'Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows  
  
I don't care what the people say  
They brought it all in anyway  
Baby don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said  
It seems like you just don't know  
The radio's on, you tuning me out,  
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down  
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy,  
I still can't believe you found somebody new  
But I wish you the best, I guess.  
'Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows  
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt  
We've heard it all before, that everybody knows  
How to make it right, I wish we gave it one more try  
One more try  
One more try  
One more try  
'Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows  
  
Oh I wish you'd understand  
Oh, just an ordinary man  
Wish that we'd have known  
Everybody knows, but nobody really knows  
And I know one day you'll see, nobody has it easy  
I still can't believe you found somebody new  
I wish you the best, I guess.  
  
'Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows  
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt  
We've heard it all before, that everybody knows  
How to make it right, I wish we gave it one more try  
One more try  
One more try  
One more try  
'Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows
