The Holy Spirit is here and His power is real  
Anything can happen and it probably will  
Something very good something good is going on around here  
  
There's a light that shines to make the dark disappear  
A power at work but there's nothing to fear  
Something very good something good is going on around here  
  
This is a church on fire  
This is the Holy Spirit flame  
We have a burning desire  
To lift up Jesus' name  
Let the fire burn in every heart  
To light the way, defeat the dark  
Let the flame of love burn higher  
This is a church  
This is a church on fire
