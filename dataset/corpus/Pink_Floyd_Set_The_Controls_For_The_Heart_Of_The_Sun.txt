Little by little the night turns around.  
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn.  
Lotus's lean on each other in union.  
Over the hills where a swallow is resting.  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  
  
Over the mountain watching the watcher.  
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine.  
Morning to birth is born into shadow  
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine.  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.  
  
Who is the man who arrives at the wall?  
Making the shape of his questions at asking.  
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening.  
Will he remember the lesson of giving?  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.
