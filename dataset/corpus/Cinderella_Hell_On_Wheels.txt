We hang tough  
When the chips are low  
Can't buy enough  
So we steal the show  
We get so hot  
We can't cool down  
So the hell with that  
We're rippin' through your town  
  
We've had enough of the raw deals  
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels  
  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
  
We live fast  
But we love it so  
Can't see the past  
But it's gone we know  
We get so hot  
We can't cool down  
So the hell with that  
We're burnin' through your town  
  
We've had enough of the raw deals  
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels  
  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Run like hell  
  
Hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels
