(Rule Number Two  
Understanding what you have is bigger than this)  
  
Feeling alone in the middle of the sea  
That's what it feels like  
Two weeks later and you're still not talking to me  
  
Baby, the energy it takes  
To act like I'm not there  
We could be using that to make up  
But you don't even seem to care  
  
So let me try this again  
  
I'm sorry for the wrong that I did  
Why can't we just get over it?  
  
Say it right  
We're bigger than this  
Bigger than this stupid fight  
Baby girl, we're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
  
Staying mad at me, for eternity  
What's that gonna be?  
So baby girl, try  
What we got is so much bigger than this  
Bigger Than This
