Papa said don't go to discos  
Mama said don't play with boys  
Sister said stop all romancing  
Brother said stop all your noise  
  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
  
Papa said ain't working harder  
Better stay and work through the night  
Come over here and sit in my lap now  
You might get a rise if you do what is right  
  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
  
Got to tear off your chains  
Pull up your roots  
Pack up your money  
And put on back your boots and breakaway  
  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
  
Stand up boy, down at the disco  
Say I like you, will you dance on with me  
Say I love you, you're the girl I've been wanting  
Maybe some day you can marry me  
  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
Breakaway ha, ha breakaway  
  
Got to tear off your chains...
