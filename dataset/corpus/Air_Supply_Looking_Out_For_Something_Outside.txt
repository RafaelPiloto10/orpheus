Won't you think about it  
Do you know that it's easier said when it's done  
We're all in this together  
I'm not asking too much  
Just some time to stay for as long  
As you can  
It's already tomorrow  
  
Looking out for something outside  
I'm sure you can give me the answer  
Won't you say you'll give me some time  
That's all I can ask for an answer  
  
Everybody's leavin' won't you try  
To let me show you how  
Put some weight on your shoulders  
Everybody knew your eyes were searching  
Around the room  
Till I saw you  
  
Looking out for something outside  
I'm sure you can give me the answer  
Won't you say you'll give me some time  
That's all I can ask for an answer  
  
What am I to do  
What am I to do  
When she turns me down  
Just give up on you  
Can't stop all I need to the ground
