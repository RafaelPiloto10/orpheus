All the sorrow and the pain  
All the sacrifice in vain  
I was much too blind to see  
You make a loser out of me  
You put me down for oh so long  
While you sang your serpent's song  
  
[Chorus]  
The rest is history  
You can do no more to me  
I've been down so low  
Had nowhere left to go  
I could see it in your eyes  
All your promises were lies  
Promises and lies  
  
Your cut was quick and deep  
But then you thought you'd never need a friend  
But all things change, and tides must turn  
And you let all your bridges burn  
Too many fatal wounds to heal  
  
[Chorus]
