I don't go looking for trouble,  
It's always coming my way,  
But, I've been looking for you,  
And like the summer sun, you welcome my day.  
  
So come on, come on,  
And give your man some rock 'n' roll,  
And get yourself some sweet rock 'n' roll.  
  
I'm just a soldier of fortune,  
Must be the gypsy in me.  
I ain't along when I say  
I never needed love so badly before.  
  
Hear me singing "Come on, come on"!  
Give your man some rock 'n' roll,  
And get yourself some sweet rock 'n' roll.  
  
I keep singing, "Come on, come on"!  
"Come on, come on"!  
Give your man some rock 'n' roll,  
Give your man some rock 'n' roll,  
Come on and get some sweet rock,  
Come on and get some sweet rock,  
Come on and get some sweet rock 'n' roll.  
Must be the gypsy in me,  
Can see the angel in you.
