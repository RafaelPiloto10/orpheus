Five foot two, eyes of blue  
But, oh, what those five foot could do  
Has anyone seen my gal?  
  
Turned up nose and turned down hose  
Never had another beau  
Has anyone seen my gal?  
  
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur  
Diamond ring and all those things  
Bet your life it isn't hers  
Could she love? Could she woo?  
Could she love? Could she coo?  
Has anyone seen my gal?
