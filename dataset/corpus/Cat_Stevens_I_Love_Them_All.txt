While lookin' into my drawer only yesterday  
You know, the things that I saw made me cry  
I saw the pictures and letters,  
I should have known better  
Than to try to deny  
  
I love them all  
I love them all  
And if they came again  
I'd do the same again  
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy  
  
And as I walked through the park where we used to play  
You know, the bench and the tree are still there  
And the pictures that you did,  
Why am I so stupid?  
They won't ever disappear  
  
I love them all  
I love them all  
And if they came again  
I'd do the same again  
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy
