I never really understood religion  
Except it seems a good excuse to kill  
I never really could make a decision  
I don't surpose I ever really will  
  
I can't relate to any power structure  
Where ego is the driving energy  
I let mine go long, long time ago, now  
When I decided that I would be free  
  
Only thing I understand is living  
The biggest sacrifice to make is death  
Once you're dead, there's noting left for giving  
The life means fighting your every breath
