Here, certified unsound I feel like you  
There's someone I've found, so far he's true  
Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show the others who know  
And I am tied to your strings and twisted  
So medication still the devil in me  
So into make believe, your smile I see  
Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
Hold me in this tiny room sedated here I'll stay  
Next to me, I beg of you don't throw the key away  
Out of me there's a voice which keeps calling  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm hiding alone, crazy I know, and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm just waiting to show all the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
I'm going crazy, boy, look out  
(Tied to your strings and twisted) Look out, boy
