We are the stars up in the sky  
We light the darkness you and I  
We are the flicker in the night  
Never shine so bright  
  
We are the strong and though we fall  
We fought for love we risked it all  
Never back down against the walls  
It's what we're living for yeah  
  
Keep on rising higher  
Blazing through the fire  
Right down to the wire  
Rise the fire higher  
As we stand together  
Chase our dreams forever  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Although the road ahead was long  
I was too weak to carry on  
You picked me up you were my home  
I never stood alone  
  
No one can tell us what we want  
No one can stop us anymore  
No looking back we're moving forward  
No one can take this moment away  
  
Keep on rising higher  
Blazing through the fire  
Right down to the wire  
Rise the fire higher  
As we stand together  
Chase our dreams forever  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
When skies are grey  
I'll light your way  
I'll be your shoulder  
You can lean on me  
  
When skies are grey  
I'll light your way  
I'll be your shoulder  
You can lean on me  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
We light up the sky  
Light up the sky  
We light up the sky  
We light up the sky
