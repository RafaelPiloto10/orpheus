I'm not as crazy as I used to be  
Some of my devils upped and left me free  
To find a quiet space  
I'm not as out of place  
  
I'm not as lonely as I was before  
I don't go in 'less there's an open door to leave by  
I'm starting to believe my own existence has a right to be  
  
And I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay  
  
The poets cried for dreams they never saw  
The only certainty is nothin's sure  
And most things stay the same  
Or go back where they came  
  
And though my answers still are undefined  
By takin' chances I can start to find some reasons  
Somethin' to believe in  
I can make it through  
I can make it through  
  
And I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay  
  
Oh, and I'm comin' home again  
It's been too long a time  
Gettin' back what's mine  
And I can't remember why I went away  
But it's lookin' now like maybe I can stay
