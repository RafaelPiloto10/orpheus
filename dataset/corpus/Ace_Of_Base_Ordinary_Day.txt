Ah  
ah ha ha ah  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
But you're sleeping on my arm  
I'm longing to wake you up  
  
I want it simple  
I have travelled around the world  
I can never see myself in the rain  
Walking out  
Now it's you and me  
And we take it from here and now  
Twosome wild and free  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow  
  
Would I lie, would I lie  
To something so obvious to myself  
I'm wanting you day and night  
I see your smile  
Whe you're waking up here beside me  
And your hair is a mess  
And I can't resist you  
It's heaven on earth  
How will I do  
To protect our little world  
Easy life bye bye  
  
It's heaven on earth  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
It's an ordinary day (Come, come, come to me)  
  
Come, come, come to me (ordinary day)  
Come, come, come to me  
Come, come, come to me  
  
Oh when you come to me  
I can never see myself in the rain  
Walking out (oh, when you come to me)  
Twosome wild and free  
  
I want to kiss you  
Just not ordinary miss you  
It's an ordinary day  
I would like to do the same tomorrow
