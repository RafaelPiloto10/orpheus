A hundred year old photograph stares out from a frame  
And if you look real close, you'll see our eyes are just the same  
I never met them face to face but I still know them well  
From the stories my dear grandma would tell  
  
Elijah was a farmer, he knew how to make things grow  
And Fannie vowed she'd follow him wherever he would go  
As things turned out, they never left their small Kentucky farm  
But he kept her fed, she kept him warm  
  
They're my guardian angels and I know they can see  
Every step I take, they are watching over me  
I might not know where I'm goin' but I'm sure where I come from  
They're my guardian angels and I'm their special one  
  
Sometimes when I'm tired, I feel Elijah take my arm  
He says, "Keep a goin', hard work never did a body harm"  
And when I'm really troubled and I don't know what to do  
Fannie whispers, "Just do your best, we're awful proud of you"  
  
They're my guardian angels and I know they can see  
Every step I take, they are watching over me  
I might not know where I'm goin' but I'm sure where I come from  
They're my guardian angels and I'm their special one
