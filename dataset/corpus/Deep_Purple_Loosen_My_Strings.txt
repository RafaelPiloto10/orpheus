Wake up in the morning  
Get into bed  
Closing my eyes  
I rest my head  
  
There is no arrangement  
No time no place  
It's gone in the wind  
And left no trace  
  
Who can say,  
maybe or whatever.  
It's up to you  
You know you can trust me  
I'll make it up to you  
  
You move with the action  
You loosen my strings  
Your fingers can smooth out my jangles  
And all those things  
  
Grease on the handle  
and the tangles in my hair  
They always seem to go together  
I don't care
