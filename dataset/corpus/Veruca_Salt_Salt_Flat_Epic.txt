Salt lakes I saved for myself  
I never thought you'd leave  
Countries I've claimed to myself  
I know you'll never be yourself again  
But what you were is still in question  
Pacific ocean's way too small  
For both of us to swim  
Antarctica will have to thaw  
For us to meet again  
And I respect the all of what is fair and worthy  
And I will never feel this way about another person  
And I will never feel this way again  
I want to make you understand  
It's not the songs and it's not the band  
I'm still afraid but I'm doing the best I can  
Given grace and all the saints  
You'll never be near me  
You got your drummer  
You got your faith  
I've re-defined the laws of friends  
And what won't happen ever again  
And I will never feel this way about another person  
And I will never feel this way again  
I want to make you understand  
It's not the drugs and it's definitely not a man  
I'm still afraid but I'm doing the best I can  
Doing the best I can  
I'm doing the best I can  
That's enough for now.  
That's enough for now.  
That's enough for now.  
That's enough for now.  
Now I practice the art of forgetting...
