Even though you're near me  
I need you far away  
To be a notion  
To build another way  
  
I'll be broken and I know it  
But I just can't seem to find another way  
  
Though you want to  
Though you try to  
You can't stop the rain  
For the first time  
It's not you  
Who can heal me  
  
I need some distance to find another road  
Its not so easy, sorrow was such a heavy load  
  
I'll be broken and I know it  
But I just can't seem to find another way  
  
Though you want to  
Though you try to  
You can't stop the rain  
For the first time  
It's not you  
Who can heal me  
  
Poets say  
As time decays  
And broken souls will mend  
But you would come around again  
So my sorrow's gonna end  
  
But it's not you  
Heal me  
But it's not you  
Heal me  
  
Though you want to (though you want to)  
Though you try to (thought you try to)  
You can't stop the rain  
For the first time  
It's not you  
Who can heal me  
  
Though you want to (though you want to)  
Though you try to (thought you try to)  
You can't stop the rain  
For the first time  
It's not you  
Who can heal me  
Heal me
