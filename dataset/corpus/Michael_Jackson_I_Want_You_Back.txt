When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
  
Then someone picked you from the bunch  
One glance was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh, baby, give me one more chance  
To show you that I love you  
Won't you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go  
Let you go baby  
Cause now since I see you it is all  
I want you back  
Yes, I do now  
I want you back  
Oo oo baby  
I want you back  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I want you back  
Now now now now  
  
Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
  
Every street you walk on  
I leave tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't even want around.  
(Let me show you now)  
  
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance  
To show you that I love you  
Won't you please let me  
Back in your heart  
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go  
Let you go baby  
Cause now since I see you it is all  
  
Ah bah bah bah buh  
All I want  
Ah bah bah bah buh  
All I need  
Ah bah bah bah buh  
All I want  
Ah bah bah bah buh  
All I need  
  
Oh, just one more chance  
To show that I love you, baby!  
  
Baby!  
Baby!  
Baby!  
  
I want you back  
Forget what happened then  
  
Oh, baby I was blind to let you go  
Cause now since I see you it is all  
I want you back  
Oh, baby I need one more chance
