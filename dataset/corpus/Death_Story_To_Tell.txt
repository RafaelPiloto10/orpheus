Drifting into the lives  
Seep into the soul where emotions hide  
Dark skies were beating me down  
With shadows of deceit slashing at  
Trust till it forever bleeds  
With doubt, with pain, with trust  
Is pain.  
  
When you think of me in your  
Multidimesional mind, try and wash the  
"Evil" from your mind and open it.  
  
When you taste the truth you will  
See like others before me, to you  
I am past, a story to tell  
Tell it.  
  
You may think you own the end  
Take another close look at the script  
  
Of sadness etched in the book.
