Fields of sun-blossomed flowers  
Ever so gently movin' about  
Fields of life-givin' sun  
Plant the Earth  
And bring the new young in sprout  
This is the never-ending story  
Of life which goes on  
Day in and day out  
Mountains of evergreen trees  
Standing tall and straight  
Like soldiers about
