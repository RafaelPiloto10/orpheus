It used to seem to me  
That my life ran on too fast  
And I had to take it slowly  
Just to make the good parts last  
But when you're born to run  
It's so hard to just slow down  
So don't be surprised to see me  
Back in that bright part of town  
  
I'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
I'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in  
And I'll drink and dance with one hand free  
Let the world back into me  
And on I'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again  
  
You used to be the best  
To make life be life to me  
And I hope that you're still out there  
And you're like you used to be  
We'll have ourselves a time  
And we'll dance 'til the morning sun  
And we'll let the good times come in  
And we won't stop 'til we're done  
  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily  
And oh we'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again  
  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily  
And oh we'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again
