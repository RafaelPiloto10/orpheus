Be on you way  
Don't try to say that  
You love me still.  
If we couldn't find  
The right dream by now  
Then we never will.  
We paid our dues at the door  
And never once saw the stage.  
We wrote our share of love's lore  
And never quite filled the page.  
So be on your way.  
  
Be on your way.  
Maybe someday we will  
Meet again.  
Try not to cry  
Tears make me think  
How it might have been.  
We loved as strong as we could  
But love only got in our way.  
We took our time to be free  
There's nothing much more to say but  
Be on your way.
