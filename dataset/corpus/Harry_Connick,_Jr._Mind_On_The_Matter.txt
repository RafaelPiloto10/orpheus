Mama told me not to try to be nobody  
I listened to her  
Mama told me I'd grow up to be somebody  
Looka here  
  
Savin' money's hard when you can't save your soul  
I'll get through it  
Tryin' to dig myself out of this mighty hole  
Listen to what I say  
  
Got my mind on the matter  
Sure as I tell ya  
Now you know that's right  
I look down at my hands and  
I see labor burns  
It's a part of livin'  
Keepin' my feet on the ground while the world turns  
  
It's all on me  
Got my mind on the matter  
Sure as I tell ya  
Now you know that's right
