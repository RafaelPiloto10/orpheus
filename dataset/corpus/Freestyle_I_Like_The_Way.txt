Ever since the day we met  
I can'T get you out of my head  
somehow you'Ve put your spell on me  
I'Ve always been so hard to please  
but you work me with so much ease  
now it'S with you I wanna be  
Refrain I  
Coz I, I can see heaven in your eyes  
if only you would realize  
you are the only one for me  
you gotta see  
Chorus  
(I like the way),  
The way you smile  
(The way you move),  
It blows my mind  
(Hear me when I say),  
Coz honey I like the way you are  
I'M trying to understand  
each time you hold my hand  
I feel deep inside of me  
Coz' I'Ve never felt this way before  
wanting you more and more  
when we'Re alone it'S plain to see  
Refrain ii  
I long to feel your warm embrace  
your lovin' that no one can replace  
you are the only one for me  
you gotta see  
(Repeat chorus) (Adlib)  
(Repeat chorus till fade)
