Mornin' finds me at the table  
Sifting through your memories.  
I'd change your mind but I'm not able  
'Cause you were gone long before I could set you free.  
No more hearin' bad notes playin'  
Songs I don't believe any more.  
Cold wind blows and the rivers rise.  
Let the muddy waters slide.  
I think it's time to head for higher ground,  
Somethin' better in the sky.  
Time to spread my wings and fly.  
Heaven help me up to higher ground.  
Midnight sends its shiny darkness  
Throws a shadow on my dreams.  
I don't have time - time for broken hearted  
'Cause I'm all paid up on the tears you left for me.  
No more cryin', no more buyin'  
Into lies I don't believe - what you say.  
Cold wind blows and the rivers rise.  
Let the muddy waters slide.  
I think it's time to head for higher ground,  
Somethin' better in the sky.  
Time to spread my wings and fly.  
Heaven help me up to higher ground.  
Cold wind blows and the rivers rise.  
Let the muddy waters slide.  
I think it's time to head for higher ground,  
Somethin' better in the sky.  
Time to spread my wings and fly.  
Heaven help me up to higher ground.
