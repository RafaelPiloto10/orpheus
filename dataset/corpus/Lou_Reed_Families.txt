(how's the family)  
Mama, you tell me how's the family  
And papa, tell me how thing's going by you  
And little baby sister, I heard that you got married  
And I heard that you had yourself a little baby girl, too  
And here's some uncles and some cousins I know vaguely  
And would you believe my old dog chelsea's here, too  
And would you believe nobody in this family  
Wanted to keep her  
And now that dog's more of a part of this family  
Then I am, too  
I don't come home much anymore  
No-no-no I don't come home much anymore  
Mama  
And mama, I know how disappointed you are  
And papa, I know that you feel the same way, too  
And no-no-no-no-no I still haven't got married  
And no-no-no there's no grandson planned here for you  
And by the way, daddy tell me how's the business  
I understand that your stock she's growing very high  
No, daddy, you're not a poor man anymore  
And I hope you'll realize that before you die  
Because I don't come home much anymore  
No-no-no-no-no I don't come home much no more  
But daddy  
And please-please-please-please-please  
Come on let's not start this business again  
I know how much you resent the life that I have  
But one more time, I don't want the family business  
Don't want to inherit it upon the day that you die  
Really, daddy should have given it to my sister  
You know elisabeth, you know elisabeth  
She has a better head for those things than I  
She lives practically around the corner  
That's really the kind of child you could be proud of  
But papa, I know that this visit's a mistake  
There's nothing here we have in common, except our name  
And families that live out in the suburbs  
Often make each other cry  
And I don't think that I'll come home much anymore  
No-no, I don't think I'll come home much again  
Mama  
Papa  
Families  
Often make each other cry  
No, I don't think that I'll come home much anymore
