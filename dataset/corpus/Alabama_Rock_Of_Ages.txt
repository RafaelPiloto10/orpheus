Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy wounded side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Save from wrath and make me pure  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy wounded side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Save from wrath and make me pure  
While I draw this fleeting breath  
When my eyes shall close in death  
When I saw two worlds unknown  
And see beyond Thy golden throne  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Let me hide myself in Thee
