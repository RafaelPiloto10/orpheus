(This is one of the neighbors from down the street.  
This record of this music has been goin' on all afternoon  
and I'm sick and tired of it. If it doesn't stop I'm calling the police!)  
  
You got me on the run, you got it your way  
Now I'm feeling pretty good and I'm beginning to sweat  
Your love is so fine, it's got me feelin' alright  
Going out of my mind, I got to have you tonight  
  
The girl's so deep inside, like blood in my veins  
Never lets me hide, now I'm going insane  
It makes me climb the walls, bite my nails to the bone  
It's always by my side, it never leaves me alone  
  
[Chorus]  
When it's time to get tough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
Masculine  
  
I know that I'm a man from the spark in my soul  
It can make me so hot, you got out of control  
Grab her by the hair, drag her back to your cave  
It's what makes a man a man, people always stay the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm masculine  
  
(Masculine, masculine)  
  
Anytime, anyplace, anyway, in the heat of the night and in the dark of the day  
Anytime, anyplace, anyway  
  
When it's time to get tough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine - what d'you say?  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine  
  
When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine (masculine, masculine)  
If you push me I'll shove, I'm masculine  
When she wants to play rough, I'm masculine  
When she wants to make love, I'm masculine...
