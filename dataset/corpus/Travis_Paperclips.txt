Paperclips, melody  
Hold together all these memories  
Memories  
Memories  
I don't want to think at all  
  
I don't want to be like you anymore  
I don't want to see your face at my door  
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure  
I don't want to be like you anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
Take a trip, down memory lane  
You will never want to go again  
Take your leave  
Take your leave  
I don't want to sing at all  
  
I don't want to be like you anymore  
I don't want to see your face at my door  
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure  
I don't want to live like you anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
Ever talk, decide out  
We get by, we'll get by  
And I won't take this  
No more sadness, no, no  
  
Paperclips, memories  
Hold together all these melodies  
Melodies  
Melodies  
I don't want to sing at all  
  
I don't want to be like you anymore  
I don't want to see your face at my door  
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure  
I don't want to live like you anymore, anymore, anymore
