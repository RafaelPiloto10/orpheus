Oh, hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly  
It's so nice to have you back where you belong  
You're lookin' swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly  
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong  
We feel the room swayin' while the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs from way back when  
So, take her wrap fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas  
Dolly won't never ever go away again  
Hey, hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly  
It's really nice to have you back where you belong  
Girl, you're lookin' swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly  
Still glowin', still crowin', you're still goin' strong  
We feel the room swayin' while the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs from way back when  
So, take her wrap fellas, find her a big fat lap, fellas  
Dolly don't ever go away, Dolly don't you ever, ever go away  
Dolly don't you ever go away again
