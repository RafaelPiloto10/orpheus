Screams break the silence  
Waking from the dead of night  
Vengeance is boiling  
He's returned to kill the light  
Then when he's found who he's looking for  
Listen in awe and you'll hear him  
  
Bark at the moon  
  
Years spent in torment  
Buried in a nameless grave  
Now he has risen  
Miracles would have to save  
Those that the beast is looking for  
Listen in awe and you'll hear him  
  
Bark at the moon  
  
They cursed and buried him  
Along with shame  
And thought his timeless soul had gone  
In empty burning Hell-unholy one  
But now he's returned to prove them wrong  
  
Howling in shadows  
Living in a lunar spell  
He finds his heaven  
Spewing from the mouth of hell  
  
And when he finds who he's looking for  
Listen in awe and you'll hear him  
Bark at the moon
