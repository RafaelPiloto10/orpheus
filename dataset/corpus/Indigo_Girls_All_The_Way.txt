I wasn't looking to shift my direction  
My eyes straight ahead hands ten and two  
The gravity of our first connection  
Veering off the road and into you  
All the people drive by slowly gawking at the scene  
Of the smoldering inevitable spark and gasoline  
All the way I met you head on full speed  
At the heart the blue flame burns  
All the way I took the crash course impact  
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn  
No amount of playing safe could save me from this day  
The head seeking path of my trajectory  
Didn't we cooly divest of predestination  
Slamming into futures we can't see  
I know what can happen when there's more than meets the eye  
But there's no way to avoid it just get in the car and drive  
All the way I met you head on full speed  
At the heart the blue flame burns  
All the way I took crash course impact  
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn  
It makes me laugh, we?re talking over tea  
When I can still smell the smoke on my sleeve  
Steaming like gun smoke the wreckage of our past  
The scene of a crime I still can't leave  
Oh you and me, we should let well enough be  
But each revisitation points to clues  
There's the oil slick of uncertainty  
And warning signs back there we didn't use  
At least we laugh about it now how we escaped alive  
It's remarkable the mess we make and what we can survive  
(repeat chorus)
