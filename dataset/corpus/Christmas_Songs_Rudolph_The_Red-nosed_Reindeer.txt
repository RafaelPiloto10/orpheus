  
You know Dasher and dancer  
And Prancer and Vixen,  
Comet and Cupid  
And Donner and Blitzen.  
But do you recall  
The most famous reindeer of all?  
  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
(Reindeer)  
Had a very shiny nose  
(Like a light bulb)  
And if you ever saw it  
(Saw it)  
You would even say it glows  
(Like a flash light)  
All of the other reindeer  
(Reindeer)  
Used to laugh and call him names  
(Like Pinochio)  
They never let poor Rudolph  
(Rudolph)  
Play in any reindeer games  
(Like Monopoly)  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
(Ho Ho Ho)  
Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?  
Then all the reindeer loved him  
(Loved him)  
And they shouted out with glee  
(Yippee)  
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
(Reindeer)  
You'll go down in history!"  
(Like george washington )
