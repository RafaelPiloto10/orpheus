I used to talk about politics, politics, politics,  
I used to talk about politics but I don't anymore.  
I used to talk about communism, socialism, capitalism  
I used to talk about all those isms but now I'm a dad  
And all I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
I used to rant about traffic problems,  
Fender benders, stupid signs  
I used to fear an accident  
But now I stay at home  
And talk about:  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it's all brown and gooey  
Sometimes it looks like dijon mustard  
Sometimes it's like melted crayon  
Sometimes it just smells like POO  
  
I used to talk about philosophy,  
Kafka, Descartes, Socrates  
I used to think metaphysically  
But now I think the world evolves around:  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it feels just like stucco  
Sometimes it feels like Jell-o pudding  
Sometimes it's like avocado  
Sometimes she just pees on me  
  
I used to be real int'resting  
Discussing issues of the day  
But now I call up my MP  
And tell her all about my baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo
