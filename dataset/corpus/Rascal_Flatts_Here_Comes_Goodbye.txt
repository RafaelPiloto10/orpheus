I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road  
And its not like her to drive that slow, nothings on the radio  
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell  
She usually comes right in, now I can tell  
  
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time  
Here comes the start of every sleepless night  
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed  
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye  
  
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday  
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way  
One day I thought id see her with her daddy by her side  
And violins would play here comes the bride  
  
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time  
Here comes the start of every sleepless night  
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed  
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye  
  
Why does it have to go from good to gone?  
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone  
All alone, but here comes goodbye  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time  
Here comes the start of every sleepless night  
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed  
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
