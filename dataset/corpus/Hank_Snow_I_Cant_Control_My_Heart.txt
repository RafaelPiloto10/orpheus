Though I should say goodbye to you I can't control my heart  
It won't obey, my heart must stay with you  
You brought me a tear with each kiss you brought to me  
You taught me how painful love can be  
  
It makes no difference what you do I can't control my heart  
And though you stray my heart must stay with you  
For you alone it's beating, I love you it's repeating  
With all my soul I can't control my heart  
  
You brought me a tear with each kiss you brought to me  
You taught me how painful love can be  
It makes no difference what you do I can't control my heart  
And though you stray my heart must stay with you  
  
For you alone it's beating, I love you it's repeating  
With all my soul I can't control my heart
