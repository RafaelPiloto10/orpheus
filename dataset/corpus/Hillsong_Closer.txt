Verse  
There is no life without You  
You have all that we need  
Where You are  
Every fear is broken  
And the darkness must flee  
  
Chorus  
Closer and closer  
We want to know You  
Reaching out  
Reaching out  
Here in Your presence  
We want to go deeper  
In Your light  
Come alive  
  
Verse  
There is no one beside You  
You alone are enough  
You fling the doors of  
Your heart wide open  
And we are lost in Your love  
  
Bridge  
To You  
We will come running  
In You  
We find belonging  
Your love  
Is all that can satisfy
