It's not important for you to know my name -  
Nor I to know yours  
If we communicate for two minutes only  
It will be enough  
For knowing that someone in this world  
Feels as desperate as me -  
And what you give is what you get.  
  
It doesn't matter if we never meet again,  
What we have said will always remain.  
If we get through for two minutes only,  
It will be a start!  
For knowing that someone in this life,  
Loves with a passion called hate  
And what you give is what you get.  
  
If I never ever see you -  
If I never ever see you -  
If I never ever see you - again.  
  
And what you give is what you get!
