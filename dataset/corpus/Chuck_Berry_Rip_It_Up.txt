Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid  
I'm a fool away my money, don't try to save  
My heart says, "Go go, have a time"  
'cause Saturday night bar and I'm feelin' fine  
  
I'm gonna rock it up, I'll rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up, I'm gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it, ball tonight  
  
I got a date and I won't be late  
Pickin' her up in my '88  
Cruise on down 'bout the union hall  
John starts jumpin', we'll have a ball  
  
Gonna rock it up, yes, I'm gonna rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up, I'm gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it and ball tonight  
  
'Long about ten and I'm swingin' high  
Me and my baby, rocking up in the sky  
Don't care if I spend my dollar  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul  
  
I'm gonna rock it up, I'll rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up, I'm gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it and ball tonight
