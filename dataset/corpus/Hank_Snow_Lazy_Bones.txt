Long as there is chicken gravy on your rice,  
Ev'rything is nice.  
Long as there's watermelon on the vine,  
Ev'rything is fine.  
  
You got no time to work,  
You got no time to play,  
Busy doin' nothin' all the live long day.  
You won't ever change no matter what I say,  
You're just made that way.  
  
Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun,  
How you 'spec' to get your day's work done?  
Sleepin' in the noonday sun.  
Lazybones, sleepin' in the shade,  
  
How you 'spec' to get your corn meal made?  
Never get your corn meal made  
Sleepin' in the evenin' shade.  
  
When 'taters need sprayin',  
I bet you keep prayin'  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you fo fishin'  
I bet you keep wishin'  
The fish won't grab at your line.  
  
Lazybones, loafin' through the day,  
Now you 'spec' to make a dime that way?  
Never make a dime that way  
(Well looky here)  
He never heard a word I say!
