Take for example when you go to the movies these days, you know  
They try to sell you this jumbo drink, eight extra ounces of watered  
down cherry coke for an extra twenty five cents. I don't want it  
I don't want that much organization in my life  
I don't want other people thinking for me  
I want my Junior Mints  
Where did the Junior Mints go in the movies  
I don't want a twelve lb. Nestle's crunch for twenty five dollars  
I want Junior Mints  
  
"We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers  
We need people that care! I'm mad as hell  
And I don't want to take it anymore  
  
Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  
Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  
Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  
In the middle of the week  
Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  
Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  
There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us  
  
Paradise, lost and found  
Paradise, take a look around  
I was out in California where I hear they have it all  
They got riots, fires, mud slides  
They've got sushi in the mall  
Water bars, brontosaurs, Chinese modern lust  
Shake and bake life with the quake  
The secret's in the crust  
  
We lost our Martian rocket ship  
The high paid spokesman said  
Looks like that silly rocket ship  
Has lost its cone shaped head  
We spent ninety jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars  
I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars  
  
Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa  
Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa  
  
Where's the church, who took the steeple  
Religion is in the hands of some crazy-ass people  
Television preachers with bad hair and dimples  
The god's honest truth is it's not that simple  
It's the Buddhist in you, it's the Pagan in me  
It's the Muslim in him, she's Catholic ain't she?  
It's the born again look its the WASP and the Jew  
Tell me what's goin on, I ain't gotta clue  
  
She said you gotta do your fair share  
Now cough up half the rent  
I treat my body like a temple  
You treat yours like a tent  
But the right word at the right time  
May get me a little hug  
That's the difference between lightning  
And a harmless lightnin' bug  
  
We're seven years from the millennium  
That's a science fiction fact  
Stanley Kubrick and his buddy HAL  
Now don't look that abstract  
So I'll put on my Bob Marley tape  
And practice what I preach  
Get Jah lost in the reggae mon  
As I walk along the beach  
Stay in touch with my insanity really is the only way  
Its a jungle out there kiddies  
Have a very fruitful day  
Hey
