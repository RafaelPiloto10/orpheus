Oh love is no colour, love is emotion  
It's like heaven here to me  
And love is the answer, to all of your questions  
Love is like eternity  
I'll love you forever  
And I miss your lonely heart  
Can we stay together, oh baby don't you tear apart  
  
My lonely girl  
Oh lonely hearts and lonely memories  
You are my lonely girl  
You are destiny  
My lonely girl, come hear my heart  
I'll be only there for you  
My lonely girl, we'll try a start  
You are heaven, swear it's true  
  
Love is the reason, that I'm living  
sometimes lonely, sometimes pain  
Love is a stranger, to all of your questions  
Love is never be the same  
Love is like an ocean  
You can run but you can't hide  
The greatest devotion, baby can't you see the light  
  
You're like an orchestra of angels  
And I never, I never let you go
