Flashing lights, lights  
Flashing lights, lights  
Flashing lights, lights  
  
She don't believe in shootin' stars  
But she believe in shoes and cars  
Wood floors in the new apartment  
Couture from the store's department  
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit  
I'm more of the, trips to Florida  
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water  
Straight from the page of your favorite author  
And the weather so breezy  
Man why can't life always be this easy  
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy  
I get a call like where are you Yeezy  
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'  
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi  
Damn, these niggas got me  
I hate these niggas more than the Nazi  
  
As I recall, I know you love to show off  
But I never thought that you would take it this far  
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights  
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights  
  
I know it's been a while  
Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing  
I know I was foul bay-bay  
A-bay lately you been all on my brain  
And if somebody would've told me a month ago  
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know  
If somebody would've told me a year ago  
It'd go, get this difficult  
Feeling like Katrina with no fema  
Like Martin with no Gina  
Like a flight with no visa  
First class with the seat back I still see ya  
In my past, you on the other side of the glass  
Of my memory's museum  
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa  
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar  
  
As I recall, I know you love to show off  
But I never thought that you would take it this far  
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights  
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights  
  
As you recall, you know I love to show off  
But you never thought that I would take it this far  
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights  
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights  
  
Flashing lights, lights  
Flashing lights, lights  
  
Lights, lights, lights, lights
