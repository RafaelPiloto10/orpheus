When everything  
When everything was out of reach  
The sky was up  
The ground was right below our feet  
  
We played in toes  
We played in toes  
Cardboard boxes  
We played in boxes  
We played in boxes  
Cardboard boxes  
  
We wasted time  
We wasted time before we knew  
Don't punch the clock  
Or time will run away with you  
  
We live in boxes  
We live in boxes  
Concrete boxes  
We live in boxes  
We live in boxes  
Concrete boxes  
  
Now your childhood is over  
You're a man they have said  
You silently shoulder  
All the plans they have made  
You pack down your boxes and ask  
Who am I?  
  
The biggest trick  
The biggest trick they play on you  
To make you think  
The show won't go on without you  
  
We go in boxes  
We go in boxes  
Wooden boss  
We go in boxes  
We go in boxes  
Wooden boxes  
  
Now the room has been emptied  
I'm alone in my bed  
The heart is a box  
Which the soul has fled  
The spell has been broken  
And the last word is said
