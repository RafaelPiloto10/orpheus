Some folks say smoking herb is a crime,  
If they catch you smokin' they're bound to drop the dime  
Insufferable informa crazy fools wait  
With their fingers crossed for you to break the rules  
And in the evening when we try to jam,  
We like the music loud in this here band  
We let the bass line drop as loud as we can stand  
Somebody always gotta turn informa for the man  
I want to know right now is there one of you in the crowd are you gonna  
Call 911  
And spoil all of my fun  
You crazy fool I'm in the mood  
Get ready come on now, load up the bong, crank up the song,  
Let the informa call 911  
And when security police force want to arrive  
Don't try to run, don't try to hide  
Just pull out the nine, pop in the clip  
And let one slip into these crazy fools
