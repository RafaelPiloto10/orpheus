On a ship to nowhere  
On a dark and tranquil sea  
I'm sinking with a cargo  
Of the things that cannot be  
On the far horizon  
The final sunsets fall  
And tuesday becomes wednesday  
Becomes any day at all  
  
Everything we do  
Nothing remains true  
I am frightened I'm a liar  
And I'm tortured by desire  
Every single day  
In all the simple ways  
I am torn apart inside  
By the things I've tried to hide  
  
Down the dusty roads we go  
And down the leafy lanes  
And down the long and winding road  
The landscape stays the same  
  
Everything we do  
Nothing remains true  
I am frightened I'm a liar  
And I'm tortured by desire  
Every single day  
In all the simple ways  
I am torn apart inside  
By the things I've tried to hide  
  
Everything we do  
Nothing remains true  
I am frightened I'm a liar  
And I'm tortured by desire  
Every single day  
In all the simple ways  
I am torn apart inside  
By the things I've tried to hide
