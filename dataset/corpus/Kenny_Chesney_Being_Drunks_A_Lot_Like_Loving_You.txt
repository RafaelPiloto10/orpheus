Well I drank till I stumbled,  
I drank till I fell,  
When the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell.  
I know about drinkin',  
So I know one things true,  
Being drunk's a lot like loving you  
  
'Cause I loved till I stumbled,  
I loved till I fell,  
When the loving was over it hurt me like hell.  
Now I what a taste of the wrong love can do,  
Being drunk's a lot like lovin' you  
  
And I've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink,  
And, at that I've done reasonably, well I think.  
But I haven't done well swearing off you and me  
At that I've failed miserably.  
  
Well I felt the hangover of loving all night.  
I've sat at the bar all alone in a fight.  
I've bottled up feelings, and poured them out too,  
Being drunk's a lot like loving you.  
  
And I've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink,  
And, at that I've done reasonably, well I think.  
But I haven't done well swearing off you and me  
At that I've failed miserably.  
  
Well I drank till I stumbled,  
I loved till I fell,  
When the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell.  
Now I know about drinkin' so I know one things true,  
Being drunk's a lot like loving you.  
  
Though I know what a taste of the wrong love can do,  
Sometimes I still get drunk loving you.
