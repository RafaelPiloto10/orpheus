Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Some people work very hard,  
But still they never get it right.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Now I'm beginning to see the light.  
  
Wine in the morning  
And some breakfast at night.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Here we go again  
Playing the fool again.  
Here we go again  
Acting hard again.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Now I'm beginning to see the light.  
  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
I'm beginning to see the light.  
I wore my teeth in my hands  
So I could mess the hair of the night  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Hey I'm beginning to see the light.  
I met myself in a dream  
And I just want to tell you  
Everything was alright  
I'm beginning to see the light.  
Here comes two of you,  
Which one will you chose?  
One is black, one is blue.  
Don't look just what to do.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Now I'm beginning to see the light.  
  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
Some people work very hard  
But still they never get it right  
Well I'm beginning to see the light.  
There are problems in these times  
But none of them are mine  
Baby, I'm beginning to see the light.  
Here we go again,  
I thought that you were my friend.  
Here we go again,  
I thought that you were my friend.  
How does it feel to be loved?  
How does it feel to be loved?
