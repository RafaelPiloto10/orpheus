I used to wake up in the morning  
I used to feel so bad  
I got so sick of having sleepless nights  
I went and told my dad  
  
He said, "Son now here's some little something"  
And stuck them on my wall  
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely  
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all  
  
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful  
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night  
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems  
Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright  
  
Pictures of Lily  
Lily, oh Lily  
Lily, oh Lily  
Pictures of Lily  
  
And then one day things weren't quite so fine  
I fell in love with Lily  
I asked my dad where Lily I could find  
He said, "Son, now don't be silly"  
  
"She's been dead since 1929"  
Oh, how I cried that night  
If only I'd been born in Lily's time  
It would have been alright  
  
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful  
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night  
  
For me and Lily are together in my dreams  
And I ask you, "Hey mister, have you ever seen"  
"Pictures of Lily?"
