Only love  
Can make it rain  
The way the beach  
Is kissed by the sea  
  
Only love  
Can make it rain  
Like the sweat of lovers  
Laying in the fields  
  
Love, reign o'er me  
Love, reign o'er me, rain on me  
Rain on me  
  
Only love  
Can bring the rain  
That makes you yearn  
To the sky  
  
Only love  
Can bring the rain  
That falls like tears  
From on high  
  
Love, reign o'er me  
Reign o'er me, oh rain on me  
Love, reign o'er me, rain on me  
Rain on me  
  
On the dry and dusty road  
The nights we spend apart alone  
I need to get back home  
To cool cool rain  
  
I can't sleep and I lay and I think  
The nights are hot and black as ink  
Oh God, I need a drink  
Of cool cool rain  
  
Love, reign o'er me  
Reign o'er me, o'er me  
Love, reign o'er me, rain on me  
Love
