Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
Oh what fun it is to ride,  
In a one-horse open sleigh,  
Hey!  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
Oh what fun it is to ride,  
In a one-horse open sleigh!  
  
Dashing through the snow (jingle, jing, jing, jingle!)  
In a one-horse open sleigh (jingle, jing, jing, jingle!)  
Over the fields we go (o'er the fields, jingle, jingle!)  
Laughing all the way!  
Bells on Bob-Tail ring (jingle, jing, jing, jingle!)  
Making spirits bright (la, la, la la!)  
What fun it is to ride and sing,  
A sleighing song tonight!  
  
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
Oh what fun it is to ride,  
In a one-horse open sleigh,  
Hey!  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
Oh what fun it is to ride,  
In a one-horse open sleigh!  
  
A day or two ago (A day or two ago)  
I thought I'd take a ride (I thought I'd take a ride)  
And soon Miss Fanny Bride (And soon Miss Fanny Bride)  
Was seated by my side  
(The horse was lean and lank)  
Misfortune seemed his lot,  
He got into a drifted bank,  
And we  
We got up sot!  
  
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
(Oh what fun it is to ride)  
In a one-horse open sleigh  
Hey!  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
(Oh what fun it is to ride)  
In a one-horse open sleigh  
Hey!  
  
Now the ground is white (jingle, jing, jing, jingle!)  
Go it while you're young (jingle, jing, jing, jingle!)  
Take the girls tonight (Take the girls tonight)  
And sing this sleighing song  
Just get a Bob-Tailed Nag (jingle, jing, jing, jingle!)  
Two-forty for his speed  
Then hitch 'em to an open sleigh,  
An' crack you'll take the lead!  
  
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
Oh what fun it is to ride,  
In a one-horse open sleigh,  
Hey!  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,  
Jingle all the way!  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh!
