I'm far from home,  
And tired of this place,  
I miss your good, good love  
And your sweet embrace  
Can't sleep at night  
With you on my mind,  
I just want to run to you, baby,  
Leave it all behind  
  
'Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song,  
I'm coming home to you, baby,  
Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love,  
That's all I need,  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it on home to me  
  
Sometimes in my life  
I don't know what to do,  
Tho' I'm weak for myself  
I try to be strong for you.  
You're there when I need you,  
After all these years,  
So I send you this letter, baby,  
Written in tears  
  
'Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song,  
I'm coming home to you, baby, baby,  
Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love,  
That's all I need,  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it on home to me  
  
'Cause it seems so long  
Since I heard your song,  
I'm coming home to you, baby,  
Back where I belong  
  
Your precious love,  
That's all I need,  
Angel spread your wings  
And bring it, bring it, bring on home  
  
Your precious love, your precious love,  
That's all that I need.  
Angel spread your wings and  
Bring it, bring it, bring on home  
Bring it baby, baby, that's all I want.  
  
Your precious love  
Your precious love, that's all I need  
Your precious love, your precious love  
Your precious love, that's all I need  
C'mon bring on home, baby  
Won't you bring on home  
I need your love
