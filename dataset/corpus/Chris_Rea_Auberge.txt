On the hard fast train  
On the road to gain  
Something gets right through to your telling bone  
There's a sudden itch  
An electric twitch  
Sometimes I swear this body's got a mind of its own  
This is the naked truth  
This is the light  
There's only one place left to go  
  
Auberge  
  
You meet a silent type  
On a windy trail  
With a shiny cloak and an unseen silver dagger  
You can talk till you ache  
Give yourself one more break  
You can tell by the look on his face  
that it just doesn't matter  
This is the naked truth  
This is the light  
There's only one place left to go  
  
Auberge  
  
Give me a weekend  
Give me a day  
Don't like what I'm seeing though I hear what you say  
Think with a dagger  
And you'll die on your knees  
Begging for mercy  
Singing please mister please  
This is the naked truth  
This is the light  
There's only one place left to go  
  
Auberge
