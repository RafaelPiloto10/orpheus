Dreamtime begins  
Where every song is the perfect place  
Words never spoken  
Are the strongest resounding  
  
Life force is meant for us  
To remember the stars, the earth  
Still we forget  
So asleep in this dreamtime  
Lost in this dreamtime day  
  
Take me up into that freedom place and justify  
Electrify the senses sharpen than the soul intensify  
Nominate that we can break out take, take, take together  
Hesitate and you will dance on this earth, to forever  
  
You are the choice forever trying  
Give you wings forever flying  
You can fly, you can glide, you can dream  
You can see through this interactive vision streaming  
  
You've got the faith  
So busy trying  
So let it go  
Fovever flying  
  
To the sky, to the earth, to the moon, to the sea  
To the sun, to the stars, to the dream you become  
  
Nothing left to lose  
Nothing more to prove  
With wings of gold  
You'll fly away  
  
Talk among the prophets  
Give you something  
Talk among the teachers  
Tell you something  
Talk among your one true self now  
Forever, forever, forever, forever
