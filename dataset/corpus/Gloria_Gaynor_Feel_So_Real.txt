Feel, feel, feel  
  
Feel so real  
I feel so real  
I feel so real  
And I owe it all to you  
  
Oh, I feel so nice  
With you here by my side  
If I just do the best that I can do  
It seems that's enough for you  
  
The little things mean so much  
A smile or a joyful touch  
That push that keeps me going strong  
To know that I belong  
  
And I feel so real  
I feel so real  
I feel so real  
And I owe it all to you  
  
Hey, feel so real  
I feel so real  
Oh, I feel so real  
And I owe it all to you  
  
Love is such a wonderful thing  
The angels sing when freedom reigns  
Freedom from the chains  
That hold us back from harmony  
  
I'm right here on my knees  
To thank you for the air that I breath  
I thank you for the life that you have saved  
That's why I've got to say  
  
Feel so real  
I feel so real  
Oh, I feel so real  
And I owe it all to you, you  
  
Hey, feel so real  
I feel so real  
I feel so real  
And I owe it all to you  
  
Feel so real  
Feel so real  
Feel so real  
  
Feel so real  
Feel so real  
Feel so real
