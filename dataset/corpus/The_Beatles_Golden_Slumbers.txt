Once there was a way,  
To get back homeward.  
  
Once there was a way  
To get back home.  
  
Sleep, pretty darling,  
Dot not cry  
And I will sing a lullaby.  
  
Golden slumbers,  
Fill your eyes  
Smiles await you when you rise  
Sleep pretty darling  
Do not cry  
And I will sing a lullaby.  
  
Once there was a way  
To get back homeward  
  
Once there was a way  
To get back home  
  
Sleep, pretty darling  
Do not cry  
And I will sing a lullaby.
