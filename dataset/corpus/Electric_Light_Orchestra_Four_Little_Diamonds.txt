I used to think she was the greatest thing  
I really cared, gave her a diamond ring  
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me  
Well I never saw her face since then  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
She must be somewhere on the open road  
She always said she was a lonely one  
She gets you down with her tales of woe  
She took me for everything  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things we'd done  
But where could she run- she ran away  
There's just no answer to give  
  
I keep wonderin' about her, day and night  
She probably thinks I was a fool- she's right  
She don't know it  
But I'm gonna keep on searchin' for that woman  
I'm gonna search everywhere  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things we'd done  
But where could she run- she ran away  
There's just no answer to give  
  
I still hear her callin' out to me  
I still listen for her endlessly  
But it never even crossed my mind she was a cheater  
I gotta find where she hides  
'Cause if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds
