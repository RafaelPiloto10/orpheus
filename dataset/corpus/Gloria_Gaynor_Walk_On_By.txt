You always said my eyes  
Were the windows of my soul  
You could always fill my love  
And pain without been told  
I never knew how, but I don't  
Even dare to look at you now.  
  
So, if you see me walking down the street  
And I start to cry each time we leave  
Walk on by, walk on by  
  
Make believe  
That you don't see the tears  
Just let me grieve  
In private 'cause each time I see you  
I break down and cry, ooh baby,  
Walk on by, ooh darling  
Please, walk on by,  
I don't want to you to see me cry  
Walk on by, please, please  
Baby, baby don't stop  
  
So, if you ever love  
Look the other way  
There is anything left to say  
Anyway  
  
I just can't get over losing you  
And so if I seem broken and blue  
Walk on by, walk on by  
  
Foolish pride  
Is all that I have left  
So let me hide  
The tears and the sadness you gave me  
When you said goodbye, ooh baby  
Walk on by, oh sugar  
Walk on by (baby, baby don't stop)  
  
Baby, baby don't stop  
Walk on by,  
Walk on by  
Foolish pride  
Is all that I have left  
So let me hide  
The tears and the sadness you gave me  
When you said goodbye  
Walk on by, baby  
Walk on by, sugar  
Walk on by, walk on by  
  
I don't want to see me cry  
Walk on by, walk on by,  
All the tears that I have cry,  
I don't have nothing left to say,  
Please take your head, look the other way,  
Wow, wow, wow, walk on by,  
Walk on by
