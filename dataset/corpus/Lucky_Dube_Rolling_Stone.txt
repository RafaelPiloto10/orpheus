Call me when you' re ready yeah  
Call me when your head is right  
She said the words and walked into the sunset  
Like a cowboy  
He was standing there like he got up  
From a bad dream  
And he said she wanted something  
He could not give her (commitment)  
He is one of the men I know  
Who have chosen loneliness  
And called it freedom  
That' s why he always says  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m a rolling stone  
'Cause a rolling stone  
Gathers no moss  
  
She told him once before  
She' s not getting any younger you know  
And when you look at her face  
The years are showing  
She is one of the women I know  
Who wants it all in life (commitment)  
He is one of the men I know  
Who've taken loneliness  
And called it freedom  
That' s why he always says  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m a rolling stone  
'Cause a rolling stone  
Gathers no moss
