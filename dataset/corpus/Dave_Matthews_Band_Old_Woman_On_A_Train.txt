Caught the train from Warrabrook  
All the way into Hornsby.  
But somehow we got stuck  
Next to a fat spastic old lady.  
  
She had a stereo  
And a granny pram.  
A big fat ugly gut  
And a pink bum-bag.

All stations to Central.  
She's been herer since New Castle.  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp'  
  
Yeah. Yeah.

She had some Choc-Wheaton's  
Some plastic tupperware.  
She hated all Asians  
Cause "they're not from round here"  
  
Yeah - Yeah!  
  
All stations to Central.  
She's been herer since New Castle.  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp'  
  
Yeah. Yeah.
