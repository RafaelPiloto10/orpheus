For those who fancy coloring books  
As certain people do  
Here's a new one for you  
A most unusual coloring book  
The kind you never see  
Crayons ready, very well  
Begin to color me  
  
These are the eyes that watched him  
As he walked away  
Color them gray  
This is the heart that thought  
He would always be true  
Color it blue  
These are the arms that held him  
  
And touched him then lost him somehow  
Color them empty now  
These are the beads I wore  
Until she came between  
Color them green  
This is the room I sleep in  
Walk in and weep in  
Hide in that nobody sees  
Color it lonely, please  
This is the man  
The one I depended upon  
Color him gone...
