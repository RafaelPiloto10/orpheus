Definite goodbye until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye  
  
Can't be together, we can't be apart  
We tried to get it right with a brand new start  
I really thought we would stick till the end  
But some things are never meant...  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye  
  
Right now I can't see a life without you  
I don't know where I am,  
I don't know where to go  
Our love is too deep, we can not be friends  
So this is where it all ends....  
  
I know tomorrow there's a new day  
That separation is the best way  
But all good moments are worth fighting for  
So hold me just once more...  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye until we say goodbye  
Definite goodbye  
  
I give you a kiss for moments like this  
We don't need to speak to know what we're gonna miss  
I'm holding you tight and after a while  
We can't stop our tears from falling..  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me cry one more tear  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye  
  
Let me stay for a while  
Let me lay down by your side one last time  
Let me cry one more tear  
Let me hold you in my arms until we say goodbye
