Woman, I have to leave you  
I can't stay where there is no pay  
And I don't care where I'm goin' to  
It's been so long since I've been gone  
Lord I'm tired and I want to go home  
My throat is raw from singing the blues  
  
Need all my friends to talk to  
Now yes I do  
Need all my friends to talk to  
  
I'm gonna search around until I find a friend  
Who will believe in me for what I am  
Sing my song 'til it hurts  
  
Play my music 'til I hit pay dirt  
Now I've got to sing my song  
Play my music, do the things I love  
  
It's been so long since I've been gone  
Lord I'm tired and I want to go home  
My throat is raw from singing the blues  
  
Need all my friends to talk to  
Now yes I do  
Need all my friends to talk to
