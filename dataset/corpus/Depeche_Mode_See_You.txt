All I want to do is see you again  
Is that too much to ask for?  
I just want to see your sweet smile  
Smile the way it was before  
Well I'll try not to hold you  
And I'll try not to kiss you  
  
And I won't even touch you  
All I want to do is see you  
Don't you know that it's true  
  
I remember the days when we'd walk through the woods  
And sit on a bench for a while  
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play  
And look in each others eyes  
You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance  
  
But I swear I won't touch you  
All I want to do is see you  
Don't you know that it's true  
  
Well I know five years is a long time  
And that times change (oh that times change)  
But I think that you will find  
People are basically the same (basically the same)  
If the water's still flowing, we can go for a swim  
And do the things we used to do  
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in  
And we can relive our youth  
Oh but we'll stay friendly like sister and brother  
  
Though I think I still love you  
All I want to do is see you  
Don't you know that it's true?
