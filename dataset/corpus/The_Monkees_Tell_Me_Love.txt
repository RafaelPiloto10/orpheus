Oh tell me, love, and tell me truly  
Do you believe this is forever?  
Well I tell you, love, that I believe you  
Oh, when you tell me that you will leave me never  
  
Oh tell me, love, that all my words are a waste  
Oh tell me, love, are my lips to your taste?  
'Cause I want to please you, I want to please you  
And tell me, love, do you know you amaze me?  
You keep changing for the better with every passing day  
Well, I'll tell you, love, sometimes it kinda scares me  
I've got to keep on getting to you, so you don't get away  
  
Oh tell me, love, that all my words are a waste  
And tell me, love, are my lips to your taste?  
'Cause I want to please you, I want to please you  
And tell me, love, please tell me, love, tell me, love
