18 was yesterday today she was  
A woman in every single way  
Abigail was walking in the forest where  
The darkness, it seems to be alive  
  
It was hours ago that she left her home  
The chapel in which Black Horsemen saved and raised her soul  
And now in the darkest night a storm was born  
And Abigail, she did not know...she was its prey  
  
Solo: Andy  
  
In the storm itself a monster came alive  
Chasing Abigail, lightning from the sky  
  
Ah...then her face turned white  
Never did she see the EYE that cried  
Raindrops on her head, weeping for the dead, rain...rain...  
Turning red  
  
Oh no...Let me go back to my home...Oh no...  
  
Solo: Mike  
  
God he looked away the night the storm it came  
And Abigail was drawn into the rain  
  
Rain...was pulling on her hair  
To where there is a mansion...THE LAIR  
Lurking in the dark when lightning struck again  
The mansion showed itself...in silhouette  
  
Solo: Mike  
  
Ah...rusty iron gates  
This is where the Little One she waits  
Raindrops on her head, weeping for the dead, rain...rain...rain  
Turning red  
  
Oh no... Let me go back to my home...Oh no... Oh...  
Seeing the Little One...knowing that she was a ghost...  
Abigail wondering why she was  
Mummified...a lantern in her hand  
And in the light she saw a name:  
Count de La Fey
