He wants to dream like a young man  
With the wisdom of an old man.  
He wants his home and security.  
He wants to live like a sailor at sea.  
Beautiful loser, where you gonna fall?  
You realize you just don't need it all.  
  
He's your oldest and your best friend,  
If you need him, he'll be there again.  
He's always willing to be second best,  
A perfect lodger, a perfect guest.  
Beautiful loser, read it on the wall  
And realize, you just don't need it all.  
Hey - you just don't need it all.  
You can try but you can't have it all, oh no, no.  
Oh, oh, can't have it all.  
  
He'll never make any enemies,  
He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze.  
He'll always ask, he'll always say please.  
Beautiful loser, never take it all  
Cause it's easier and faster when you fall,  
You just don't need it all  
Oh, oh, you just don't need it all.
