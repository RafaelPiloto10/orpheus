Blues Run the Game Lyrics  
Written by Jackson C. Frank  
  
Catch a boat to England, baby,  
Maybe to Spain,  
Wherever I have gone,  
Wherever I've been and gone,  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues have run the game.  
  
Send out for whisky, baby,  
Send out for gin,  
Me and room service, honey,  
Me and room service, babe,  
Me and room service  
Well, we're living a life of sin  
  
When I ain't drinking, baby,  
You are on my mind,  
When I ain't sleeping, honey,  
When I ain't sleeping, Mama,  
When I ain't sleeping  
Well you know you'll find me crying.  
  
Catch a boat to England, baby,  
Maybe to Spain,  
Wherever I have gone,  
Wherever I've been and gone,  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues have run the game.  
  
Living is a gamble, baby,  
Loving's much the same,  
Wherever I have played,  
Wherever I throw those dice,  
Wherever I have played  
The blues have run the game.  
  
Maybe when I'm older, baby,  
Someplace down the line,  
I'll wake up older,  
So much older, Mama,  
Wake up older  
And I'll just stop all my trying.  
  
Catch a boat to England, baby,  
Maybe to Spain,  
Wherever I have gone,  
Wherever I've been and gone,  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues, they're all the same.
