If you get to feelin' all alone  
When your good time friends have all got up and gone  
Don't come knockin' around my door  
Because I've heard your lines before  
  
[Chorus]  
And there ain't gonna be a next time this time  
'Cause woman startin' right now  
I'm gonna forget you name and your pretty face, girl  
And write you off as a bad mistake  
You know that some women, they are lovers  
And some just got no sense  
But a woman like you oughta be ashamed  
Of the things that you do to men  
  
If you get to feeling all alone  
When you find that you can't make it on your own  
Don't come knockin' around my door  
You see I've seen your act before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you get to feelin' you were wrong  
Don't go wastin' your good money on the phone  
'Cause I can hang up as fast as you can call  
And that ain't all  
  
And there ain't gonna be a next time this time  
'Cause woman startin' right now  
I'm gonna forget you name and your pretty face, girl  
And write you off as a complete disgrace  
You know that some women they are liars  
And some just got no sense  
But a woman like you oughta be ashamed  
Of the things that you do to men  
  
Yeah a woman like you oughta be ashamed  
Of the things that you do to men
