I will follow Him,  
Follow Him wherever He may go,  
And near Him, I always will be  
For nothing can keep me away,  
He is my destiny.  
  
I will follow Him,  
Ever since He touched my heart I knew,  
There isn't an ocean too deep,  
A mountain so high it can keep,  
Keep me away, away from His love.  
  
I love Him, I love Him, I love Him,  
And where He goes,  
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow.  
  
I will follow Him,  
Follow Him wherever He may go,  
There isn't an ocean too deep,  
A mountain so high it can keep,  
Keep me away, away from His love...  
  
I love Him  
(Oh yes I love Him)  
I'll follow  
(I'm gonna follow)  
True love  
(He'll always be my true, true love)  
Forever  
(Now until forever)  
I love Him, I love Him, I love Him,  
And where He goes,  
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow,  
He'll always be my true love,  
My true love, my true love,  
From now until forever,  
Forever, forever...  
  
There isn't an ocean too deep,  
A mountain so high it can keep,  
Keep me away, away from His love
