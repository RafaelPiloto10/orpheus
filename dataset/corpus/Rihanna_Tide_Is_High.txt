(Kardinal Offishall)  
Life is up everybody  
(Rihanna)  
The tide is high  
But I'm holding on  
I'm gonna be your numba 1  
I'm gonna want numba 1  
  
(Kardinal Offishall)  
She just my one time lover  
Pretty little thing  
Nothin but a pretty woman  
That I'd fling  
She even knows  
She want to be  
The queen to my king  
She ain't nothin  
But where I...  
Someone that I would use  
To boss my  
She wouldn't know  
She  
On the left on the rest  
Numba 2 on my mind  
There no way  
She could be my girl  
She steady while tryin  
To come into my world  
  
(Rihanna)  
The tide is high  
But I'm holding on  
I'm gonna be your numba 1  
I'm gonna want numba 1  
  
(Kardinal Offishall)  
She just my trophy piece  
Only I I  
Never ever want to call her  
Never ever want to bring her  
Around my friends  
She'd be cryin on the phone  
But she know who I am  
  
Voice to the people  
Family says I leave her  
I don't have time  
For the play play  
She a good chick yo  
But I'm married to the  
Related  
To the related to the paper  
Tryin to get my name  
Put it on the skyscraper  
There's no way  
She could be my wife  
She steady while  
Tryin' to come into my life  
  
(Rihanna)  
The tide is high  
But I'm holding on  
I'm gonna be your numba 1  
I'm gonna want numba 1  
  
Those other girls  
Ain't nothing like me  
Just give me the chance  
And boy you will see that  
I'm not the kind of girl  
Who just gets down like that  
(Kardinal Offishall)  
On the rim  
I ain't gonna front you  
The box to the a lot  
Hound dogs on the hunt  
You the push  
To the to a letter push roll  
You the artist and the  
But you aint what I want  
I want this this tryin  
Get in the business  
Just tryin walk visit...  
There's no way  
You could get that ring  
But I hear... In the place  
(Rihanna)  
The tide is high  
But I'm holding on  
(The tide is high)  
I'm gonna be your numba 1  
(Numba 1)  
I'm gonna want numba 1  
  
The tide is high  
But I'm holding on  
(Holding on)  
I'm gonna be your numba 1  
I'm gonna want numba 1  
  
(Kardinal Offishall)  
Life is up everybody
