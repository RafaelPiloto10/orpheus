Loneliness is always looking for a friend  
It found me once and it has been around since then  
Loneliness is never waiting by the door  
It sweeps right through and it will never be ignored  
Why, why was I chosen?  
Why am I left without?  
  
The Love of my life, the love that I need  
The love that they say is in life for free  
The love of dreams, the love that I want  
Loneliness knows me by name  
  
Loneliness knows everything I keep inside  
My endless thoughts in the silence of the night  
Loneliness is the one who made me see  
Ain't nobody else who can make a change but me  
Why, why was I chosen?  
Why am I left without?  
  
The Love of my life, the love that I need  
The love that they say is in life for free  
The love of dreams, the love that I want  
Loneliness knows me by name  
  
Less is more and that would be the vacant space  
The cried out tears and a never ending maze  
I have found what only loneliness provides  
A strength within knowing I will find
