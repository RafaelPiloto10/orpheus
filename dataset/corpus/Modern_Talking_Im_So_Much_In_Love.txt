Girl, You Know - I Will Away's Alway's Think Of You.....  
  
Oh, I'm So Much In Love - I Can't Live Without You  
I'm So Much In Love - I Always Think Of You  
I'm So Much In Love - I Can't Live Without You  
I'm So Much In Love - Oh, See What I Can Do.....  
  
Oh, Can You Hear The Sound Of My Tears?  
Love Is A Light And Love Is A Fear  
Oh, That's No Way To Say Goodbye  
Give Me One More Chance - Just One More Try  
  
And Let Me Be In Your Arms Again  
'Cause My Love Will Have No End  
Let Me Be In Your Arms Again  
Let Us Walking Hand In Hand  
  
Oh, Why Oh Why - Your Love Can't Stay?  
Your Turning Night Baby Into Day  
And When The Night Is Falling From The Sky  
It's Better That You Are By My Side
