Everybody was born in it  
Sure as hell gonna die in it  
Some people don't give a shit  
Whether or not they're full of it  
  
It's on my mind most of the time  
That's when you find we all go blind  
Then it will start to get in our hearts  
It's gone too far, that's who we are  
  
It's a monster  
We all have within us  
It's a monster  
It's a monster  
Turns us into sinners  
It's a monster  
  
It started when I played with it  
It turned into a habit  
And after that once you've been bit  
You can't seem to get rid of it  
  
It's on my mind most of the time  
That's when you find we all go blind  
Then it will start to get in our hearts  
It's gone too far, that's who we are  
  
It's a monster  
We all have within us  
It's a monster  
It's a monster  
Turns us into sinners  
It's a monster
