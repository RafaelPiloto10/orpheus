There ain't no space and time  
To keep our love alive  
We have existence and it's all we share  
There ain't no real truth  
There ain't no real lies  
Keep on pushin' 'cause I know it's there  
  
Oh, can you just tell me  
It's all right (It's all right)  
Let me sleep tonight  
Oh, can you comfort me  
Tonight (It's all right)  
Make it all seem fine  
  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
  
There'll be no lullabies  
There'll be no tears cried  
We feel numb 'cause we don't see  
That if we really care  
And we really loved  
Think of all the joy we'd feel  
  
Oh, can you just tell me  
It's all right (It's all right)  
Let me sleep tonight  
Oh, can you comfort me  
Tonight (It's all right)  
Make it all seem fine  
  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
I just can't make it alone  
Oh, no, no  
  
Ain't got no lullaby, no, no  
Ain't got no lullaby, oh, no  
There is no space and time  
Oh lord  
There is no space and time  
Oh lord  
  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
We have existence and it's all we share  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there  
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there
