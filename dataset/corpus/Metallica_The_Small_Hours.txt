(Originally recorded by Holocaust)  
  
Look out at the darkness, and you will see  
Just call my name and I'll be there  
You cannot touch me, you would not dare  
I am the chill that's in the air  
  
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way  
As the barriers crumble, at the end of the day, a-ha  
  
Dark rivers are flowing, back into the past  
You are the fish for which I cast  
And what of the future, what is to be  
As the rivers flow into the sea  
  
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way  
As the barriers crumble, at the end of the day  
  
Do not take for granted, powers out there  
Don't step into the demon's lair  
Time is an illusion, rising from time  
Steep is the mountain which we climb  
  
And I try to get through to you, in my own special way  
As the barriers crumble, at the end of the day
