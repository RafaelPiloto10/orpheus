Once I was young and so unsure  
I'd try any ill to find the cure  
An old man told me  
Tryin' to scold me  
"Oh, son, don't wade to deep in Bitter Creek,"  
(Bitter Creek)  
Out where the desert meets the sky  
Is where I go when I want to hide  
  
Oh, peyote (oh,peyote,mm)  
She tried to show me  
(tried to show me)  
You know there ain't no cause to weep  
at Bitter Creek  
(Bitter Creek)  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
We're gonna hit the road for one last time  
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind  
All that money (All that money,ooh..)  
No more runnin' (No more runnin')  
I can't wait to see the old man's face  
When I win the race  
(Bitter Creek)  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo.........
