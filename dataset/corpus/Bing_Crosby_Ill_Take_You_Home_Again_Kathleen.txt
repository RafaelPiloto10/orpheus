I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen  
Across the ocean wild and wide  
To where your heart has ever been  
Since first you were my Bonnie bride.  
The roses all have left your cheek.  
I've watched them fade away and die  
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak  
And tears bedim your loving eyes.  
  
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!  
  
I know you love me, Kathleen, dear  
Your heart was ever fond and true.  
I always feel when you are near  
That life holds nothing dear, but you.  
The smiles that once you gave to me  
I scarcely ever see them now  
Though many, many times I see  
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.  
  
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!  
  
To that dear home beyond the sea  
My Kathleen shall again return.  
And when thy old friends welcome thee  
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.  
Where laughs the little silver stream  
Beside your mother's humble cot  
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam  
There all your grief will be forgot.  
  
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!
