Well it's a long, long road when you're out there alone,  
No matter what side you're on,  
But there's a heart of gold behind the smile  
And it brought me to where I belong.  
  
Cause I'd set my sights on finding you  
And I'm staying forever, you know it's true  
Yes I'd set my sights on finding you  
Don't be lonely tonight, we can make it alright  
  
No matter what you say,  
No matter who you are,  
Love always finds a way  
Finds a way to your heart.  
  
Well it's a cold lonely road, but you can survive  
No matter which way you choose,  
And as long as there's life behind these eyes  
I'm here with you, win or lose.  
  
If you let your light shine on through  
Someone will come round to pull you through,  
Yes just let your light shine on through,  
Don't be lonely tonight, you can make it alright.  
  
Just hold my hand,  
Come with me a while, I'll make you smile.  
Just hold my hand  
There's someone who loves you, it's me, oh it's me.  
  
No matter what you say,  
No matter who you are,  
Love always finds a way  
Finds a way to your heart.  
  
It's alright that you cry if you're lonely sometime,  
No matter who's by your side,  
Cause the love that you look for is inside us all,  
But it's something you have to find  
  
And I'd set my sights on finding you  
And I'm staying forever, you know it's true.  
Yes I'd set all my sights on finding you  
Don't be lonely tonight, we can make it alright.  
  
No matter what you say,  
No matter who you are,  
Love always finds a way  
Finds a way to your heart.
