My daddy used to tell me  
When I was under his wing  
If you want to live a good life  
Just remember one thing  
Though the world that we live in  
Can be so unkind  
If you love a good woman  
It's all honey and wine  
  
I thought my daddy was wrong  
Girl I was so lonely  
Until you came along  
You began with the holding  
Yeah the kissing was fine  
All that was ready for the tasting  
Was the honey and wine  
  
It's all honey and wine now  
It's all honey and wine  
If you love a good woman  
It's all honey and wine  
  
It's all honey and wine now  
It's all honey and wine  
It's all honey and wine  
  
It's all honey and wine now  
It's all honey and wine  
If you love a good woman it's all honey and wine
