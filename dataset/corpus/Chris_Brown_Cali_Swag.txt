(Chris Brown)  
Yeah my swagger's like Uh in the domino at that  
Swathy sending text and she fellin' me lemme forward that  
To my other girl, now she say she wanna meet her  
A nigga going in like a quarter in a meter  
So come on,  
  
I don't give a damn if she rollin' then I'm rollin'  
I ain't talking 'bout appeal, but she pop it like she own it  
Her continuous moaning, it carries to the morning  
And teach her like a stick, so I'm calling it T-boning  
  
My girl got a girlfriend, so you know what it is  
I call them daycare, 'cause they take care of my kids  
Ah, bring the camera out of motion picture  
Before you take your clothes off, let me get the liquor  
  
Nigga I'm ill, oh believe that  
Her titties like snowballs, call them sky racks  
They be like Hulk Hogan, ain't no one in team  
I tell them, fuck you, nigga it's me  
  
What it is, how you doin' nice to meet you  
My flow is just like bullets  
So this beat will be my nina  
That traver go bow, it split you from your feet up  
  
I got your girl wet, flooding like Katrina  
Rather Billy or Bima, Fatima of Christina  
Milly Yang I'mma done, I'm getting right between her  
I'm strip club ballin' throwing franklins like Aretha  
  
She said her mouth dry, so I'm guessing it's the refull  
Whole team gorillaz, K Mack and Joe  
Cali swag nigga, I ain't talking doggie do  
It's reject nigga, have you breaking all the rules  
  
Your my catdaddy, check on tmz it's breaking news  
My car lot, jackpot, got these girls cheering like a mascot  
Boy you ask that, 'cause I'm hot  
I'm mad, all you singles neck like an ascot  
  
I'm on the top hold your hair tip  
When they hear the fame drop, they gon' shit a brick  
No pun intended, but I recommand it  
Fuck your feelings nigga, I don't care if you offended
