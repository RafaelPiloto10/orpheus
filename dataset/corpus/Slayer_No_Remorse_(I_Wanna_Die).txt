It's the terror that you've gotta miss  
And I wanna see you right in front of death  
Your eyes will shine  
We're all alone and there is no noise  
  
Step into my shadow  
With no remorse  
  
With no remorse you ain't gotta die  
The loudest noise can't make me happy  
Come on, bastards, feels so good  
The record's coming out, baby  
  
With no remorse I want to die  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  
  
"Remain calm, I'm coming to your house to kill you"  
  
I can't come down  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  
  
What you want me to do?  
What you want me to do?  
  
No remorse 'cause I wanna die  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die
