I guess this is what it's supposed to feel like  
No we don't talk, no we don't talk, we don't talk anymore  
I guess this is what it's supposed to sound like  
The universe, the universe, universe is torn  
  
I don't want to live without you  
I can live without you half the day, hey hey  
I don't want to live without you  
And put life off for another day  
Hey-hey yeah hey-hey yeah  
  
But I can't stop  
Thinking about, thinking about us  
Anymore oh oh  
I said I can't stop  
Thinking about, thinking about us  
Anymore oh oh  
I said I can't stop, no  
Thinking about, thinking about this  
Anymore oh oh  
And all I've got, uh  
Is nothing I want  
Anymore oh oh  
  
No I never get used to silence  
But I don't hear, no I don't hear  
I don't hear you anymore  
I know I had to look hard to find it  
Everything, everything, everything is gone  
  
I don't want to live without you  
And put life off for another day  
Hey-hey yeah hey-hey yeah  
  
But I can't stop  
Thinking about, thinking about us  
Anymore oh oh  
I said I can't stop  
Thinking about, thinking about us  
Anymore oh oh  
I said I can't stop, no  
Thinking about, thinking about this  
Anymore oh oh  
And all I've got, uh  
Is nothing I want  
Anymore oh oh  
  
I can see stars, I can see our lives in a self destructing lane  
I can see stars, I can see lights, shining here  
  
But I can't stop  
Thinking about, thinking about us  
Anymore oh oh  
I said I can't stop  
Thinking about, thinking about us  
Anymore oh oh  
I said I can't stop, no  
Thinking about, thinking about this  
Anymore oh oh  
And all I've got, uh  
Is nothing I want  
Anymore oh oh
