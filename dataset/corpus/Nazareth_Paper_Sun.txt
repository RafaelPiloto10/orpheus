Theres a paper sun  
In a paper sky  
Theres an empty place  
And I don't know why  
That paper sun  
In that paper sky  
Can't help me now shes gone  
I'm on my own  
Can't help me now, I'm all alone  
Theres a painted moon  
In a painted night  
Theres an empty plate  
And it don't seem right  
That painted moon  
In that painted night  
Can't help me now shes gone  
I'm on my own  
Can't help me now, I'm all alone  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all  
Theres a falling star  
And it wont touch down  
Theres and empty face  
Another lonely clown  
That falling star that wont touch down  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all.. Ll.. Ll  
Ahhhh
