I'm goin' down Louisiana way  
I was born down Louisiana way  
I'm goin back as of this very day  
Don't worry about me cause I'll be okay  
I was born down Louisiana way  
I'm goin' down Louisiana way  
  
I will miss all my old Chicago friends  
And think about you San Francisco now and then  
I will remember my compadres in L.A.  
Look me up down Louisiana way  
  
I'm goin' down Louisiana way  
I was born down Louisiana way  
I'm goin back as of this very day  
Don't worry about me cause I'll be okay  
I was born down Louisiana way  
I'm goin' down Louisiana way  
  
Don't let your eyes get misty now  
We knew the time would come around for me to go  
I will miss you  
  
So long my friend, guess I'll see you while ago  
I might be back sometime, you just never know  
I have left a sweet heart north of Whiskey Bay  
True love waits down Louisiana way  
  
I'm goin' down Louisiana way  
I was born down Louisiana way  
I'm goin back as of this very day  
Don't worry about me cause I'll be okay  
I was born down Louisiana way  
I'm goin' down Louisiana way
