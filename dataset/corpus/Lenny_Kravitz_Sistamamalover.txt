I've gone from talkin' to walkin'  
You touch me deep down inside  
Oh can't you see that I'm fallin'  
And I can no longer hide  
  
You are my everything  
my sistamamalover  
You give me everything  
I have no need to borrow  
And when I think of you  
You take away my sorrow  
I'll always love you baby  
Like there's no tomorrow  
  
When I get up in the morning  
I feel like I'm so alive  
With you it never gets boring  
'Cause you always get me high  
High  
  
You are my everything  
my sistamamalover  
You give me everything  
I have no need to borrow  
And when I think of you  
You take away my sorrow  
I'll always love you baby  
Like there's no tomorrow  
  
I'll never go with another  
'Cause baby you are so fly  
Don't have to live undercover  
Because I don't have to lie  
I don't have to lie baby  
  
You are my everything  
my sistamamalover  
You give me everything  
I have no need to borrow  
And when I think of you  
You take away my sorrow  
I'll always love you baby  
Like there's no tomorrow
