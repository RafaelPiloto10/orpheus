[Verse 1]  
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent  
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since  
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent  
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant  
Cherish these nights, cherish these people  
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel  
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful  
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool  
Cherish these days, man do they go quick  
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06  
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed  
I look down, "yes I suppose"  
  
[Hook]  
All things go, all things go  
All things go, all things go  
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone  
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls  
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong  
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young  
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go  
We wake back up and do it all again  
We know, we know, say "fuck the world", we ridin' til the end  
I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence  
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him  
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?  
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same  
Even though they know that I love him  
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me  
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me  
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me  
  
[Hook]  
All things go, all things go  
All things go, all things go  
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone  
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls  
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong  
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young  
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go  
We wake back up and do it all again  
We know, we know, say "fuck the world", we ridin' til the end  
I know its sudden, look at what we've become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
[Verse 3]  
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business  
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas  
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me  
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness  
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact  
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that  
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective  
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected  
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"  
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute  
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them  
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him  
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him  
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him  
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint  
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint  
  
[Hook]  
All things go, all things go  
All things go, all things go
