Two young hearts lost in love they vow to stay,  
Running wild they believe they've found a way  
Filled with hope  
She's the dream, she understands you  
Now this time he'll hold on, she'll never leave him  
They'll never let go 'cause...  
  
Once you love somebody, (once you love)  
There's no turning back (turning back)  
It can burn forever, it can haunt you, haunt you in the night  
  
How can lovers just turn and walk away  
Loneliness is an edge that cuts both ways  
So easy to fall  
So hard to get over  
  
Once you love somebody, (once you love)  
There's no turning back (turning back)  
It can burn forever, it can haunt you, haunt you in the night  
So easy to fall, so hard to get over  
Once you love somebody, (once you love)  
There's no turning back (turning back)  
It can burn forever, it can haunt you, haunt you in the night  
  
(Once you love somebody), once you love  
(they can break your heart), no no no  
It can burn forever, letting go, that's the hardest part
