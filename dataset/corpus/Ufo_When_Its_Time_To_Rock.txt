It's hot up in the west end, there's panic right downtown  
As the gangs assemble, coming up from underground  
Well Jesus I don't know which side I should be on  
I'm a class contender if anything goes wrong  
  
When it's time to rock  
We're the only ones  
No one takes this block  
'Cause we're number one  
  
We sneaked through the no go, very late last night  
Out up from the back streets, cruising for a fight  
  
Well Jackie's got his six string, he can play behind his back  
Mickey's out from Bellevue, he's just makin' tracks  
  
When it's time to rock  
We're the only ones  
No one takes this block  
'Cause we're number one  
  
As we rocked through the midnight, took 'em all by storm  
The police boys didn't have a chance, didn't even get warm  
Oh daddy, why am I sittin' here, I'm not a member of the bar  
I'm not the only wild one in a hot wired car  
  
When it's time to rock  
We're the only ones  
No one takes this block  
'Cause we're number one
