Dear heart wish you were here to warm this night  
My dear heart, seems like a year since you've been out of my sight  
A single room, a table for one  
It's a lonesome town all right  
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door  
And dear heart I want you to know  
I'll leave your arms never more  
  
(A single room, a table for one)  
It's a lonesome town all right  
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door  
And dear heart I want you to know  
I'll leave your arms never more
