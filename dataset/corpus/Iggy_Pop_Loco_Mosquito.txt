My mommy told me  
If I were goody  
That she would buy me  
A rubber dolly  
  
I got some energy to burn  
It makes me jumpy and nervous  
But I'm too damn old to join the military service  
Hup two three four  
I got to hit my baby on a Saturday night  
You know the devil made me do it  
I know it wasn't right  
  
Like a loco mosquito  
'Round and 'round and 'round I go  
And when I'm hungry  
Down I go  
  
Please Mr. Custer I don't want to go  
And spend my night in a bar with some stupid dodo  
I'm sick of hanging 'round with old transvestites  
They stare at my rubbers  
It makes me uptight  
  
And here I go  
In love again  
Here I go-oh wo wo  
Like a loco mosquito  
  
I got some energy to burn  
But you always want to tap it  
You're busy sucking on my gas tank  
Before I can tap it  
  
Like a loco mosquito  
'Round and 'round and 'round I go  
And when I'm hungry  
Down I go  
  
Loco Mosquito
