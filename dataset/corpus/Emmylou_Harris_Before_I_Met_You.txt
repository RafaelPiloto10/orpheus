I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time  
But that was before I met you  
I never saw one that I wanted for mine  
But that was before I met you  
  
I thought I was swingin' the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you  
  
Well, I wanted to ramble and always be free  
But that was before I met you  
I said that no woman could ever hold me  
But that was before I met you  
  
I thought I was swingin' the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you  
  
They tell me I must reap just what I have sown  
But darlin', I hope that's not true  
'Coz once I made plans about livin' alone  
That was before I met you  
  
I thought I was swingin' the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
And I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you
