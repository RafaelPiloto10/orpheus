Try talking to you  
While you do, while you do  
I swap places with you  
Just to see things through  
Just sing me the tune  
And you'll see  
I'll keep it here for you  
I'll wait for your cue  
  
You wrote down all the words  
Black and white  
On a wall  
Just keepin' it so  
Yeah you know how it goes  
No plans for a change, nothing strange  
No not today no way  
Now sing me the tune  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
So you twist and you turn  
Uncomfortable fool, you'll never learn  
But you can take a stand  
Forget all about the plans California rose  
  
Side one track two  
On a record of you  
I've even stuck on a groove  
That I don't wanna lose  
Just play it again, as a friend  
It's your favorite worn-in shoes  
Now sing me the tune  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away, yeah  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
So you crash, and you burn  
Sometimes the road will twist and turn  
Some of this, less of that  
Forget all about the map California road  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away, yeah  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway
