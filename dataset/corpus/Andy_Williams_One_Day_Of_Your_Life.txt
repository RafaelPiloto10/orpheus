One day of your life is all I'm askin' girl,  
Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world.  
If you give me one little moment I will make this moment last,  
I'll live the future with the past.  
  
One day of your life can't mean that much to you,  
It's only one day of your life, but it will see me through.  
If I can't have you for ever, if I can't have things my way  
I'll be content with just one day.  
  
If I must build a world of fantasy,  
Please with a memory.  
  
One day of your life is all I'm asking girl,  
Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world.  
If I can't have you for ever, if I can't have things my way  
I'll be content with just one day.  
  
One day of your life,  
Ooooh one day of your life,  
It's only one day of your life,  
Just give me only one day of your life
