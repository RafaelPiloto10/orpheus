What you get and what you see  
Things that don't come easily  
Feeling happy in my vein  
Icicles within my brain  
Cocaine!  
  
Something blowing in my head  
Winter's ice, it soon will spread  
Death would freeze my very soul  
Makes me happy, makes me cold  
Cocaine!  
  
My eyes are blind, but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel there's no place freezing me  
  
Don't you think I know what I'm doing?  
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong  
You're the one who's really a loser  
This is where I feel I belong  
  
Crystal world with winter flowers  
Turns my day to frozen hours  
Lying snowblind in the sun  
Will my ice age ever come?  
  
My eyes are blind, but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel there's no place freezing me...
