Somewhere out there,  
Beneath the pale moon night,  
Someone's thinking of me,  
And loving me tonight.  
Somewhere out there,  
Someone's saying a prayer,  
That we'll find one another,  
In that big somewhere out there.  
And even though I know how very far apart we are,  
It helps to think we might be wishing  
On the same bright star,  
And when the night wind starts to sing  
A lonesome lullaby,  
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the  
Same big sky.  
Somewhere out there,  
If love can see us through,  
Then, we'll be together,  
Somewhere out there, out where dreams, come true.  
And even though I know how very far apart we are,  
It helps to think we might be wishing  
On the same bright star,  
And when the night wind starts to sing  
A lonesome lullaby,  
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the  
Same big sky.  
Somewhere out there,  
If love can see us through, (can see us through)  
Then, we'll be together,  
Somewhere out there, out where dreams, come true.
