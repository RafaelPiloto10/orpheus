[Verse 1]  
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on  
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young  
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made  
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake  
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch  
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough  
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea  
There was something in the water, now that something's in me  
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
  
[Verse 2]  
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late  
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face  
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance  
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance  
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
It's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
  
[Outro]  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
