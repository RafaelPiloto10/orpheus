The further you get, the better you see  
Ooh yeah, it all goes on and on, infinitely  
The closer you are, the better you see  
Oh, within, within, there is infinity  
Worlds within worlds within worlds within worlds  
  
Let your soul take you higher  
There are no bounds  
Let your soul take you higher  
(chase your fire)  
(out of love, with empty souls)  
  
Oh look back from the stars and see we are dust  
It all goes on and on and we are the dust  
So why don't we laugh, and why-  
Why don't we sing...  
In endless chords and harmonies  
We're angels, dancing 'round  
  
Let your soul take you higher  
There are no bounds  
Let your soul take you higher  
(chase your fire)  
(out of love, with empty souls)
