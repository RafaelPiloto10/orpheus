No matter how long it takes  
No mater how long  
No matter how long it takes  
Well never be alone  
Don't wanna make a wrong headline  
No matter how strong  
They'll be watching every move you make  
Don't let em know they can beat you  
  
Fortune favor the brave  
Learn how to use that muscle  
Take a little chance will get you  
Everything you see  
Living at the speed of light  
Gotta make your heart beat faster  
You gotta climb inside  
Set that spirit free  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
Stumble on the ground that shakes you  
Push it to the point that breaks you  
Little bit of fire it gives you  
Soul of a winner  
Help you bring them to their knees  
  
In the face of the foe  
Never let em drag you under  
Don't you wanna leave behind ya  
A legacy  
Catch another streak of lightning  
By the God of fire and thunder  
Battle in the name of the nation  
Making history  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
And brother when you're down to zero  
Everybody needs that hero  
Gotta be a star to follow  
All the way there  
And all the way home
