See the writings on the wall  
If you can read  
There's a black list  
Got one name and it's me  
Yea I got no invitation  
But I won't leave  
Gonna keep on fighting  
For everything that's me  
  
It's my life  
I'm living free  
Ain't nobody nowhere  
Got no chains on me

There's a black list  
Got one name and it's me  
Yea I got no invitation  
But I won't leave  
Gonna keep on fighting  
For everything that's me  
  
If you don't like me - tough, you better leave  
Keep on fighting for the things I believe
