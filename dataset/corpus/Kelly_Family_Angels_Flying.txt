I Can't Hold My Tears Now  
I Can't Hold Them Back  
Maybe She'll Come Back  
Come Back To Me  
  
Those Beautiful Eyes  
Those Beautiful Smiles  
They're Like Sugar And Honey  
I Was Wrong She Was Right  
You Are An Angel  
You Are An Angel  
  
Chorus:  
If You See, Angels Flying  
Wave Goodbye  
If You See, Angels Flying  
Wave Goodbye  
  
Can't Hold My Tears Back  
We're Too Far Apart  
Maybe She'll Come Back  
Come Back To Me  
  
Those Beautiful Eyes  
Those Beautiful Smiles  
They're Like Sugar And Honey  
I Was Lost Now I'm Found  
Please Forgive Me  
You Are An Angel  
  
Chorus 5x  
  
Those Beautiful Eyes  
Those Beautiful Smiles  
They're Like Sugar And Honey  
I Was Wrong She Was Right  
You Are An Angel
