Hello there sir.  
Well I'll tell ya, I've lived around here all my life  
And I never once noticed this place.  
You need a sign out there or somethin buddy,  
Probably bring some business to the joint.  
Yes, how may I help you today?  
I'm lookin for some kind of uh...  
Some kind of clock or somethin, somethin for the old man.  
He collects old shit like this and I figured,  
I figured I'd get 'em somethin before he dies and rots on me ya know?  
Ah, well perhaps you can use a gift yourself?  
Well, I'm not much for old shit like this myself.  
But I insist, I have somethin just right for you.  
This will help you find more then you are looking for.  
A candle huh? Yeah well maybe I'm in the wrong place.  
Consider it a gift from your neighbor.  
But I heh.... Have electricity in my house.  
No, this is no ordinary candle by boy.  
Come closer and witness the light  
That this magical candle will shed upon your life.  
Listen uh, I really gotta get goin.  
Witness my friend, witness the light, of the Amazing Jeckel Brothers!
