May Day  
Cut down to size again  
What then  
When less is more my friend  
I'll change  
Let me start again  
Disguise  
It's too weird to explain  
  
Why I'll  
Always call your name  
Adieu, with you  
I could be anything  
That I want to be  
Whirlwind  
Wildfire and driving rain  
Wheels spin  
Bowl me over hurricane  
Whirlwind  
Crack your cheeks and blow  
  
Me Far  
So far  
How far  
Is Shangri-la from here  
And is it this way?  
There she blows  
Tear me down tornado  
Whirlpool  
Drag me to the deeps below  
Whirlwind  
Will a wildcat strike be tame?  
  
Earthquake  
Shake me to my feet again  
It's crosswords go you near  
A fatal clue I fear  
This case is closed  
Elementally, my dear.  
Beware  
Whirlwind
