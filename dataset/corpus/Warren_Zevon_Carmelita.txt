I hear Mariachi static on my radio  
And the tubes they glow in the dark  
And I'm there with her in Ensenada  
And I'm here in Echo Park  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Well, I'm sittin' here playing solitaire  
With my pearl-handled deck  
The county won't give me no more methadone  
And they cut off your welfare check  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Well, I pawned my Smith Corona  
And I went to meet my man  
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street  
By the Pioneer chicken stand  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Carmelita hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin
