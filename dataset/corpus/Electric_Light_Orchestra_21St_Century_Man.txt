A penny in your pocket  
Suitcase in your hand  
They won't get you very far  
Now you're a 21st century man.  
  
Fly across the city  
Rise above the land  
You can do 'most anything  
Now you're a 21st century man.  
  
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow  
You still wander the fields of your sorrow  
  
One day you're a hero  
Next day you're a clown  
There's nothing that is in between  
Now you're a 21st century man.  
  
You should be so happy  
You should be so glad  
So why are you so lonely  
You 21st century man  
  
You stepped out of a dream believing  
Everything was gone  
Return with what you've learned  
They'll kiss the ground you walk upon.  
  
Things ain't how you thought they were  
Nothing have you planned  
So pick up your penny and your suitcase  
You're not a 21st century man.  
  
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow  
You still wander the fields of your sorrow  
21st century man
