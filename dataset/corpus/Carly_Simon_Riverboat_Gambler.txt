Riverboat gambler  
Drinking alone on the prow  
Chasing your Bourbon with Tennessee gin  
The big game's about to begin  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Hiding that Ave up your sleeve  
I can see through all that debonaire style  
The irony bending your smile  
  
And I won't tip your hand  
I won't do you in  
I want to stay near you  
I want you to win  
  
Riverboat gambler  
You can defy all the odds  
You can draw diamonds to fill out your flush  
You can find someone to trust  
  
And I won't steal your chips  
I won't steal your pride  
Won't you take me on faith  
Won't you let me inside  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Under our velvet and lace  
You're an old vagabond, I'm a poor waif  
Let's make a place that's safe  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Come on and let me inside
