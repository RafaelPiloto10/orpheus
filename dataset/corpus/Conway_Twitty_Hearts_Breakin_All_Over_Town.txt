Hush, hush  
Everyone who had a great big crush  
Just hit the ground  
Yeah, that's the sound  
Of hearts breakin' all over town  
  
Hey, hey, guys, I see you've heard the news  
Sooner or later she had to choose  
Yeah, we all thought we might be the one  
Now, she's gone and tied the knot  
And everybody looks so stunned  
  
Hush, hush  
Everyone who had a great big crush  
Just hit the ground  
Yeah, that's the sound  
Of hearts breakin' all over town  
  
She had looks and such a charming way  
You know, girls like her don't come along every day  
She cast a spell you could not resist  
Now, all of us are moping around  
Crying 'bout the chance we missed  
  
Hush, hush  
Everyone who had a great big crush  
Just hit the ground  
Yeah, that's the sound  
Of hearts breakin' all over town  
  
Hush, hush [unverified]
