Found your picture in an old coat  
And the ghost stirred deep inside.  
All this time and I still feel the cold  
From the madness in my pride.  
Don't know why you ended it that way  
I would've thought that you would tell  
Me to my face  
CHORUS  
Color me blue on blu  
Color me sadness without you.  
Color me blue on blue  
And I will wear it well.  
I will wear it well.  
Painted someone from a vision.  
You saw the future in his eyes.  
I know that wasn't how you pictured me.  
You stole my hope, now I'll never know why.  
Two hearts who began to beat as one.  
I guess you scared yourself  
And now you're on the run.
