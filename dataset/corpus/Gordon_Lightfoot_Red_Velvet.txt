Four months ago in April on a daycoach she came down  
And the dust autumn winds begin to blow  
Shoulda known I couldn't hold livin' out so far from town  
And the nights to come are long are slow to go  
Well now she's up and left me and when walkin' down the line  
And the dusty autumn wind begins to blow  
All dressed up in red velvet and he high heeled shoes so fine  
And the nights to come are long and slow to go  
Well if I had only know before we kissed  
You can't keep red velvet on a poor dirt farm like this  
Oh now she's gone and left me and went walkin' down the line  
And the dusty autumn winds begin to blow  
Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around  
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow  
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town  
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go  
Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around  
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow  
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town  
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go  
And those dusty autumn winds begin to blow
