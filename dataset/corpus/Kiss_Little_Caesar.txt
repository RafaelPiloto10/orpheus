Ten million stories in the city  
Ten million backs against the wall  
Desperation's out tonight  
You can cut it with a knife  
Everybody wants to have it all  
Well they tell you that the world is rough  
But they never rocked it hard enough  
  
Hey, little Caesar  
Nobody messing with you  
Hey, little Caesar  
Go show 'em what you can do  
  
Nobody said that it was pretty, no no  
You haven't got a penny or a prayer  
You know it's gonna be a fight  
If you want to see your name in lights  
Ain't nobody gives a damn out there  
Well you got your guts and you got your pride  
You'll never let them see inside  
  
Hey, little Caesar  
Nobody messing with you  
Hey, little Caesar  
Go show 'em what you can do  
Let them show 'em what you can do  
  
Well you don't believe in the books and rules  
Cause you just believe what you know is cool  
Well they try to tell you that the world is rough  
But they never rocked it hard enough  
I can't hear you, oh yeah!  
  
Well, they just don't understand  
You gotta fight to be a man  
  
Hey, little Caesar  
Nobody messing with you  
Hey, little Caesar  
Go show 'em what you can do  
  
Hey, little Caesar  
Oh yeah, that's what it is  
Hey, little Caesar  
Yeah, come on, oh yeah  
Hey, little Caesar  
Now show 'em, yeah
