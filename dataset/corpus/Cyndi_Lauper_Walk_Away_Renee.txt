The lyrics as they performed it  
When I see the sign that points "one way".  
The lot we used to pass by every day.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
And as the rain beats down,  
Upon my weary eyes.  
For me it cries.  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart, upon the wall,  
Still find a way to haunt me,  
Though they're so small.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
These empty sidewalks on my block  
Are not the same.  
You're not to blame.
