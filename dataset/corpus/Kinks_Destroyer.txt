Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place  
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere  
Stop! hold on. stay in control  
  
Girl, I want, you here with me  
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be  
Cause there's a red, under my bed  
And there's a little yellow man in my head  
And there's a true, blue, inside of me  
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya  
  
Paranoia, need destroyer. Paranoia, they destroy ya'  
  
Well I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda' queer  
Lola looked at me and said ooh you look so weird  
She said man, there's really something wrong with you  
One day you're gonna' self-destruct  
You're up, get down, I'll come work you out  
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out  
  
Silly boy ya' self-destroyer. Silly boy ya' self-destroyer  
  
Silly boy you got so much to live for  
So much to aim for, so much to try for  
You blow it all with, paranoia  
You're so insecure you, self-destroyer  
  
(and it goes like this, here it goes) paranoia, they destroy ya  
(here it goes again) paranoia, they destroy ya  
  
Dr. Dr. help her please I know you'll understand  
There's a time device inside of me I'm a self-destructin' man  
There's a red, under my bed  
And there's a little green man in my head  
And said you're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad  
Cause there's a man in ya, knawin' ya, tearin' ya, in to to  
  
Silly boy ya' self-destroyer. paranoia, they destroy ya'  
  
Self-destroyer, wreck your health  
Destroy friends, destroy yourself  
The time device of, self-destruction  
Lies, confusion, start eruption  
  
(yea, it goes like this, here it goes) paranoia, they destroy ya  
(here's to paranoia) paranoia, they destroy ya  
(hey hey, here it goes) paranoia, they destroy ya  
(and it goes like this)  
  
Paranoia, they destroy ya (and it goes like this)
