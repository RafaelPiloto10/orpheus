Tonight down here in the valley I'm lonesome and oh how I feel  
As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill  
Do you recall when we parted the story to me you revealed  
You said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill  
(The light shines bright from your window the trees stand so silent and still)  
I know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
