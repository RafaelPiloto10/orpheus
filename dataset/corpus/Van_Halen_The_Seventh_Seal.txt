Walk me down to the wishing well  
Help me find that miracle  
Splash that holy water on me  
Drown my faith in trinity, yeah!  
Oh yeah  
Little by little, gonna get it, I swear  
One more piece of the puzzle, I'm there  
Gotta get lucky, gotta get that done  
Little bit of luck never hurt no one  
Come on take me down, down,  
Down...  
I'm in a cold sweat  
Lord don't let me drown, drown,  
Drown, drown  
In mother earth's soul, yet  
Under darken skies  
We'll see the light  
Broken now I can't help but feel  
Someone cracked the seventh seal  
Nothing sacred, nothing left  
Unturned  
When nothing's simple  
Then nothing's learned  
So take me down to the virgin spring  
Wash away my suffering, oh  
Splash that holy water on me  
Wash my eyes so I can see  
Come on take me down, down, down...  
I'm in a cold sweat  
Yeah, don't let me drown, drown,  
Drown, drown  
In mother earth's soul, not yet  
Lord I think I found, found, found...  
My mother lode, hey  
Down, down, down, down, down,  
Down  
Take me down, down, down, down...  
Take me
