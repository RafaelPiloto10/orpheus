Sometimes it's easy  
It's meant to be  
I dream of the moment  
You'll be with me  
  
'Cause I wanna look down now  
I wanna get deeper  
Can you let me in?  
To show me places  
To be my keeper  
I'm waiting for my Seraphim  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
Yeah, I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
  
My heart is ready  
My mind is open  
My body's aching  
I wait for you  
  
'Cause I wanna rise up now  
Don't wanna be earthbound  
Reach up to the sky  
Into the distance  
And the future  
It's waiting for me in your eyes  
  
Looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
Yeah, I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
(I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when good things are good  
I want to share them  
I don't want to be alone  
And when darkness falls  
Will you hear my call  
And show me the way back home?  
  
'Cause I want this life  
To be twice as nice  
With somebody by my side  
So I dream of things  
Like your golden wings  
When you carry me and fly  
  
'Cause I wanna look down now  
I wanna get deeper  
Can you let me in?  
To show me places  
To be my keeper  
I'm waiting for my Seraphim  
  
I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
Yeah, I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
  
Oh, I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
(I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you)  
Yeah, I'm looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
(I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you)  
  
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
