Busted flat, it baton rouge, headin' for the trains  
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained  
Took us all the way to New Orleans  
  
I took my harpoon out of my old dirty red bandanna  
I was playin' sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With those windshield wipers slappin' time  
And Bobby's clappin' hands we finally  
Sang up every song that driver knew  
  
Oh, oh, oh, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free  
Oh, oh, oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
I'm feeling good was good enough for me, Bobby Mcgee  
  
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I'd done  
And every night she kept me from the cold  
  
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away  
Looking for that home and I hope she'll find  
I'll trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin' bobby's body next to mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' left was all she left for me  
Oh, oh, oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord when Bobby sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me and by Mcgee  
  
Oh, oh, oh, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free  
Oh, oh, oh, feelin' good was easy, Lord
