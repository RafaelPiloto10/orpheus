In these last few days, you've been on my mind  
An' we should get together an' talk about old times  
An' put the past behind us before life slips away  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you in these last few days  
In these last few days, I have felt my age  
I wish that I was younger but time has turned the page  
I sure miss the water and the rhythm of the waves  
I've been feelin' fragile in these last few days  
But I have been a father, a husband and a son  
Lookin' back is bitter sweet, now that my race has run  
I've tried to be a witness from the cradle to the grave  
Time has felt so precious in these last few days  
In these last few days, I've seen the light  
And I'll be waitin' for you on the other side  
My old friend, I love you, that's really all there's left to say  
Lay down here beside me in these last few days  
My old friend, I'll miss you but I'm trying to be brave  
Lay down here beside me in these last few days
