Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again  
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me  
You know she won't understand  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
  
Hey barroom mirror on the wall  
Go stare at someone else  
Don't show the world the fool I am  
Just keep it to yourself  
  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again  
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me  
You know she won't understand  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
  
Dance floor seems you're underneath my feet  
Everywhere I turn  
I oughta waltz right out of them swingin' doors  
But that's a step I just can't learn  
  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
Hey jukebox don't start playin' that song again  
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me  
You know she won't understand  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand
