You can do what you want just seize the day  
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way  
Don't you ever consider giving up  
You will find, oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  
I just want to be here beside you  
And stay until the break of dawn  
  
Take a walk in the park when you feel down  
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up  
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child  
Such a dream, oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to be here beside you  
And stay until the break of dawn  
  
You're looking for somewhere to belong  
You're standing all alone  
For someone to guide you on your way  
Now and forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to be anybody  
  
We're living in different ways  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you to a place  
I've never been before oh yeah  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away  
With you tonight  
  
[Chorus]
