Raging waves sweep this heavy heart.  
Cold is the colour of the dark.  
Find a byway and climb that hill,  
Watch the thunder cast a spell.  
What did you gain from love?  
Don't ask me!  
All for the sweetest thrill...  
  
I see a view from a hill - oh oh.  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill  
Oh oh, view from a hill, and it's only a moment away.  
  
Love is a rainfall, hard on the head,  
No escape though you're soaking wet.  
Leave me blinded by your light.  
Leave me stranded alone tonight.  
What did you gain from love?  
Don't ask me!  
All for the cheapest thrill...  
  
I see a view from a hill -- oh oh.  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill -- oh oh,  
View from a hill, and it's only a motion away.
