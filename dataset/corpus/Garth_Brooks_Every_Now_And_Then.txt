I walked down to the park last night  
Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight  
And my mind started drifting to way back when  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
  
The other day I saw a car like you used to drive  
I got a funny feeling down deep inside  
And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
  
[Chorus]  
I love my life and I've never trade  
Between what you and me had and the life I've made  
She's here and she's real, but you were too  
and every once in a while I think about you  
  
I heard a song on the radio just yesterday  
The same one you always asked me to play  
And when the song was over  
I wished they played it again  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been layin' here all night listenin' to the rain  
Talkin' to my heart and trying to explain  
Why sometimes I catch myself  
Wondering what might have been  
Yes I do think about you every now and then  
Every now and then  
Every now and then
