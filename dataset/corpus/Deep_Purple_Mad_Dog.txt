Don't look too long in my face  
It could be a big mistake  
I'm hanging on a thread so fine  
I need a little space  
I shouldn't say, but I know I must  
I've had enough of pain  
I'm pissed off standing in the rain  
  
It makes me feel like  
A mad dog  
I got nothing to lose  
Mad dog  
You got nothing I can use  
Mad dog  
Howling at the moon  
A mad dog  
  
I need no friends  
I'm on the edge  
Of a broken dream  
Laughing at the pain  
But it makes me want to scream  
I should've known  
She'd be no good  
She tore my heart in two  
But I don't need to talk to you  
  
You make me feel like  
A mad dog  
I got nothing to lose  
Mad dog  
You got nothing I can use  
Mad dog  
Howling at the moon  
A mad dog  
  
She said a hard man is good to find  
And then she raised a doubt  
All that I could give she took  
And then she threw me out  
Well I don't care  
I don't care anymore  
I'm going to lose my grip  
I'm going to let it rip  
  
You make me feel like  
A mad dog  
I got nothing to lose  
Mad dog  
You got nothing I can use  
Mad dog  
Howling at the moon  
A mad dog
