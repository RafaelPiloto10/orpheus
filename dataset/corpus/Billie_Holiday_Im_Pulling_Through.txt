I'm pulling through and it's because of you!  
When I was stranded came your helping hand  
Lonely, hurt I had not known which way to turn  
'Til you said, "Try smiles, not tears, just laugh and learn"  
  
I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!  
You made me see how lovely life could be  
Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost  
To find I'd gained, not lost!  
  
When I thought that hope was really gone  
You showed me I was wrong  
And you taught me how to carry on  
Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song!  
  
I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!  
I'd do the same for you if your turn came  
Hope it never will  
For I've been though the mill  
I won't get this debt  
I'm pulling trough
