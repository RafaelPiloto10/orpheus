Baby I feel guilty, there's no reason why  
Oh baby cause I promised you, love will never lie  
Oh I send a wish to heaven  
I can't stand the pain inside  
This moment tells a story  
And I'm stronger than my pride  
  
It was the night, when the sky rained fire  
(when the sky rained fire)  
It was the night, when the stars begin to fall  
It was the night, when I lost my hearts desire  
It was the night, baby-when I missed your call  
  
Music is the answer-baby, if you cry  
Can't you tell me, where love goes, when it dies  
And I knew it's all or nothing  
It was not a love affair  
Lay your cards here on the table  
If you need me I'll be there
