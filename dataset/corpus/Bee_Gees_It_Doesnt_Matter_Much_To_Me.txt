Hello angel , do you know me ,I'm you man  
Would that be hard for you to try and understand  
I've been waiting for this day for so so long  
Could lovin' you be so so wrong  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
Baby , I been hurt before  
Don't you ask me why I'm here  
Back and knockin' at your door  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember all the nights  
And all the love we went through  
Well you know maybe I thought you had some left over  
Could I mean that much to you  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
Baby, I been hurt before  
Don't you ask me why I'm here  
Back and knockin' at your door  
  
Now open up your arms and take me  
Make me love you till I die  
You wouldn't have me when I was a young man  
But tonight I'm gonna try  
  
It doesn't matter much to me  
Baby , I been hurt before  
Don't you ask me why I'm here  
Back and knockin' at your door
