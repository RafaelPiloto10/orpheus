You could have gotten to know  
In the tinted snow  
And let the coast emotions  
That I haven't seen in some months  
  
The hidden spirit  
Will make the mount to ghost town  
Slow down! To the planet scope  
And if you promised to turn up  
  
You're just not here anymore  
And let the spectators abolish  
Until the buildings form beyond  
You only need us to be us  
  
And make the best of downtown  
Till we run town  
Let the planet scope  
Let the records score
