Your smiling cannot fool me no more  
Your sweet talking cannot fool me no more  
'Cause I know about your cheating  
'Cause I know about you back biting  
And I don't know what you know  
And I have never been where you've been  
And I certainly don't believe in what you believe in  
And I don't do what you do  
I'm a living witness, now I know that  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been  
And I don't know what you know  
And I have never been where you've been  
And I certainly don't believe in what you believe in  
And I don't do what you do  
I'm a living witness, now I know that  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been  
Not every black man is my brother  
Not every white man is my enemy  
I've got no place in your world  
And I've never been where you've been
