Oh my Lord, Please don't forsake me  
This is your child, I'm tired and sore  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need your love, my soul is poor  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord, I can't remember  
When I first said, "Come in my life,"  
For I have lived my life in darkness,  
My whole world is filled with strife  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest.
