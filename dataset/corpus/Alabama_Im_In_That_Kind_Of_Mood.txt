There's something sexy 'bout the way you're dressed  
I can see you're lookin' your best tonight, that's right  
You're walkin' with a new attitude  
There's something different 'bout the way you're movin' tonight, that's right  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
It's been a while since we've been out  
It's overdue baby ain't no doubt you know, ain't it so  
It's feelin' like our first date  
To tell the truth now honey I can't wait to go  
And I think you know  
Well tonight it's just us two and baby I want you  
  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
I'm in that kind of mood  
I'm in that kind of mood  
I'm in that kind of mood
