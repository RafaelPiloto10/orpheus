Gone is the romance that was so divine.  
'tis broken and cannot be mended.  
You must go your way,  
And I must go mine.  
But now that our love dreams have ended...  
What'll I do  
When you are far away  
And I am blue  
What'll I do?  
What'll I do?  
When I am wond'ring who  
Is kissing you  
What'll I do?  
What'll I do with just a photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just a photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true  
What'll I do?
