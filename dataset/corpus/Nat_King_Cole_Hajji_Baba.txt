(Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji)  
Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
He was always in love, in love, in love  
  
Come to my tent, oh my beloved  
Bring me your lips, warm as the sun  
Hear my lament, oh my beloved  
Come to my arms, oh wonderful one  
  
Enter my heart and stay there forever  
Lost in the spell of stars up above  
And we'll be like the man Hajji Baba  
Always in love, always in love  
  
(Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji)  
Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
He was always in love, in love  
  
Deep in each soul, carefully hidden  
There's a desire to be indiscreet  
Hajji has said when love is forbidden  
Love is so sweet, love is so sweet  
  
Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
He was always in love, in love, in love  
  
Come to my arms, oh my beloved
