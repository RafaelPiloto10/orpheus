No, the cabs here, they can't run down to your house  
Sometimes I'll sit and wish I were somewhere else  
So let's dim the daylights for us sweethearts that we are  
Sometimes I find myself still lying in your arms  
All the sweethearts of the world  
Are out dancing in the places  
Where me and all my friends go to hide our faces  
Avenues run one way  
Streets they run the same  
Something in the air here  
Still keeps me away  
Though the cabs here, they can't take me to your house  
I get directions and pretend I was somewhere else  
All the sweethearts of the world are out littering the bars  
And I am still avenues from any place you are  
You know avenues run one way  
The streets they run the same  
It's going to take a lot of shit for me  
To not stay away
