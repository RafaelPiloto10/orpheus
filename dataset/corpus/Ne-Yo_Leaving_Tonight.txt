I believe that love and trust are one in the same  
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them  
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt  
No matter what this person sayin', that person  
You believe your man  
Now you say you love me  
But every time one of your little friends come at you with something  
We gotta do this  
Mama, I'm tryin, I'm trying to show you that I'm for real  
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you  
  
Just shut up and listen  
  
Two hundred and sixteen  
That's how many times that I went  
Back and forth about it in my mind  
Could she, could she really be  
Who he's telling me that she is?  
There's something about it  
That don't feel right  
  
Said, today she called here twenty-six times  
(I know you counted)  
You kept telling me not to worry  
(Don't worry 'bout it)  
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth  
(So don't doubt it)  
But if you are lying to me...  
  
You're leaving tonight  
Out of my life  
Everyone said you ain't no good  
Then you prove them right  
You're leaving tonight  
It's over and done  
Ain't no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes  
(You're leaving tonight)  
  
Baby, now hold up  
Let's just settle down  
'Cause there's a perfect explanation to this situation  
That we're goin' through  
(This thing that we're goin' through)  
I swear I don't know that girl  
But I seen her 'round  
And she's expressed how much she want it  
But, baby, I'm not on that  
All of me is around you, oh  
  
Said, I got a girl like a thousand times  
(So you counted)  
She kept telling me not to worry  
(Don't worry 'bout it)  
Please believe I'm telling the truth  
(I really doubt it)  
Really wish you would believe in me  
  
I'm not leaving tonight  
Girl, you're my life  
All of your friends think I'm no good  
Please, don't prove them right  
I'm not leaving tonight  
It's over and done  
Let's leave this alone, and let's make love  
Till the morning come  
(Not leaving tonight)  
  
Oh, I won't deny  
That everything in my body  
Wants to know that you're the one  
(So, what's the problem, girl?)  
See, I can't take this serious when you're just having fun  
(No, I'm not just having fun)  
Steady running around, making a fool of me, oh!  
(Baby girl, you can't listen to everyone)  
(I'm your man) You're my man (Trust in me)  
(Don't let them interfere with us being happy)  
  
(Love me, girl)  
I love you, that's a fact  
(Say that you love me, baby)  
But I'll be dammed if I'm a let you up and disrespect who's been there from
the start  
You not gon' disrespect my heart  
You claim to not know not know that, girl  
But her name and number is in your phone  
She even got a ring tone  
You care to explain that part?  
  
Said, today she called here twenty-six times  
(I know you counted)  
You kept telling me not to worry  
(Please, don't worry 'bout it)  
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth  
(So don't doubt it)  
But if you are lying to me...  
  
I'm not leaving tonight (leaving tonight)  
Girl, you're my life  
(Everyone said you ain't no good  
And you prove them right, you're leaving tonight)  
I'm not leaving tonight  
(It's over and done)  
Just leave this alone  
And let's make love  
Till the morning come  
Not leaving tonight  
  
Said I just need you to trust me, baby  
(I wanna trust you)  
Not leaving tonight
