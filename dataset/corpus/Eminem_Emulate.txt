[Talking: Obie Trice]  
New shit Obie Trice, Eminem  
Get familiar wit it  
  
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homie's verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed, became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin' and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
That's why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin' the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and ain't spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
[Verse 2: Eminem]  
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin' its a fuckin' mimick when it ain't  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus (Uranus)  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein' crazed  
You don't think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin' you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs  
  
[Talking: Eminem]  
This is Shade 45  
You know how motherfuckin' serious this shit is?  
This shit is so motherfuckin' serious
