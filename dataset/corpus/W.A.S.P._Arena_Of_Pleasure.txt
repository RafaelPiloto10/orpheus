I don't know where I'm going,  
But I can't wait to get there,  
All I know is, I'm just going  
  
I ran away from home last night, gone forever  
I was running for my life  
And I've heard the words of what I should be  
Live, work, die, I am the orphan of the night  
  
Take me down, I'm coming home, the road to ruins  
Inside the pleasure dome  
Take me down, I'm coming home, arena of pleasures  
Where I belong  
  
I'm in the eye of my rage,  
Where no hurricane dies  
  
I'm in the eye of my rage,  
Where the hurricane lies  
Oh, a storm's in my eyes  
And like the beast that's in my soul,  
I'm the restless child  
Ah mama, I'm running for my life  
  
I was sixteen going nowhere,  
Will I see seventeen alive  
And I was running from the nightmare  
I stand at the promised land with fire in my eyes  
I'm at the crossroad of my destiny and desire  
Oh, God, what will I be  
And my obsession is the gasoline to feed my fire  
Oh it's burning in me  
  
Don't waste the tears on my wasted years  
Mama I'm outta here
