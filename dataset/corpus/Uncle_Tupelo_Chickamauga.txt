You'd never leave on your own  
Where you're from and where you're going  
I know these things like I know you hate me now  
Catch yourself in mid-air thinking  
  
Your dreams can never be bought  
I couldn't help you then and I guess I can't help you now  
When jousting is for pleasure  
Pleasure is way out of hand  
  
The time is right for getting out while we still can  
Chickamauga's where I've been  
Solitude is where I'm bound  
I don't ever want to taste these tears again  
  
I don't ever want to taste these tears again  
Appalachian, so patient  
The lessons we've traveled  
As soon as we're out we're kicking our way back in  
  
Fighting fire with unlit matches  
From our respective trenches  
No authority can clean up this mess we're in  
A miracle might point the way  
  
To solutions we're after  
And avert our chronic impending disaster  
Chickamauga's where I've been  
Solitude is where I'm bound  
  
I don't ever want to taste these tears again
