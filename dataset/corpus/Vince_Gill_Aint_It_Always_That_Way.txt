I took chance, I took a fall  
Waited on love 'til I could give it my all  
Then I let my heart fly  
  
Took a rose to her door  
Stood there like a statue just sort of frozen by her presence  
But I shied  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want to believe  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want and you need  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want to rely  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want and you need and you cry  
  
Yes and then I took a space out of time  
I don't wanna sound like a thief but the moment was mine  
And I stole it, it felt right  
  
I took a chance, took a fall  
Waited on love until I could give it my all  
Then I let my heart fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want to believe  
Ain't it always that way  
When you want and you need and you cry
