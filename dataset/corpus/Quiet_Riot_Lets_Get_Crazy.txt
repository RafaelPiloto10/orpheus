Oh yeah!!!  
  
Lookin' for some action, want a mean machine  
Gettin' hot 'n' nasty, climbin' in-between  
  
I'm-a rockin' in the mornin' and in the night  
I'm gonna find a mama makes me feel right  
  
Get down  
Let's get crazy  
Right now  
Let's get crazy (alright)  
  
Wanna kiss your lips, not the ones on your face  
Your innocent jive is really out of place (yeah)  
In need of assistance  
A dog for my bone  
Ain't no way tonight I go home alone  
  
Get down  
Let's get crazy  
Right now  
Let's get crazy (hahahahahahaha)  
  
Oh rock on!  
Oh!!!  
  
Get crazy  
  
Intoxication runnin' through my veins  
A shot of the past keep runnin' in my brain wave  
  
I'm rockin' in the mornin' and in the night  
I'm gonna find a rocker makes me feel right  
  
Get down  
Let's get crazy  
Right now  
Let's get crazy (ah come on get down to business)  
  
Get down (ha)  
Let's get crazy  
Right now  
Let's get crazy (crazy)  
Oh right now  
  
Get down (oh come on)  
We're gonna get crazy (we're gonna rock on tonight)  
Right now (ooh yeah)  
Let's get crazy (hoohoohoohoohoo)  
  
Get down (well well well well well well)  
Let's get crazy (get insane)  
Right now (oh sometime tonight)  
Let's get crazy (CRAZY!)  
  
Get down
