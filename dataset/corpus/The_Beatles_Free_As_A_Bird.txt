Free as a bird  
It's the next best thing to be  
Free as a bird  
  
La, la, la, la  
Home and dry  
Like a homin' bird I fly  
As a bird on wings  
  
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew  
Can we really live without each other?  
Where did we lose the touch  
That seemed to mean so much  
It's always made me feel so  
  
Free as a bird  
It's the next best thing to be  
Free as a bird  
  
La, la, la, la  
Home and dry  
Like a homin' bird I fly  
As a bird on wings  
  
Whatever happened to  
The life that we once knew?  
Always made me feel so free  
  
Free as a bird  
It's the next best thing to be  
Free as a bird  
  
Free as a bird  
Free as a bird  
Free as a bird, oh, oh, oh
