Nice girls not one with a defect, cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct.  
Red dogs under illegal legs, she looks so good that he gets down and begs.  
  
She is watching the detectives, "oh, he's so cute!"  
She is watching the detectives, when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.  
They beat him up until the teardrops start,  
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.  
  
Long shot of that jumping sign, visible shivers running down my spine.  
Cut the baby taking off her clothes.  
Close-up of the sign that says,"We never close"  
You snatch a tune, you a match a cigarette,  
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet.  
I don't know how much more of this I can take.  
She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake.  
  
She is watching the detectives  
  
You think you're alone until you realize you're in it.  
Now fear is here to stay. Love is here for a visit.  
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit.  
Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder who is it?  
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents  
Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.  
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay,  
It only took my little fingers to blow you away.  
  
Just like watching the detectives, don't get cute!"  
It's just like watching the detectives.  
I get so angry when the teardrops start,  
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.  
Just like watching the detectives
