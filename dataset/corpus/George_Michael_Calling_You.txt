A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Someplace better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me?  
I am calling you  
(2x)  
  
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Someplace better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and I can't sleep  
Bu we both know a chage is coming  
Come in closer, sweet release  
  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me?  
I am calling you  
  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere
