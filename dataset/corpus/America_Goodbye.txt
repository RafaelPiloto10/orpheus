Goodbye, Mrs. Sorrow  
Hope you're feeling better tomorrow night  
Don't put up a fight  
It'll do you no good  
Hello, Uncle Freedom  
I've seen them down on their knees for you  
Nothing they wouldn't do  
To have you along  
I got too many problems  
They just don't understand  
They think their every wish  
Is my command  
Oh no, Sister Susie  
You're in a win or lose affair  
Wish I could be there  
To help you along  
Oh yes, Brother Michael  
We all have every faith in you  
And everything you do  
All the way round  
I got too many problems  
They just don't understand  
They think their every wish  
Is my command  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye
