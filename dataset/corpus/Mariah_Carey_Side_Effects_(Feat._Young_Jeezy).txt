(Young Jeezy):  
It's M.C. and Y.J.  
Another hit, okay  
We lookin' fine  
Takin' off  
Saw us on a runway  
On any given Sunday  
Monday, Tuesday  
They try to confuse me  
I never let 'em use me  
  
(Mariah Carey):  
I was a girl  
You was a man  
I was too young  
To understand  
I was naive  
I just believed  
Everything  
That you told me  
Said you were strong  
Protecting me  
Then I found out  
That you were weak  
Keepin' me there  
Under your thumb  
Cause you were scared  
That I'd become much  
More than you could handle  
Shining like a chandelier  
That decorated  
Every room inside  
The private hell we built  
And I dealt with it  
Like a kid  
I wished  
I could fly away  
  
But instead  
I kept my tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Don't regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin' up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming 'bout  
The violent times  
Still little protective  
'Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin' folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal  
With the side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
  
It didn't stop  
No one was there  
Couldn't be real  
Had to keep quiet  
Once in awhile  
Put up a fight  
It's just too much  
Night after night  
After awhile  
I would just lie  
You was dead wrong  
Said you was right  
Did what I could  
Just to survive  
Couldn't believe  
This was my life  
Flickering like a candle  
Do my best to handle  
Sleeping with the enemy  
Whether he was smothering  
Every last part of me  
So I broke away  
And finally found  
The strength to leave  
  
Still kept the tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Don't regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin' up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming  
'Bout the violent times  
Still little protective  
'Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin' folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal  
With the side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let's go  
  
(Young Jeezy):  
Hey Magnifico  
Or should I say  
Magnificent?  
Ain't nothing worth  
Your happiness  
And I ain't caring  
Who you're  
With misery love company  
So we ain't tryin'  
To hang with y'all  
Hurt you  
If ya let 'em in  
Gotta keep ya  
Sucka smilin'  
Keep tryin' to play  
I tell him  
I ain't blowin' tho  
Think they want me  
Outta here  
I tell 'em  
I ain't goin' tho  
Side effects  
Bbe drowsiness  
Loneliness  
How is this?  
I think the call  
It hateration  
What can you  
Prescribe for this?  
  
(Mariah) (2x):  
Forgive but I can't forget  
Every day I deal with this  
I live  
With the side efffects  
But I ain't gonna let them  
Get the best of me  
  
Kept my tears inside  
Cause I knew  
If I started  
I'd keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Don't regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin' up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming  
'Bout the violent times  
Still little protective  
'Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin' folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal  
With the side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)  
Side effects  
(Oh, oh)
