Uncle Slim had let her know she couldn't ride that horse  
He was the one that was only meant for men  
She walked around till way after dark  
Rode that horse with all her heart  
And in the night how she rode  
  
[Chorus]  
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside  
And even if she fell she'd survive  
In spite of all the tears she may cry  
This is how she has to live her life  
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself  
  
Mama and daddy told her from the start he was no good  
They'd seen how he treated the other girls  
She waited around till the sun went down  
Slipped out of the house not makin' a sound  
And in the night oh how they drove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was fifteen years to the day he became a stranger in her eyes  
In the coldest words of anger  
He said without me you won't survive  
  
There's a suitcase in the closet she had packed six months ago  
She don't leave a note that's not her style  
So she waited around till way after dark  
Left that man who broke her heart  
Now she's gone, oh she's gone  
  
[Chorus]
