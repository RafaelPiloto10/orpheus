Well I stood by the streetlight  
And I whispered your name  
To the circle of darkness again  
In the mercury night  
The snow fell like cocaine  
But all I want for Christmas is you  
I'd been out with some good friends  
And we raised a glass or two  
It's the time of the year to get loose  
Like a dog on the freeway  
With the headlights in my eyes  
All I get from you is the truth  
I don't need a new Cadillac  
Or a new set of clothes  
Just Donner and Blitzen  
To bring me fresh mistletoe  
And make my world  
A world  
Where love don't get old  
Cause all I want for Christmas is you  
Well I stand in the spotlight  
But it's always royal blue  
And It won't bring you back here  
That's true  
I got my name in lights  
Strung out on the avenue  
And all I want for Christmas is you  
I don't need a new Cadillac  
Or a new suit of clothes  
Just Donner and Blitzen  
To bring me fresh mistletoe  
And make my world  
A world  
Where love don't get old  
Cause all I want for Christmas is you  
All I want for Christmas is you  
Yeah  
All I want for Christmas is you  
Yeah baby
