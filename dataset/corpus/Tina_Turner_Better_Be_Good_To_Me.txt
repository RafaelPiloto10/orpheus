A prisoner of your love  
Entangled in your web  
Hot whispers in the night  
I'm captured by your spell  
Oh yes I'm touched by this show of emotion  
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion  
Should I, should I?  
  
You better be good to me  
That's how it's gotta be now  
Cause I don't have no use  
For what you loosely call the truth  
You better be good to me  
  
I think it's also right  
That we don't need to fight  
We stand face to face  
And you present your case  
And I know you keep telling me that you love me  
And I really do want to believe  
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith  
Oh sure babe, anything to please you  
  
You better be good to me  
That's how it's gotta be now  
Cause I don't have the time  
For your over loaded lines  
You better be good to me  
  
And I really don't see why it's so hard to be good to me  
And I don't understand what's your plan that you can't be good to me  
What I can't feel I surely cannot see, why can't you be good to me  
And if it's not real I do not wish to see, why can't you be good to me
