Chours:  
So cold,  
So cold,  
Bringing back all the memories of winter,  
Remembering when we were little,  
Playin in the snow and fighting all day yea yea,(Chours ends)  
I remember making snow man on the snowy days,  
I remember everything,  
And i won't forget my best friends,  
Chours,  
Its so cold,  
So cold,  
To think about my life,  
But i'll never forget my best friends,  
Chours  
So cold,  
So cold,  
Remember when we were little,  
Playin in the snow and fighting all day yea yea  
So cold,  
So cold,  
Remembering when we were little,  
Playin in the snow and fighting all day yea yea,  
Its'd so cold,  
So cold,  
To think about my days,
