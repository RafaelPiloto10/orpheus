Do you like the way it feels when you get hurt?  
Maybe you should take a long hard look at your self-worth  
There's an emptiness inside  
It started many years ago  
You always try to fill it up  
It's a familiar place you go  
One day you'll just have to wake up, girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know you got a lot to learn  
You've got to do it for yourself  
Find your own direction, don't rely on someone else  
You got to know it in your heart  
You've got to build it up with love, it isn't hard to rise above  
Wake up, you don't want to make up  
You've got to do it for yourself  
  
I know it feels sometimes that loneliness is worse  
And with every change there comes a melancholy search  
Now you can walk away from this  
It doesn't have to bring you down  
Have faith in destiny you what goes around, comes around  
You don't have to stay and take it, girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got nowhere to run  
Got nowhere to hide  
These changes will come if you just open your eyes  
Got nowhere to run  
Got nowhere to hide  
  
You gotta do it for yourself  
You gotta know it in your heart  
It isn't hard to rise above
