(jack hues)  
Tall trees in a blue sky  
Stand together don't ask why  
Stretch up to the blue sky  
Pierce that ceiling if you try  
You say these feelings do not last  
Well I am gonna prove you wrong  
You say our future's in the past  
But I am gonna turn you on  
Bright leaves in the sunshine  
Pick me up when I feel down  
Deep freeze if we don try  
Seems like we go round and round  
You say a dream will not last  
Well I am gonna prove you wrong  
You say our future's in the past  
But I am gonna turn you on  
Chorus:  
You and me could last forever  
If only we could stand together like  
Tall trees in a blue sky  
Like tall trees in a blue sky  
It's a deep freeze if we don't try  
Big man in a blue tie  
Tells you things must be this way  
Tall tree when the man dies  
Haven't heard a word he say  
You say these feelings do not last  
Well I am gonna prove you wrong  
You say our future's in the past  
But I am gonna turn you on  
I am gonna turn you on  
I am gonna turn you on  
I am gonna turn you on  
You and me could last forever  
If only we could stand together like  
Tall trees in a blue sky  
It's a deep freeze if we don't try  
Like tall trees in a blue sky  
It's a deep freeze when the bombs fly
