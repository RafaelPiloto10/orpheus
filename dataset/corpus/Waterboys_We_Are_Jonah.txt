And the well known fox  
Stepped up to make his speech  
His ship was on the rocks  
And rescue out of reach  
Spotlit he stood  
Said what he thought he should  
  
Half the crowd did laugh  
Though there was no joke  
And soon the other half  
Were swallowed up in smoke  
A robber on the wing  
Could be heard to sing  
The strangest thing  
  
Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale  
Then the plane did land  
For some it did not crash  
  
From it emerged a man  
In trainers and mustache  
Down he laid his load  
Upon the hated road  
Then the road did part  
And the tar did melt  
He loosened up his heart  
He tightened up his belt  
Like a piece of string  
Then he began to sing  
Like a pearly king !  
  
Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale  
Then the scene did shift  
To a sun kissed sea  
There was Montgomery Clift,  
  
Jonah, the whale and me  
As the sun it set  
Montgomery placed his bet  
Then the whale did yawn  
And fell asleep in four  
From dusk till dawn  
You should have heard him snore  
From Tierra Del Fuego  
To the Alaskan snows  
There she blows  
  
Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale  
My dear old Grandma  
We are Jonah  
Rolling along  
In the teeth of the whale!
