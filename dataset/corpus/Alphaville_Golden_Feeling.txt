Though this place is so crowded  
You feel so alone 'cause you're eye to eye with him  
And you know he will take you  
He's got nothing to lose and there's no way for you to win  
Desperados in love won't kill this sweet dove  
For nuggets of fleeting bliss  
C'mon, c'mon you can't escape  
The bleeding bullet of a kiss  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine  
It's a new situation  
The start of a game, you've already won the prize  
He's a lunatic dancer  
Who's not aware that he's skating on thin ice  
There's no turning back  
No time for regrets, you should've known better, though  
Another chance to fall in love  
Another chance to turn you on  
Another chance to turn you on  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine
