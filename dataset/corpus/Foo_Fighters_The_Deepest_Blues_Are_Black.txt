Shame on you  
Seducing everyone  
Faded you  
Your diamond in the rough  
  
You don't have to tell me  
I know where you've been  
Shinning once again  
  
Will you do  
The thing you've always done  
Tell me true  
I think you know the one  
  
One that makes me blurry  
Colors start to run  
  
Every time I wonder  
I go under  
  
The deeper the blues  
The more I see black  
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back  
All the deepest blues are black
