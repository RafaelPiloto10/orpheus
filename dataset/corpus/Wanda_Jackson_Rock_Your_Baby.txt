Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Take me in your arms and whisper low  
Then rock your baby and don't be slow  
  
Birds was made to sit in a tree  
You were made to dance with me  
Here's your chance, now, don't go wrong  
Gotta rock your baby, all night long  
  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Take me in your arms and whisper low  
Then rock your baby and don't be slow  
  
I got my hair fixed in a pony tail  
So when we dance it'll really sail  
If you love me, then tell me so  
But rock your baby and don't be slow  
  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Rock your baby, all night long  
Take me in your arms and whisper low  
Then rock your baby and don't be slow
