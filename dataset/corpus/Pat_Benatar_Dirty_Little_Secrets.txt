It seems I loved you for so long  
It seems like all of my life  
Just like a child who doesn't belong  
You'd turn, 'til even the sun became your shadow  
And I hate you in your innocence, you know  
But I hate myself even more for lovin' you so  
  
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go  
  
Nobody's perfect, certainly not us  
We've all got secrets to keep  
I would have kept yours safe in my heart  
You would have always known where to find me  
And I know you better that I know myself, you know  
So why pretend you've got somewhere else to go  
  
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go  
  
Sometimes it hurt so bad that you cry  
Then there's the times you wish you had died  
Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie, sometimes  
Sometimes it's best to lock it away  
In a place that's secret and safe  
Sometimes you just pretend you don't know  
Sometimes it's best to let go  
  
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go
