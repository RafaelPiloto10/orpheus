Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand  
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Singin' silent night with the palm trees a blowing  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Well if you're thinkin' 'bout gettin' me a present this year  
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear  
How 'bout two tickets to a tropical shore  
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore  
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi mahi grillin'  
And pina coladas in the blender chillin'  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand  
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Singin' silent night with the palm trees blowing  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Well everybody's praying for a Christmas of white  
Come to think about it that'll be alright  
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground  
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown  
  
Well string some lights in a coconut tree  
I rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand  
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Baby won't you say you and me will be goin'  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
I can almost feel my toes in the sand  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Don't worry baby we'll celebrate plenty  
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini  
We won't have to worry 'bout the holiday rush  
It'll be you and me falling deeper in love  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
