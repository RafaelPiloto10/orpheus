They finally got the nerve to tell me  
Your no longer wanted hangin' around  
I knew all along it would-a happened  
So there this-a new place darlin', that I found.  
  
And it's just on the outskirts of somewhere  
The only traffic is downward bound  
It's alright, to try our love 'cause I've been so far out  
Perhaps the sun will go down between my house and town.  
  
Please don't feel sorry darlin', 'cause you hurt me  
Love just moved away for your, your little man  
I could feel this bad, bad day a-comin'  
So there's this new place darlin', that I plan.  
  
And it's just on the outskirts of somewhere  
The only traffic is downward bound  
It's alright to cry out loud 'cause I've been so far out  
So that the sun will go down between my house and town.  
  
Yeah, the sun will go down between my house and town
