I've gotta run away from you  
If I wanna save myself  
And there's nothing I can do  
To break your magic spell  
You are evil and you show it  
With your eyes  
Oh, and the way your body moves  
Just keeps me hipnotized  
Cause I'm a prisoner of love  
Someone rescue me  
Release me from this state of mind  
I was born to be free  
Just a prisoner of love  
Come on let me be cause if loving you is my crime  
Go on and close the door on me  
  
Oh, I've been convicted for the crime  
I have been done  
But if losing you is my sentence  
I'd rather lose my life  
Can someone help me  
Help me keep my sanity  
Cause I love this evil force  
That's taking over me  
Cause I'm a prisoner of love  
Someone rescue me  
Release me from this state of mind  
I was born to be free  
Just a prisoner of love  
Come on let me be  
Cause if loving you is my crime  
Go on and close the door on me  
Cause I'm a prisoner of love  
Someone rescue me  
Release me from this state of mind  
I was born to be free  
Just a prisoner of love  
Come on let me be  
Cause if loving you is my crime  
Go on and close the door on me
