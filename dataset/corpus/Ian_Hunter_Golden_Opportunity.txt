The kids are ok  
They're telling you now  
But you're letting them down  
Cause you just don't know how  
And it's a golden opportunity  
  
I'm spinning in space  
I'm laughing away  
Your so pathetic  
I can just hear them say  
It's like a golden opportunity  
  
You better hear it  
See hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
Get near it  
It's a golden opportunity  
  
We reckon they're rats  
Now see how they run  
My house is so common  
And we're dumb we're so dumb  
And it's a golden opportunity  
  
Scream all you suckers  
Scream all you can  
I'm losing my bluff  
It's a scam its a scam  
And it's a golden opportunity  
  
You better hear it  
You better hear it hear it  
It's like a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it hear it  
It's like a golden opportunity  
Alright!  
You better hear it hear it  
Hear it hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
Hear it  
Hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it  
It's a golden opportunity
