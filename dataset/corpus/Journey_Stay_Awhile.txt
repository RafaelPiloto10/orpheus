I'd do anything to hold you.  
I'd go anywhere to touch you.  
I'd do anything you want me to,  
If you'll just stay with me awhile.  
  
I'd sing any song your heart desires.  
I would sing out loud of love's sweet fires.  
Oh, I'd do all this and so much more.  
If you'll just stay with me awhile.  
  
Reach out your hand,  
Oh, to me.  
Oh, I'm fallin'  
One minute more,  
I'm fallin'  
I'm fallin'  
Oh, oh, fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'  
Won't you just stay with me awhile?
