Could it be we're the perfect pair?  
Have it all if we'd only dare  
I have dreamed of a night like this  
Maybe you will end my loneliness  
Meeting you was a dangerous thing  
Can't control what is happening  
Stood my ground, didn't run away  
Trying hard to hide that I'm so afraid  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Shall I take another chance on love?  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Shall I take another chance on love?  
When it feels so right  
That I'm safe and warm inside  
Take a chance and fall tonight  
Guess my heart's on the borderline  
Couldn't stand it not to work this time  
It's hard to fight when it feels so good  
If there's something, don't you think that we should  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Shall I take another chance on love?  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Shall I take another chance on love?  
When it feels so right  
That I'm safe and warm inside  
Take a chance and fall tonight
