Another time, another place  
Her candles flicker in the fading light  
I sit alone and watch that lonely night  
I see you everywhere and I try desperately to hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Another time, another place, I see that old familiar face  
And I try hard to catch your eye  
Another road, another mile, I see that old familiar smile  
But you'll be with somebody new  
Another night, another day, I'll see you standing in my way  
I'll stop and say "hello, my friend"  
Another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine  
  
And walk away from me once more.  
I try to run away from sad regrets  
The bitter wine won't help me to forget  
That I locked up my heart and threw away the precious key  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another night, another day, I'll see you standing in my way  
I'll stop and say "hello, my friend"  
Another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine  
And walk away from me once more.
