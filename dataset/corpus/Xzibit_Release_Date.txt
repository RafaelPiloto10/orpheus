Yeah, today the big day  
(Xzibit)  
Been here four years, eleven months and twenty-nine hot ones  
One more day and I'm a free man walkin  
Leavin from behind these gates, I paid my debt to the state  
And ever since they took the weights  
Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin  
Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend  
Remember like it's yesterday, eight-teen and ?  
I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them  
Goin for a ride that I cannot stop  
Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots  
And for those that don't know, that's the Pen-East to Fresno  
Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck "Let's Make a Deal"  
Livin around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will  
At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that  
Niggaz givin up the manhood they can't get back  
It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum  
Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles  
More than that I'm missin my kids  
Missin my turf, missin my bitch, what could be worse?  
Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit)  
Some nigga picked up, wanted to break her neck  
When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back  
Cause when you pick em up and read em that's where you're at  
And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back  
Level four right away, gettin hit the same day  
Playin the price for the games you play  
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away  
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like  
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life  
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened  
Tacs gettin taced up, plottin and talkin  
Sellin everything from weed to blow  
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know  
niggaz holdin weight, essays got the power  
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours  
? tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters  
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off  
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit  
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch  
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak  
And then physically and mentally cannot compete  
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster  
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster  
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin  
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin  
Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count  
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz that's freshed out  
But some of these niggaz on swipe  
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked  
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans  
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans  
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands  
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again  
On all times take the long walk to the front gate  
Dress out expandin shit, today my release date  
  
(Talking)  
[X] Alright my niggaz, I'm gone, see you in an ounce dog, woo!  
[G] What's up nigga  
[X] Yeah, what's up nigga  
[G] Hey get in the car, my nigga, sup X?  
Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga  
Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker  
[X] Ha, yeah right  
Check it out dog, everybody know that you just got out  
That shit was all on the radio  
But dig it I got two strippin bitches  
just flew in from motherfuckin Las Vegas  
ready to get down and dirty, I got a pound of weed, got on the Hennessy  
Everybody at the club waitin, what you want to do?  
[X] Take me to the motherfuckin studio
