Government man keep calling my house  
Talking 'bout I owe, harassing my spouse  
Gotta park my truck on another block  
'Cause the sub-prime loan got my ass in hock  
  
Gotta couple good friends with helping hands  
I need a brand new job with a health care plan  
They closed the plant, they stole my job  
And told me crime don't pay unless you ask the mob  
  
So I smoke a little grass, drink a little wine  
Watch a little tube, try to kill a little time  
And every single day I fall a little more behind  
But I'm paying it no mind, it'll all be fine  
  
I get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I ain't gonna lie  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I ain't gonna lie (got it good)  
  
Party people in the place to be  
Put your hands in the sky if you barely getting by  
It's on and on till the brake of dawn  
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on  
  
Yes yes y'all and it never stops  
I don't trust the government, I don't trust no cops  
We dip and we dive and we socialize  
We struggle and we strive just to stay alive  
  
I get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by (got it good, got it good)  
  
When I finally get home I can't relax  
'Cause I've been over worked and I've been over taxed  
My bank accounts empty, all my cards are maxed  
And I ain't looking for no pity, I'm just stating the facts  
  
I voted for some change and it's kinda strange  
Now it's all I got in my pocket  
I bought a few LED's, now I'm growing some trees  
And it's a sweet fucking hustle don't knock it  
  
I told y'all before I would break the law  
To put some food in my baby girl's belly  
'Cause the senator man took a bribe in hand  
And went and shipped my job to New Delhi  
  
I get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I ain't gonna lie  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I ain't gonna lie (got it good)  
  
Party people in the place to be  
Put your hands in the sky if you barely getting by  
It's on and on till the brake of dawn  
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on  
Yes yes y'all and it never stops  
I don't trust the government  
I don't trust no cops  
I dip and I dive and I socialize  
I struggle and I strive just to stay alive  
  
I get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by (got it good, got it good)  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I ain't gonna lie  
I barely get by  
I laugh not to cry  
I stay a little high  
I ain't gonna lie (got it good)
