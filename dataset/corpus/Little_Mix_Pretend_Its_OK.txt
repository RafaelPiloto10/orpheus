What would you do? What would you say?  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
I remember the day when we were out all night  
I wish that I can get the day back and tell you it's alright  
Cause we all do the same thing, we just don't realize  
That we're living on borrowed time  
  
What would you do? What would you say?  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
I see the light that I'm chasing  
A memory, but it's fading  
When it's gone I'll be waiting  
Knowing it's too late (knowing it's too late)  
You chose the road that I'm walking  
Now it's your soul that I'm caught in  
And you're not hearing when I'm calling  
Calling your name  
  
One breath, one step, one life, one heart  
Two words, two eyes, new beginning, new start  
Too neat, too narrow, too short, too bright,  
I'm there with you, here by my side  
  
What would you do? What would you say?  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
Nothing here, no one talking, knowing it's too late  
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's OK  
Nothing here, no one talking, nothing's gonna change  
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's OK  
  
What would you do? (what would you do?)  
What would you say? (what would you say?)  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
What would you do? (what would you do?)  
What would you say? (what would you say?)  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
Oh yeah  
What would you do? What would you say?  
Pretending it's OK  
What would you do? What would you say?
