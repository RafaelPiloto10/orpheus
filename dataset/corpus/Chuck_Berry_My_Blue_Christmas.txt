If I could only have an hour of this holiday with you  
We could sit and rap together, spinning records old and new  
Have a little cake and a bit o' coke now and do the things we used to do  
  
Jingle bells will all be ringing and little kids' eyes all aglow  
Children strolling, singing carols, makin' tracks out in the snow  
Oh, but I'll be with you this Christmas, maybe yes and maybe no  
  
Christmas time is really joyful, oh, but it's a lonely season, too  
Many people are so cheerful and some are alone and blue  
What would make my Christmas happy if I could have it all alone with you  
  
But if I just can't be with you, let me call you on the phone  
I wanna tell you I still love you and how it feels to be alone  
Wanna wish you a merry Christmas as the old year passes on.
