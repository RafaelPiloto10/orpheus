I want to take you down to the side of the city  
Where the sun doesn't shine and the moon isn't pretty  
The slow train crawls in the nights and the days  
Are as warm as the smoke and the heat haze  
Yes and neon here twenty-four hours of the day  
And you're sure looking pretty when it's hitting on your face  
Looker on the corner take that dog for a donor  
Well she's only doing what her mother told her  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I want to see a touch of evil in your eye  
But all that I'm getting babe is sweetness and lies  
I want to see something that I might desire  
I want to take you down babe into the mire  
Deals going down no chance no masking  
One thing's for sure never get what you're asking  
They're coming with johnsons, they're coming with knives  
They're robbing your boots when they give you a shoe shine  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right downtown  
Slow train down, babe, try twenty-nine  
There's no looking back when there's no sense of time  
'Cause it's neon here twenty-four hours of the day  
And you're sure looking pretty when it's hitting on your face  
With a touch of evil in your eye  
With a touch of evil in your eye  
I want to take you down to the side of the city  
I want to take you down to the blur of the city  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
Yes I want to take you right down  
I... I... I... I want to take you  
I... I... I... I want to take you  
I... Yes I want to take you right downtown
