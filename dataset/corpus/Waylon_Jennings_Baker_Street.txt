Winding your way down on Baker Street  
Lite in your head and dead on your feet  
Well, another crazy day you drink the night away  
And forget about everything.  
  
These city streets make you feel so cold  
It's got so many people but it's got no soul  
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong  
When you thought it held everything.  
  
Used to think that it was so easy  
Used to say that it was so easy  
You're tryin', you're tryin' now  
Another year and then you'd be happy  
One more year and then you'd be happy  
You're cryin', you're cryin' now.  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
You open the door he's got that look on his face  
And he asks you where you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about anything.  
  
He's got this dream about buyin' some land  
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands  
Then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town  
And forget about everything.  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
Know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone  
And when you wake up it's a new morning  
The sun is shining it's a new morning  
You're goin' you're goin' home
