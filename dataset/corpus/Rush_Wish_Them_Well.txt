All that you can do is wish them well  
All that you can do is wish them well [x2]  
  
Spirits turned bitter by the poison of envy  
Always angry and dissatisfied  
Even the lost ones, the frightened and mean ones  
Even the ones with a devil inside  
  
Thank your stars you're not that way  
Turn your back and walk away  
Don't even pause and ask them why  
Turn around and say goodbye  
  
All that you can do is wish them well  
All that you can do is wish them well  
  
People who judge without a measure of mercy  
All the victims who will never learn  
Even the lost ones, you can only give up on  
Even the ones who make you burn  
  
Thank your stars you're not that way  
Turn your back and walk away  
  
Don't even pause and ask them why  
Turn around and say goodbye [x2]  
  
The ones who've done you wrong  
The ones who pretended to be so strong  
The grudges you've held for so long  
It's not worth singing that same sad song [x2]  
  
Thank your stars you're not that way  
Turn your back and walk away  
Don't even pause and ask them why  
Turn around and say goodbye [x2]  
  
All that you can do is wish them well  
All that you can do is wish them well  
All that you can do is wish them well  
  
Even though you're going through hell  
Just keep on going  
Let the demons dwell  
  
Just wish them well
