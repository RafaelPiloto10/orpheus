[Intro]  
Ah get on the floor and dance  
Ah, on the floor and dance  
  
[Chorus]  
So get on the floor  
And dance with me  
I love the way you shake your thing  
Especially  
  
[1st Verse]  
There's a chance for dancin'  
All night long  
There's a chance for groovin'  
And it will be soothing  
With a song  
  
[Bridge]  
Then why don't you just  
Dance across the floor  
'Cause there's a chance for chances  
And the chance is choosin'  
And I sure would like just to groove with you  
  
[Chorus]  
So get on the floor  
And dance with me  
I love the way you shake your thing  
Especially  
So get on the floor  
And dance with me  
I love the way you shake that thing (girl)  
Especially  
  
[2nd Verse]  
No need for rejection  
Determined to be  
Gonna groove gonna move ya  
Gonna say things to ya  
Just wait and see  
  
[Bridge]  
Then why don't you just  
Dance across the floor  
'Cause there's a chance for choices  
And it's you I'm choosin'  
And I sure would like just to groove with you  
  
[Chorus]  
So get on the floor  
And dance with me  
I love the way you shake your thing  
Especially  
  
So get on the floor  
And dance with me  
I love the way you shake that thing girl  
Especially

Shake your body won't you g'on get down  
Get up won't you g'on down  
Shake your body won't you g'on get down...  
  
[Chorus]  
So get on the floor

Especially  
So get on the floor  
And dance with me  
I love the way you shake your thing (girl)
