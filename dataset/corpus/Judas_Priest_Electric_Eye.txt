Up here in space  
I'm looking down on you  
My lasers trace  
Everything you do  
  
You think you've private lives  
Think nothing of the kind  
There is no true escape  
I'm watching all the time  
  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
I'm protected electric eye  
  
Always in focus  
You can't feel my stare  
I zoom into you  
You don't know I'm there  
  
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves  
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove  
  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
I'm protected electric eye  
  
Electric eye, in the sky  
Feel my stare, always there  
There's nothing you can do about it  
Develop and expose  
I feed upon your every thought  
And so my power grows  
  
I'm made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
I'm protected electric eye  
  
I'm elected electric spy  
  
I'm Elected. Protected. Detective. Electric eye
