My boat sails stormy seas  
Battles oceans filled with tears  
At last my port's in view  
Now that I've discovered you  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady  
  
As life goes drifting by  
Like a breeze she'll gently sigh  
And slowly bow her head  
Then you'll hear her softly cry.  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady  
  
Words that you say when we're alone  
Though actions speak louder than words  
But all I can say is I love you so  
To drive away all my hurt  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady  
  
Set sail before the sun  
Feel the warmth that's just begun  
Share each and every dream  
They belong to everyone.  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady
