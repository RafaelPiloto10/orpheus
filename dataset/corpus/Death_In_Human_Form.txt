People of the earth beware,  
It is here in human form  
An atrocity laced with greed.  
Filled with evil intentions.  
Ready to attack  
  
Look to the air for stories to choose,  
Who will be your next victim  
Profitting on visions of others,  
dark emotions run through its veins  
Its motives are false its mind is insane  
A distant planet with no signs of life  
To become a home for this alien breed.  
Scientists of the world unite,  
your services are more than needed  
This creature in human form is out of control  
  
Looks can be deceiving, see beyond the shell  
Flesh and eyes mean nothing.  
The truth, time it will tell  
Before you think you fool the world.  
What comes around goes around.  
Shown for what you are, a waste of life
