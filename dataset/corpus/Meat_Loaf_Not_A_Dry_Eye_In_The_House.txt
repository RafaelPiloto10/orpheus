Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
I can still see you standing there.  
Midnight wind blowin' through your hair.  
Kisses sweet in the salty air.  
When love was forever.  
Turn the page and we fade to blue.  
The scene has changed now I'm without you.  
Walked away when the act was through.  
And the dream was over.  
It was almost like a movie  
The way you said goodbye.  
You must have a lot of time rehearsing each and every line.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
The greatest story was you and me.  
Had it all we had everything, but now the.  
Story's done it's just history.  
The last act is over.  
You every line had the sweetest sound.  
Your every touch turned my world around.  
But the light came up and my world crashed down.  
End of show  
It's over.  
It was almost like a movie.  
Those nights we touched the stars.  
Time stood still for you and I.  
Now it's sad enough to make you cry.  
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Act one  
The story's just begun.  
Act two  
I fell in love with you.  
Act three  
Knew it was meant to be.  
Act four  
You don't love me no more.  
And there's not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a smile left on my face.  
The ending's just too sad to take.  
And there's not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
After loves curtain comes down.  
Listen and you'll hear the sound.  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Not a dry eye in the house.  
Not a dry eye in the house.
