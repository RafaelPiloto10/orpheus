Well I told you once and I told you twice and I ain't gonna tended to you no
more  
  
You don't do nothin' that I tell you anyway  
  
And now you're tellin' me to walk out your door  
  
Ain't no denyin' you been lyin' ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'  
  
Ain't do much choosin' that I'm losin' losin' you  
  
[ guitar ]  
  
I finally find out the way you are and it's so hard for me to take  
  
I can't understand your feelin's I wish I had known before it was too late  
  
Ain't no denyin'...  
  
[ guitar ]  
  
Ain't no denyin'...  
  
Ain't no denyin'...
