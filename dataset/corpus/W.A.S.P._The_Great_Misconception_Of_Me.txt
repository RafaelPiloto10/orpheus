Welcome to the show, the great finale's finally here  
I thank you for coming into my theater of fear  
Welcome to the show, you're all witnesses, you see  
A privileged invitation to the last rites of me  
Remember me? You can't save me  
Mama, you never needed me  
No crimson king, look in my eyes, you'll see  
Mama, I'm lonely, it's only me, it's only me  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million eyes, of a million  
I am the prisoner of the paradise I dreamed  
The idol of a million, lonely faces look at me  
Behind the mask of sorrow, four doors of doom behind my eyes  
I've got their footprints all across my crimson mind  
Long live, long live  
Long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
There is no love to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
No love to shelter me, only love, love set me free  
I was the warrior with an anthem in my soul  
The idol of eight thousand, lonely days of rage ago  
And remember me when it comes your time to choose  
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true  
Long live, long live  
Long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
There is no love to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
No love to shelter me, only love, love set me free  
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?  
The straps on my back  
Red, crimson red, no, I was never to be  
Only one crimson son, no, it never was me  
Living in the limelight, little did I know  
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul  
It was all I ever wanted, everything I dreamed  
But the dream became my nightmare, no one could hear me scream  
With these six-strings, I make a noose  
To take my life, it's time to choose  
The headlines read of my demise, yeah, suicide, of my suicide  
Oh, sweet silence, where is the sting?  
I am no idol, no crimson king  
I'm the impostor, the world has seen  
My father was the idol, it was never me  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, no, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million eyes  
No love, to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
No love, to shelter me, only love, love set me free
