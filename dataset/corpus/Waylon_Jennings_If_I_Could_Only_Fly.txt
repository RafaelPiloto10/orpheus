This morning as I watched a bird  
Just spread its wings and fly  
It was then a thought came over me  
And I wondered why can't I  
Oh why, oh why can't I?  
  
If I could only fly you see  
A lot of problems would be gone  
When you think of just  
How much I'd save on shoes alone  
If I could only fly.  
  
I would never tear my clothes  
Climbing in and out of trees  
If I could only fly I'd never crawl  
Or wear holes in my knees  
If I could only fly.  
  
How I'd love to spread my wings  
And streak across the sky  
I'd be off to see the world  
If I could only fly.  
  
But I'd always come right back
