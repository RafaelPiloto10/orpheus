[Chorus]  
If its a problem  
Gon let me know  
And if it ain't shit  
Nigga gon let it go  
But while it's on my mind  
I need to let you kno  
Them choppas on deck  
  
And I ain't afraid to let em' go [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Yea I'll do ya do ya (do ya bad do ya bad)  
  
[Repeat: x 2]  
You on that dumb shit, ain't wit it man  
That's the main reason murders get committed man  
It can go down any minute man  
Whole squad jump out that black on black many man  
  
So you betta be quick and on ya toes  
Where dem choppa bullets stop nobody knows  
Babies crying niggas dying all ova da place  
Mamma crying 'cause is blood all ova her face  
This is not a game this is not a test  
Swiss cheese ya brain mayne you be laid to rest  
I'll bust yo head ask questions lata  
Throw yo duces sianara to you hatas  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know ya bitch she don't know me either  
I suggest you keep it moving if you wanna keep her  
You don't want these problems that's a bad idea  
Machetti have ya ass running like diarrhia  
Nobody move nobody get hurt, shit  
If I pull dat tube errybody hit da dirt  
Look dis could be da boy dat if you only keep it coo nigga act like you growin
steady still in middle  
Schoo nigga you don't really want dis beef bra put in back in the freeza  
You'll freeze up when I pull the heat then squeeze pull them knees up  
This is not a game this is not a test slow ya roll fo' you be laid to rest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll sell you wet dope just to make it wheigh right  
Call dem boys set you up in broad daylight  
Yea I'll bang ya bitch I'll do you bad  
9 months later now she screamin yur da dad  
If you loose ya bun say I neva found da shit  
If I owe ya guap pay ya ass wit counterfeit  
Oh yea I'll flex ya nigga don't think I caint  
Have my broad put some suga in ya gas tank  
Catch a break line slash ya back tire  
When ya crank ya car ya engine catch fire  
Now I don't kno what you been told  
But these are free prescriptions  
  
[Chorus]
