No one to talk with  
All by myself  
No one to walk with  
But I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin'  
I'm savin' my love for you  
I know for certain  
The one I love  
I'm through with flirtin'  
It's just you I'm thinkin' of  
Ain't misbehavin'  
I'm savin' my love for you  
Like Jack Horner  
In the corner  
Don't go nowhere  
What do I care  
Your kisses  
Are worth waiting for  
Believe me  
I don't stay out late  
Don't care to go  
I'm home about eight  
Just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin'  
I'm savin' my-y love for you  
Like Jack Horner  
In the corner  
Don't go nowhere  
What do I care  
Your kisses  
Are worth waiting for  
Believe me-ee  
I don't stay out late  
Don't care to go  
I'm home about eight  
Just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin'  
I'm saving my love for you...
