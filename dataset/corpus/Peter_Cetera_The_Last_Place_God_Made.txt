I've seen the best of times  
I've seen the worst of times  
'Been around and I've taken my chances  
(But) I could never be tied down  
Too many questions, not enough answers  
  
Then I laid eyes on you  
I knew right there and then  
This would be more than a passing encounter  
My fate is bound to yours  
I've found a cause right here  
  
And if this is the last place God made  
And yours is the last face I see  
Just feeling close to you  
That's good enough for me  
  
We've seen the best of times  
We've seen the worst of times  
Been through hell and high water together  
Diamond bright and tear stained mem'ries  
These are the times I'll remember forever  
  
If you believe in me, like I believe in you  
Without a care for the why or the wherefore  
I will be there for you  
And you'll be there for me  
  
And If this is the last place God made  
And yours is the last face I see  
Just feeling close to you  
It's good enough for me  
  
If this is the last place God made  
You know it's the only place I want to be  
Just feeling close to you  
That's good enough for me  
  
If this is the last place God made  
You know it's the only place I want to be  
Just feeling close to you  
It's good enough for me
