When the last breath of life is gone from my body and my lips are as cold as
the sea  
When my friends gather round to my farewell party  
Please won't you pretend you love me  
There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I'll go  
And leave you in this old world alone  
Will you shed a tear at my farewell party or will you be glad when I'm gone  
Don't be angry with me a wanting to keep you  
Till my life in this old world is done and through  
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party but I'll go away loving you  
There'll be flowers from those...
