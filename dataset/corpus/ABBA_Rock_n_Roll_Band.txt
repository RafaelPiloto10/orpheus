Sitting in the darkest corner  
In the tender light I saw her face  
She was looking so sad and lonely  
Someone help me, someone save me  
I could see the look she gave me, oh  
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only  
That I knew I could do  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n'roll band  
Let's go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
You've been sitting there for hours  
Try to hide behind the flowers now  
Baby, we could have fun together  
Come on, cheer up, let's get started  
No use being broken-hearted now  
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better  
Yes I know that you will  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Let's go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band
