I've had fame and fortune  
Women come knock on my door  
I've lived to the limit  
Maybe a little bit more  
  
There are so many stories  
About how I got out of control  
Some say it's a woman  
Some say it's my troubled soul  
  
I'm like a crazy old soldier  
Fighting a war on my own  
Just me and the whiskey  
And the bottles are ten thousand strong  
  
You'd think I'd give up  
As many times as I've been hit  
But like a crazy old soldier  
I just don't know when to quit  
  
Bar rooms and bedrooms  
Are just faces and places and names  
Once for the pleasure  
And Lord knows once for the pain  
  
I've tried to forget her  
And all of the things that we've done  
But as long as there are memories  
I'll never hang up my gun  
  
I'm like a crazy old soldier  
Fighting a war on my own  
Just me and the whiskey  
And the bottles are ten thousand strong  
  
You'd think, I'd give up  
As many times as I've been hit  
But like a crazy old soldier  
I just don't know when to quit  
  
Like a crazy old soldier  
I just don't know when to quit
