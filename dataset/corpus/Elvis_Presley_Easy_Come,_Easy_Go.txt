Easy come, easy go  
Here, there, everywhere, crazy love is in the air  
Nightfall, mmm, day and nightfall  
So many girls in every port  
You gotta be a juggernaut  
Full speed ahead or you'll be caught  
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  
  
Easy come, easy go  
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss  
And pound for pound, delicious  
Mmm so nutritious  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come, easy go  
  
All right!  
When you want love to keep you warm  
There's nothing like a uniform  
You got a port in any storm  
There she blows  
  
Easy come, easy go  
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss  
And pound for pound, delicious  
Mmm so nutritious  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come, easy go  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come, easy go  
Easy come, easy go
