Love of my life  
Take my heart take my soul  
Take what you need  
Love of my life  
Don't you know I'm just a fool for a good woman's greed  
You broke the wings of a weary vagabond  
And I'm stranded on the island of your love  
You are the fruit of my amazon  
Love of my life I'm no good on my own  
Love of my nights  
Take my pride take my flesh  
Take all my blues  
Love of my life  
Don't you know my life's a bore  
When there's nothing to lose  
I am the prisoner of your paradise  
Sunken in the bayou of your love  
I make this sensual sacrifice  
Love of my life  
For the good of my own  
Love of my life  
I'm no good on my own  
Love of my life  
Take my heart take my soul  
Take what you feel  
Love of my life  
Don't you know I'm just a man  
For a woman who's real  
Love of my life ....  
Love of my life ....  
Love of my life ....
