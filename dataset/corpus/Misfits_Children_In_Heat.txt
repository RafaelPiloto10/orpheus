Children in heat  
They have no conscience  
No resistance  
You gotta see this big reaction  
No resistance  
  
Cellophane sex, a new way of life  
With your heart in your throat  
And the other alive  
You've been pissin', pissin' blood  
Pissin' blood for seven days  
  
No resistance  
No resistance  
No resistance  
  
Children in heat  
You can't control them  
Why they're away and away  
They're always gonna run away  
  
Children in heat  
You can't control them  
Why they're running away  
  
Children in heat  
Are young little kindle wood  
I see them burning  
They all changed their names to Chicago  
  
No resistance  
No resistance  
No resistance  
  
Children in heat  
You can't control them  
Why they'm running away  
  
Children in heat  
You can't control them  
Why they're running away and away  
They're always gonna run away  
  
Children in heat  
You can't control them  
Why they're running away and away  
They're always gonna run away  
  
Children in heat  
You can't control them  
Why they're running away
