Is there cream in this soup?  
  
I look in the mirror, I know I'm not good enough to eat  
I'll tell you something, my hunger has nothing to do with greed  
So I bleed  
  
This is junkie love when you've got no sugar  
You behave like a wretch when you could be the Buddha  
You say it's you but I know it's me  
  
Is there cream in this soup, is there truth in this lie?  
A promise that was made in the strangest eye  
Would you kill for love, can you go the mile?  
Baby don't lie  
  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playin' such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearin' that line  
Same old line  
  
I look in the mirror, I know I'm not good enough to eat  
I'll tell you something, my hunger has nothin' to do with greed  
So feed me  
  
This is junkie love when you've got no sugar  
You live like a wretch when you should be the Buddha  
You say it's you but I know it's me  
  
Is there cream in this soup, is there truth in this lie?  
A promise that was made in the strangest eye  
Would you kill for love, would you do or die?  
Baby don't lie  
  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line  
  
Lie, lie, lie  
Lie, lie, lie  
Lie, lie, lie  
  
I never meant to hurt you, I don't know why  
You come with your lawyers and your alibi  
How can you look me straight in the eye  
When you know your truth is a lie, lie, lie  
  
Lie, lie  
Lie, lie  
Lie, lie, ohh  
  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line  
Take the needle off the record, it's been playing such a long time  
Take the needle off the record, I'm so tired of hearing that line, line, line  
  
Spill now, scream now  
  
Take the needle off the record, come on  
Take the needle off the record  
Take the needle off the record
