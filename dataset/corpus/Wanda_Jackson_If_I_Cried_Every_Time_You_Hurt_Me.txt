If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time  
If I made a scene each time you were mean we'd be quarrellin' all the time  
But I don't cry and I don't get mad I try to take the good with the bad  
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time  
  
[Strings]  
  
Now and then you say you love me I try to believe you do  
Then you turn right around and hurt me like I was nothing to you  
But I love you so and I'll stay somehow my tears won't flow and my head won't
bow  
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time
