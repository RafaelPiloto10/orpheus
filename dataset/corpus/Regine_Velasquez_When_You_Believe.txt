Many nights we've prayed  
With no proof anyone could hear  
In our hearts a hopeful song  
We barely understood  
  
Now we are not afraid  
Although we know there's much to fear  
We were moving mountains long  
Before we knew we could oh yes  
  
There can be miracles, when you believe  
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill  
Who knows what miracles you can achieve  
When you believe, somehow you will  
You will when you believe oh yeah  
  
In this time of fear  
When prayers so often prove in vain  
Hope seems like the summer birds  
So swiftly flown away  
  
Yet now I'm standing here  
My heart's so full I can't explain  
Seeking faith and speaking words  
I never thought I'd say  
  
There can be miracles, when you believe When you believe  
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill  
Who knows what miracles you can achieve You can achieve  
When you believe, somehow you will  
You will when you believe  
  
They don't always happen when you ask  
And it's easy to give in to your fears oh  
But when your blinded by your pain  
Can't see your way straight through the rain  
A small but still, resilient voice  
Says love is very near Yeah Yeah  
  
There can be miracles miracles  
When you believe lord when you believe oh ho  
Through hope is frail through hope is frail  
It's hard to kill it's hard to kill oh oh  
Who knows what miracles you can achieve  
When you believe ooh ooh  
Somehow you will  
Somehow you will  
You will when you believe  
  
You will when you believe  
Just believe Just believe oh yeah  
You will when you believe
