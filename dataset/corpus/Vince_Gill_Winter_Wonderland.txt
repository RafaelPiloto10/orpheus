Over the ground lies a mantel of white  
A heaven of diamonds  
Shine down through the night  
Two hearts are thrilling  
In spite of the chilling weather . . .  
  
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, are you married, we'll say, no man  
But you can do the job while you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid the plans that we made  
Walking in a winter wonderland
