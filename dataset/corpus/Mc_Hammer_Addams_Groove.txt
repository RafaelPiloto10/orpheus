They do what they want to do, say what they want to say  
Live how they want to live, play how they want to play  
Dance how they want to dance, kick and the slap a friend  
The Addams family  
  
Now I was cold coolin', you know (maxin' and relaxin')  
Just kickin' it around the house (Oaktown kicking' it)  
When a knock, a knock, a knock and a voice yo!  
Can hammer come out? (what's up?)  
Now I don't mind (mind) being a friend  
And showin' a little bit of flava (flava)  
But Wednesday, Pugsley, Gomez, Fester (oh man)  
Man, them some strange neighbors  
  
They do what they want to do, say what they want to say  
Live how they want to live, play how they want to play  
Dance how they want to dance, kick and the slap a friend  
The Addams family  
  
I remember the day I needed to borrow  
A little of pepper (for my chicken)  
The next thing you know, comin' at me  
Was a hand with the fingers high steppin' (I'm witcha)  
Now I tried to play it along (you know)  
And act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha)  
But what do I see (yo) a perm with feet (cousin it)  
Standin' about three feet tall (I'm outta here)  
  
They do what they want to do, say what they want to say  
Live how they want to live, play how they want to play  
Dance how they want to dance, kick and the slap a friend  
The Addams family  
  
Speakin' and thinkin' about the Addams  
You know the hammer is with it (I'm with it)  
Act a fool, no bones, swooop, goofy and randy  
You know we kick it (the posse)  
Now is the time to get in your mind  
It's okay to be yourself (be yourself)  
Take foolish pride and put it aside  
Like the Addams, yo! they def (that's a family!)  
  
They do what they want to do, say what they want to say  
Live how they want to live, play how they want to play  
Dance how they want to dance, kick and the slap a friend  
The Addams family
