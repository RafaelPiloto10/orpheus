A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see  
But like any other house it's only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If there's no love inside, it will soon fall apart  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing  
He who'd walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
Knows what it means to be a wealthy man  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Palaces will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
Worldly treasures will all pass away  
There's just one thing that was put here to stay  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love
