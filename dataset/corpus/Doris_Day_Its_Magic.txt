You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins  
It's magic  
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes  
It's magic  
Without a golden wand or mystic charms  
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms  
When we walk hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland  
It's magic  
How else can I explain those rainbows when there isn't rain?  
It's magic  
Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true  
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?  
It's magic  
It's magic  
Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true  
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?
