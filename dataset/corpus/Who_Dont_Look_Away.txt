Don't go and hide  
Yesterday you were my girlfriend  
If you do  
My inside goes around and around in a whirlwind  
  
There's a stone in my shoe  
So I can't catch you up  
My head's in a lion's mouth  
Wants to eat me up  
Right here today  
Don't look away  
I've always been true  
And I still love you  
So don't look away  
There's a lot you can do  
To get me away  
You've got to stay  
Don't look away  
Don't look away  
  
I once heard you say  
If I ever was down you would help me  
Now my head's being chewed up  
You pretend that you don't see  
  
There's a stone in my shoe  
So I can't catch you up  
My head's in a lion's mouth  
Wants to eat me up  
Right here today  
Don't look away  
I've always been true  
And I still love you  
So don't look away  
There's a lot you can do  
To get me away  
You've got to stay  
Don't look away  
Don't look away  
  
I've always been true  
And I still love you  
So don't look away  
There's a lot you can do  
To get me away  
You've got to stay  
Don't look away  
Don't look away  
Don't look away  
Don't look away  
Don't look away
