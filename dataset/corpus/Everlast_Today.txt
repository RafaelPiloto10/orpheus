Yesterday, just a dream I don't remember  
Tomorrow, still a hope I've yet to endure  
I'm out of time  
I'm out of rhyme  
I'm out of reason  
Season's change and leave me out in the cold  
The story's old  
The tale been told by many scholars  
Got a fistful of dollar  
And a pocketful of love  
God above if you hear me cryin'  
I've tried to sell my soul  
But no one's buyin'  
Lord, strike me down now if I'm lyin'  
It's gettin' cold  
It's time for dyin.  
  
Chorus  
Come on and watch me shine  
Like the world is mine (check it out) today  
Come on and watch me shine (check it out)  
Like the world is mine today  
Watch me shine (check it out)  
  
Let the man who's free from sin  
Cast the first stone and begin the violence  
Let the man whose words ring true  
Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence  
Let the ones who lose their way  
Live to see just one more day in the sunshine  
Let the ones who choose to stray  
Recognize the price they'll pay  
In their lifetime  
  
Chorus  
Come on and watch me shine  
Like the world is mine (check it out) today  
Come on and watch me shine (check it out)  
Like the world is mine today  
Watch me shine (check it out)  
  
Sittin here waitin' for my roads to cross  
You nail me down and you watch me bleed  
So lay my head against the earth  
Plant my body like a seed  
You can't always get the things you want, love (check it out)  
You get what you deserve  
Or maybe what you need  
So fill my hole with precious dirt, love  
Till the soil and part the weed  
  
Chorus  
Come on and watch me shine  
Like the world is mine (check it out) today  
Come on and watch me shine (check it out)  
Like the world is mine today  
Watch me shine (check it out)
