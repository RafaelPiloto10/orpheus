Darkest deep brown eyes I've seen  
Angel came into my dream  
Like the morning's early light  
You freshen all around  
And with all the love you bring unknown delight  
  
Sweetest innocence and free  
God has given you the key  
To the hearts of everyone  
That comes in sight of you  
And with all the love you bring unknown delight  
  
Who have eyes will clearly see  
And no one could disagree  
A treasure of the world  
A child, watching it grow  
And with all the love will bring unknown delight  
  
Repeat
