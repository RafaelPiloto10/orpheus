Yeah, I've been in debt, from conception  
And I'll pay for the rest of your life  
As long as I mail my bills and look me in the eye  
You can have it now, but you gotta pay for it later  
You work me up, I pay my plan  
Now you're working for the man, yeah  
Hey got you goin' in, they got you comin' out  
Same amount, in 'n' out  
There ain't no way 'round the system  
Money makes this world go 'round  
All the way, they got you down  
Sing and add it up, for throwing yourself out the window  
My conscience loves to stick around  
One more payment, lay it down, on the ground  
Same amount, in 'n' out  
Uh uh uhu yeah, uh uh uhu yeah, uh uh uhu yeah, ooh c'mon  
  
Hey it all depends how you see it  
It's a plan or an opportunity  
One thing for certain, you're gettin' nothin' free  
I never met a man doesn't owe somebody somethin', no  
No way to get free 'n' clear  
Only deeper, year after year, oh yeah,  
Well they got you comin' in, well they got you goin' out  
Got you comin' in, for the same amount, goin' out!  
Uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out)  
Uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out)  
Well they got you goin' in, they got you comin' out  
Same amount, in 'n' out  
Uh uh uhu (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu (in 'n' out)  
Uh uh uhu (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu (in 'n' out)  
Uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out)  
Uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out)  
Oh they got you comin' in, for the same amount  
Goin' out, in 'n' out  
Uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out)  
Uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out), uh uh uhu yeah (in 'n' out)...
