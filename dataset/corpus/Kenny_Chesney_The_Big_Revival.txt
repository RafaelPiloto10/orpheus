Get ready for the big revival  
Get ready for the big revival  
  
Get ready for the big revival  
Everybody get in the van  
There's a little church on Eagle Mountain  
It's called The Blood of the Blessed Land  
If your faith ain't strong enough, child, you might wind up dead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
Now Reverend Jones, he struts and dances  
While the guitar plays Amazing Grace  
He testifies in tongues of fire  
With tears of joy running down his face  
He ain't sure and we ain't sure exactly what he said  
But praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
[Bridge]  
You won't find many hypocrites that'll take the chance on getting bit  
(The big revival, the big revival, the big revival, the big revival)  
But a true believer can survive rattlesnakes and cyanide  
  
Now when you hold that deadly viper  
Keep the holy spirit in your mind  
Do not lose your concentration  
That serpent's surely bound to strike  
Either way you won't forget the first time that you said  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead
