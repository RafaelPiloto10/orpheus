The snow is falling It's Christmas Eve  
Presents are wrapped Under the tree  
Is there one for me?  
  
I only want you for Christmas, baby  
I don't need nothing else  
I only want you for Christmas, baby  
Tie a ribbon 'round yourself  
Oh, tie a ribbon 'round yourself

Cause what I'm wanting this year Saint Nick don't need to know  
  
I only want you for Christmas, baby

Tie a ribbon 'round yourself

And honey ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
