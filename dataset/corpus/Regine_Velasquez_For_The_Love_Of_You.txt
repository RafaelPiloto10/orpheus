Driftin' on a mem'ry  
Ain't no place I'd rather be  
Than with you, ooh yeah  
Lovin' you  
Day will make a way for night  
All we need is candelight  
And a song, ooh yeah  
Soft and slow  
Well .... oohhh  
Glad to be  
Here along with the lover like no other  
Sad to see  
Anew horizon slowly comin' into view  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin' is for the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
Lovely as a ray of sun  
That touches me when the morning comes  
Feels good to me ...  
My love, make  
Smoother than, than a gentle breez  
Flowing through my mind with ease  
Soft as can be  
When you're in love with me  
Love to be  
Ridingthe waves of your love  
Enchanted with your touch  
Seems to me we can sail together  
In and out of misery  
Oooohh  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin', givin'  
For the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
[RAP]  
Aha  
You're my lollipop  
You're my lemondrop  
You're my sweet pea  
You're my queen bee  
When i look into your eyes  
Like a ray of sunshine  
You're the kind of girl  
I wanna sport  
When I'm on a roller ride  
I'ts love I'm livin'  
All for you  
The first girl in my life  
That I'll always be true  
Some get jealous  
Of what we got  
But there's no way to stop  
All the feelings we got  
Just the little things  
That made me gig with you  
The way you look in my eyes  
The way you find the time  
The way you touch my hand  
When I'm not in demand  
The way you make me feel fine  
When I'm cryin' at night  
Paradise within my mind  
So i huff and I puff  
But you know I ain't trippin'  
I told you before that I'll only be livin'  
For the love of you, my boo  
I wanna be livin'  
For the love  
For the love of you girl  
All that I'm givin'  
Is for the love of you  
That's why everything I do  
I do for you  
Might as well  
Sign my name on a card  
That could say it better  
Time will tell  
Cause it seems that  
I've done just about  
All that I can do  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin' is for the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
You ... you ... you ...  
Givin' ...  
Oooh ooh ooh ooh  
Driftin' on a mem'ry  
I wanna livin for your love  
[SPOKEN]  
Hey Regine!  
What?  
What's up?  
What's up?  
Guess what?  
What?  
We're livin' for the love of you  
Ahahahah  
Is for the love of you
