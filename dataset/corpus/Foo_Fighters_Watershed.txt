Stick it to the mailman  
Reading is a problem  
See you all suntanned  
Only with the ray bans  
  
Take that to the man you call the chair  
Pissing on a wet wall  
  
Skinny yellow spit, man  
Dealin' with the shit, man  
Make it with my bad hand  
Just another rock band  
  
Take that to the man they call the chair  
Trouble with the contract  
  
Hey there, boy, you been catchin' the black widow  
That's what we want you to know  
  
I want to swim in a watershed  
I want to listen to crawdads  
I lost the counter so bad  
I keep on thinking I get ahead, I'm  
  
Pissin' on the disc jam  
Pissin' 'bout the farm hand  
Pissin' 'bout the Greek state  
Miss it and I can't wait  
  
Take that to the man they call the chair  
Trouble with the contract  
  
Hey, man, can't you tell  
It's still a problem?  
  
I want to swim in a wattershed  
I want to listen to crawdads  
I lost the counter so bad  
I keep on thinking I get ahead, I'm  
  
Pissin' on the disc jam  
Pissin' 'bout the farm hand  
Pissin' 'bout the greek state
