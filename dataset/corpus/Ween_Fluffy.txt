Fluffy, furry buddy  
Chewed his leg on the porch  
Why'd you do it Fluffy, on the porch?  
  
Good dog Fluffy, old friend my pal  
Fluffy's got his buddy on the porch  
Penny, she's my girlie, she sits here with me on the porch  
Penny looks so pretty on the porch  
  
Penny takes Fluffy for a walk out on the path  
Fluffy chases the other doggies on the path  
But big sister Penny get Fluffy back on the porch  
So me and Fluffy and Penny were on the porch
