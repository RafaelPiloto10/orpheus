Don't go  
There's so much left to tell you  
You just don't know how need you  
I never said how I cared  
Until now that you're leaving  
I can't hide what I'm feeling  
  
Please wait, there's so much left to tell you  
I never said how I loved you  
Oh, can't you stay one more day?  
And I'll try to show all of the love  
That I used to keep from you  
  
Words alone can't make you love me  
But how else am I to say to you  
That I know I will always want you?  
  
Help me, I can't stop myself crying  
Help me, 'cause I feel like I'm dying  
Please can't you stay with me?  
'Cause I can't live without you, my love  
  
Words alone can't make you love me  
But how else am I to say to you  
That I know I will always want you? Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
So, help me, I can't stop myself crying  
Help me 'cause I feel like I'm dying  
Please can't you stay with me?  
'Cause I can't live without you, my love
