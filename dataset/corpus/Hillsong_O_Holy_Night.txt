O Holy Night  
Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night divine.  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
  
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever  
His power and glory evermore proclaim  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night Divine
