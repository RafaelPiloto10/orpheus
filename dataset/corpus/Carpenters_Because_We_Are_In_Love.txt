Children, it was more fun to be children  
We just took life as it happened  
Run through the days, don't look behind  
Over wink of an eye and it's over  
What a surprise to discover  
We were people ourselves  
What kind of people did we want to be?  
No answer ever came to me  
I didn't sleep at all last night  
Mom, I've come to you like yesterday  
About today, mom, I'm afraid  
Hon, come and sit by my side  
Listen to me, words come so hard  
But what my heart says I will give you  
Because you are in love  
Your eyes begin to open  
As if you had awaken from a sleep  
Because you are in love  
You use imagination  
And lose your concentration  
When someone drops his name  
You're back in his arms as always  
Your day dreams work out that way  
It's all just a trick you mind plays  
The more love grows  
The more it says the same  
(Same little girl who's frightened)  
But I love him so  
(Same little girl who's sure)  
That she loves him so  
(Sees with a woman's vision)  
(Knows what a woman knows)  
Because we are in love  
We reach for our tomorrows  
And know we won't be lonely  
In laughter and in sorrows  
Where love abides  
There is the place we'll keep our hope forever  
You and I, because we are in love  
Because we won't be lonely  
In laughter and in sorrows  
When love abides  
There is the place we'll keep our home forever  
You and I, because we are in love
