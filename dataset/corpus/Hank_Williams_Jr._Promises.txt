I don't care if you never come home.  
I don't mind if you just  
Keep on rolling away on a distant sea,  
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me.  
  
You cause a commotion when you come to town.  
You give 'em a smile and they melt.  
And your lovers and friends is all good and fine.  
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine.  
La la la la la la la  
  
I don't care what you do late at night.  
No, and I don't care how you get your delights.  
I'll leave you alone,  
I'll just let you be.  
I don't love you and you don't love me.  
  
I got a problem, can you relate?  
I got a woman callin' love hate.  
We made a vow that we'd always be friends.  
How could we know that promises end?  
La la la la la la la  
  
I tried to love you for years upon years.  
You wouldn't take it for real.  
It's time you saw what I wanted you to see,  
And I'd still love you and you'd still love me.  
  
I got a problem, can you relate?  
I got a woman callin' love hate.  
Aw, we made a vow that we'd always be friends.  
How could we know that promises end?  
La la la la la la la  
  
La la la la la la la
