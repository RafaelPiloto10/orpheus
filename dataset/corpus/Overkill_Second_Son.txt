Damned at birth, the child king born.  
The prophets warned beware the second son.  
Born to lead! And then raised in peace and harmony  
My fellow man and I live as one.  
  
Together forever!  
Forever in the kingdom of the son!  
  
Watched in fear, another day the final year!  
The light that fills our sky begins to die.  
Haunted dreams.I sleep in terror wake in screams!  
The scent of burning flesh fills sacred skies.  
  
Skies filled with slaughter.  
And slaughter from the order in my mind!  
  
History unfolds as the prophets had fortold  
And lightning strikes, the fire fills my eyes.  
Hell hath claimed another soul now  
Watch the spirit die.  
  
Evil minds now rule my destiny!!!  
A Sinner by my side won't set me free.  
Thoughts of pain and power fill my veins.  
All fear my name!!!  
You were warned, of the child born  
Beware!  
  
Feel the fire! Expect no mercy!  
Olympus burns! Father forgive me!!!  
Know my wrath brother before me  
Beware
