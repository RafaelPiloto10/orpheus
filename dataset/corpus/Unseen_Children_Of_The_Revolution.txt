Father looks down to his son  
Says "I was like you when I was young"  
Son looks up to father's plans  
Works in the factory with his hands  
  
Says "I want to be just like you,  
Organize the work for the collective few"  
But as he grows up he sees no change  
Systems won't let you rearrange!  
  
Some day people will say  
"Do we have to live this way?"  
"Is this how we have to exist?"  
And the people will rise up, and resist!  
  
A majority class dominates  
A world that the lower class creates  
Media confusion hides the fact  
That we work with the rich man's knife in our back  
We're killing ourselves for a profit gain  
A profit off life what a fucking shame  
We burn that flag for the values sworn  
Some day we'll burn it to keep warm  
  
What we have done will not be lost  
To all eternity  
Everything ripens at its time  
And becomes fruit eventually!  
  
Children of the revolution
