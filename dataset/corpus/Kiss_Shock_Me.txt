Your lightnin's all I need  
My satisfaction grows  
You make me feel at ease  
You even make me glow  
Don't cut the power on me  
I'm feelin' low, so get me high  
  
Shock me, make me feel better  
Shock me, put on your black leather  
Shock me, we can come together  
  
And baby, if you do what you've been told  
My insulation's gone, girl you make me overload  
  
Don't pull the plug on me, no, no  
Keep it in and keep me high  
  
Shock me, make me feel better  
Shock me, put on your black leather  
Shock me, we can come together  
Come on  
  
Shock me, baby, shock me, oh yeah  
Shock me, baby, shock me, oh yeah  
  
Shock me, make me feel better, oh yeah  
Come on and shock me, put on your black leather  
Baby, I'm down to the bare wire  
Shock me, we can come together  
Oh yeah, I wanna feel your power  
Shock me, make me feel better  
Baby, I'm down to the bare wire  
Shock me, put on your black leather  
Baby, come on, come on, shock me
