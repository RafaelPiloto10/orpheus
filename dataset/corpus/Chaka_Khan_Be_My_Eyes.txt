Big brown bedroom eyes  
They're bad for me  
Reluctantly you hit me  
To my vulnerability  
I don't like this feeling  
'Cause I can't see straight  
Something says I met my match  
Courtesy of fate  
  
I've always taken pride  
In my independence  
So afraid and careful  
Not to show it  
No - but you give me clarity  
Like a bright green laser beam  
I think you want what's best for me  
In spite of my resistance  
  
Be my eyes  
Sing me, I'm your song  
Make me wise, baby  
I'll be strong  
  
Constantly the ones we love scorn us  
It's not for them to comprehend  
It's none of their business  
Misery loves company  
  
I think you really know me  
And there's no coincidence  
My mama must have made me  
So we would find each other
