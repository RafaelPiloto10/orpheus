When I was one, till I was three  
My mom and dad took care of me  
Now I'm four and the world's alive  
And I just can't wait until I'm five.  
  
I just can't wait until I'm five.  
  
When I am six there is a rule  
Kids like me all start to school  
Somewhere between seven and eight  
I'll start to grow and I just can't wait.  
  
I'll start to grow and I just can't wait.  
  
Nine is weird as it can be  
My brother's nine and he picks on me  
But I just can't wait until I'm ten  
I'll be completely grown by then.  
  
I'll be completely grown by then
