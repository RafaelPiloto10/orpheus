[Chorus:]  
More than a ripple, less than a splash  
The heir to a long line of glory  
Give me the moment and I'll give you a song  
It's so good bein' part of the story  
This moment in time  
This right time of day  
Oh, I love bein' with you and watchin' my life at play  
  
My love in your eyes  
Is lightin' my dreams  
And the feelin's you choose  
Have touches of blues and greens  
  
This trip into time  
This timeless embrace  
I'm like a kid in a store, I'll always want more to taste  
  
And no matter what comes I know the sun is gonna shine  
Because of you and me, there'll be this moment in time  
  
And no matter what comes I know the sun is gonna shine  
Because of you and me, there'll be this moment in time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And no matter what comes I know the sun is gonna shine  
Because of you and me, there'll be this moment in time  
  
La, la, la, la, la ...
