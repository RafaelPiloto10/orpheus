(Do or Die)  
Yo Kanye Blow the Hook you a genius boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now when you hear this song you know it's on (Babygirl)  
When you hear this song you know it's on  
When you hear this song you know it's on  
I swear your lovin got me so high I'm gone  
  
Me and you babygirl like best friends  
Let me hit you when I get the notion  
On I-55 you and I  
Let's ride hit the motion  
Some say she freaky freaky  
Let me guess your lidro needa  
I'm hittin through the back and curves  
Hell, they sell the herb  
  
Now open up your mind to this concept  
Then you take one step  
Straight from the feelin of a wordsmith  
That's the herb shit  
Up on my 22 spins  
In my baby blue benz  
Girls say dat boys ben actin up  
But that's the way he is  
  
You lookin good when you steppin out a centerfold  
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold  
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game  
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it  
So now let me sugarcoat it  
It's like I'm on that tight herb  
And when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like  
  
Your my latest, and my geatest  
My latest, my greatest  
(Chorus)(x2)  
  
When I'm layin in the back of my 745  
With my lips on you  
Spittin good game  
With the hustler grain  
Gettin brained like a hustler should  
Hustler would  
And you know when I hear the stuff  
I'm still tryin to hear this love what that do  
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you jus got me sprung  
What that do  
  
Oh yes she's one of the best  
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin  
Lurkin searchin for the virgin  
But when my babygurl it's workin  
Let me know whats that you smokin  
From the hands as I stick my tounge in  
Then from the back but she want an autograph  
But still we sexin'  
  
Open back up last time  
As I spit a little dough in my mind  
She jus like one of a kind  
No c's no stand in her hind  
Shes jus like me rappin a line  
Perfect let me drop in a dime  
I'm on a roll again  
I'm bought to blow again  
  
Your my latest, and my geatest  
My latest, my greatest  
[Chorus:]  
  
Just keep on liftin me up yeah  
  
(Choir)  
Higher  
(Do or Die and Kanye)  
No need to take another puff  
(Choir)  
Higher  
(Do or Die and Kanye)  
Cause your love has got me high enough  
No, No, No, No, No, No  
(overlappig Choir and Do or die)  
Just keep on Lifting me up yeah  
  
(Choir)  
Higher  
(Do or Die and Kanye)  
No need to take another puff  
(Choir)  
Higher

Cause your love has got me high enough  
No, No, No, No, No, No

Just keep on Lifting me up yeah
