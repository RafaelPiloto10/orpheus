Well that mean old dirty Frisco  
And that low down Santa Fe.  
Mean old Frisco  
And that low down Santa Fe.  
You know they take my girl away,  
Lord, and blow back out on me.  
  
Well my mama, she done told me,  
And my papa told me too.  
Mama told me  
And my papa told me too.  
A woman that gets in your face,  
Lord she ain't no friend for you.  
  
Well I'm going away now baby  
And I won't be back until fall.  
Going away, baby.  
Lord, I won't be back till fall.  
If I don't come back by then,  
Lord, I won't be back at all.  
  
Well I'm going away baby  
And your crying won't make me stay.  
Going away baby  
And your crying won't make me stay.  
Well the more you cry, little girl,  
If anything you'll drive me away.  
  
Well that mean old dirty Frisco  
And that low down Santa Fe.  
Mean old Frisco  
And that low down Santa Fe.  
Gonna take my gal away,  
Lord, and blow back out on me.
