Most of the time  
I'm advising my friends  
About what's wrong or right  
When they call me at night  
  
Now I'm confused,  
Cause my mind says I'm a fool  
That it's time to say goodbye  
But my tears cannot lie  
And my heart says I will lose if I try...  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would say I'd give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love, was never meant for you and me  
  
I'm trying real hard  
Cause I know that a friend is something you can't be  
Our love is too deep  
Or is this our fate  
Just a never ending battle no one else can see  
I refuse to give in  
But I'm afraid to start something we can't win  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would say I'd give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love, was never meant for you and me  
  
Love is magic  
Love is irresistible  
But love is fearless and not able to see  
Love is gorgeous  
Love is unpredictable  
But love is brainless and sometimes so are we...  
  
What if I would sacrifice my life for you  
What if I would I'd give up my dreams too  
What if you were meant to be my destiny  
But what if love, was never meant for you and me  
  
And our love was never meant for you and me  
No our love was never meant for you and me
