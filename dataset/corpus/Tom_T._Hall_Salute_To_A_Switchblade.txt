Me and Yates an army buddy o'mine were doin' three years in Germany at the
time  
We came upon these Frauleins in the bar  
Yates said darf isch zee be-gleit-en they said ya  
(And darf isch zee be-gleit-en means can we sit with you all)  
  
Oh we must have drunk ten quarts of German beer  
My conscience and my sinuses were clear  
I asked that Fraulein if she was a spy she said nein but do bis ain bissel
high  
(A condition not uncommon to the American soldier)  
  
Well later on I went to be excused when I returned I was a bit confused  
Yates and his Fraulein had hit the air another guy was sittin' in my chair  
(A young soldier whom we shall get to know better)  
I said excuse me Mister that's my seat I'd like to have it back sir if you
please  
  
That girl's a nurse and I've been awful sick the man looked up at me and said
mox-nix  
(Which means that he was not overly concerned with my health)  
Next thing I knew he had a switchblade knife  
Lord I didn't know that Fraulein was his wife  
  
I took off through that Gasthaus like a fool behind me I heard the crashing
stools  
(As the police would say he was in hot pursuit)  
Well the waitress yelled there's MPs on the way  
That's one more reason I didn't want to stay  
  
As I went out the window somethin' went switch  
And I giggled all the way home knowin' he missed  
(At the time it seemed like a laughing matter)  
But next morning my coat was lyin' there on the bunk  
  
And when I saw that coat it made me jump  
That man had cut my coat right down the back  
A little bit more and they'd been playin' me taps  
(And knowin' the sad nature of that song I would decline it)  
  
Well later on I heard that guy got stabbed  
They sent him home and didn't that make me glad  
On love and marriage I want to say one thing oh lady if you're married wear
that ring  
  
(And the army has a new policy if you can't move it paint it  
If it has a switchblade knife salute it  
Not necessarily an incident one would want to write Mother about  
Germany being full of good soldiers good people)
