The only light inside this tomb  
Is coming from so high above us  
Watching through a tiny window,  
the moon is looking on  
  
Down on your knees, down if you please  
While I blindfold your eyes  
The two of us are gonna play a little game  
I think that I will call it  
  
Trick or treat, let us go hide and seek  
Follow me into the night  
Where the sun don't shine but the moon is bright  
  
Lucy is sleeping...in one of seven graves  
Now you decide, which ones are trick or treat  
  
Trick or treat, let us go hide and seek  
I can only let you fail this twice  
The third time you must be right  
  
Lucy is sleeping...in one of seven graves  
Now you decide, which ones are trick or treat  
  
You better start digging  
She could be dying while we speak  
You better start digging  
Before the worms have their feast  
  
How does it feel, to be digging for someone you love  
How does it feel...to be digging for LOVE ?  
  
Ohhhhh No No No, you failed again  
That's not Lucy...that's someone else you've got  
You blindfolded creep  
  
I'm beginning to get the feel that you're  
Digging your own grave  
  
Lucy is sleeping...in one of seven graves  
Only one left chance, to save your daughter  
  
You better start digging  
She could be dying while we speak  
You better start digging  
Before the worms have their feast  
  
The only light inside this graveyard  
Is coming from so high above us  
Watching from the blackened sky,  
the moon is looking on  
  
Down on your knees, dig if you please  
While I blindfold your brain  
  
One blow to the back of the head and  
He is face down, down in Lucy's grave  
  
Lucy is sleeping...in one of seven graves  
Her Daddy won...but I am winning now  
  
I'm dragging him back, back to the tomb  
I'm dragging him back, and I'm tying him down
