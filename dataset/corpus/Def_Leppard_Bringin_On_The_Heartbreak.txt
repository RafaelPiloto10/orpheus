Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty  
The broken rose with laughin' eyes  
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild  
Like a child without a home  
You're always searching, searching for a feeling  
That it's easy come and easy go  
  
Oh I'm sorry but it's true  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Takin' all the best of me  
Oh can't you see?  
You got the best of me  
Whoa can't you see?  
  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
Can't you see?  
  
Oh whoa  
You're such a secret, misty eyed and shady  
Lady how you hold the key  
Oh you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin'  
Burnin' out and burnin' me  
  
Can't you see?  
Just try and say to you  
  
You're bringin' on the heartache  
Takin' all the best of me  
Oh can't you see?  
You got the best of me  
Whoah can't you see?  
  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
  
Can't you see?  
Can't you see?  
No no no  
You got the best of me  
Oh can't you see?  
You got the best of me  
Whoah can't you see?  
  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
