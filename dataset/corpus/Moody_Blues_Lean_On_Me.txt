Lean on me  
I'll be there  
Whenever you need someone  
To share in every prayer  
In every dream  
You've left somewhere  
'till tomorrow  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Cause tonight  
I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
  
Lean on me  
I'm every where  
Where ever you look i'll be  
Forever yours  
The northern lights  
The southern cross  
I'll give to you  
'till tomorrow  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Cause tonight  
I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
  
If you're lonely  
You know where you can find me  
You know there's no escape when you are on your own  
And if you're worried  
And you can see your world slip through your fingers  
I'll reach out for you in my heart  
There's no more dancing in the dark  
  
You're not alone  
Tomorrow  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Cause tonight  
I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Tonight I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
Will be just like it was when we were young
