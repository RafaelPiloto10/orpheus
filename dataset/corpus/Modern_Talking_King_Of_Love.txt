Thomas Anders's single  
  
Took a plane straight away from Las Vegas to you.  
Entertain and enchant, that's what I'm gonna do.  
It's burning like fire, it's dancers delight  
Takes you higher and higher and higher tonight.  
  
Chor:  
Cause when I look into your eyes  
You will be captured and mesmerized  
  
Take your chances  
  
Chor:  
Come on and feel the magic groove,  
The rhythm's gonne make you move  
For tonight  
  
L.O.V.E. - Heart attack  
I'm gonna bring you the feeling back  
L.O.V.E.- Girls be tough  
Baby, I've got what you need, cause I'm the KING OF LOVE  
  
Do you belong to someone else or will you stay for tonight?  
Is there someone in your life or can you go for a ride..?  
Tell me, how does it feel when you're touched by a KING?  
Oh your heart will be burning when I'm starting to sing.  
  
Chor:  
Cause when I look into your eyes  
You will be captured and mesmerized  
  
Take your chances  
  
Chor:  
Come on and feel the magic groove,  
The rhythm's gonne make you move  
For tonight  
  
L.O.V.E. - Heart attack  
I'm gonna bring you the feeling back  
L.O.V.E.- Girls be tough  
Baby, I've got what you need, cause I'm the KING OF LOVE
