All the way from across the sea  
From man to you, from the man to me  
Four white sticks with good intentions  
Feed the flame  
For my protection  
  
I want to know what you want  
To find what I don't  
But now it's yesterday  
  
Falling down a broken spiral  
Head the flame for no tomorrow  
Back up on your feet again  
Hole my hand, I'll be your friend  
  
The leaves are falling  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down again
