Like an angel fly over your house  
Like an angel pass out wishes  
Like an angel I will move the arrow  
Like an angel I live alone  
I'm not livin' what was promised  
I am close but can't enjoy  
Oh I'm not dyin'  
Oh I'm so tortured 'cause I see all  
Tortured and all I cannot do  
Tortured all I should have done  
Tortured while I occupied a man  
I'm not livin' what was promised  
I am far from glorified  
Oh I'm not dyin'  
Oh I'm not alone  
Mind is not a celestial state with idle hymns of praise  
Time is short I have an appointment at noon at noon in Hell  
Across the waste of space and fields of air I glide alone at night  
Oh please please think of me 'cause I'm I'm by your side  
I'm by your side I'm by your side oh  
I'm I'm right in front of you I'm by your side
