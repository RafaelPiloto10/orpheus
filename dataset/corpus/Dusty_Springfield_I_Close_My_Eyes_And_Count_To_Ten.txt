It isn't the way that you look  
And it isn't the way that you talk  
It isn't the things that you say or do  
Make me want you so  
  
It is nothing to do with the wine  
Or the music that's flooding my mind  
But never before have I been so sure  
You're the someone I dreamed I would find  
  
It's the way you make me feel  
The moment I am close to you  
It's a feeling so unreal  
Somehow I can't believe it's true  
The pounding I feel in my heart  
The hoping that we'll never part  
I can't believe this is really happening to me  
  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here  
I close my eyes and count again  
I can't believe it but you're still here  
  
We were strangers a moment ago  
With a few dreams but nothing to show  
The world was a place  
With a frown on its face  
And tomorrow was just, I don't know  
  
But the way you make me feel  
The moment I am close to you  
Makes today seem so unreal  
Somehow I can't believe it's true  
Tomorrow will you still be here?  
Tomorrow will come but I fear  
That what is happening to me  
Is only a dream  
  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here  
I close my eyes and count again  
I can't believe it but you're still here  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here
