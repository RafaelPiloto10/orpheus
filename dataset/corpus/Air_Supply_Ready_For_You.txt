Painted sands and makeshift hands take us round and round  
Horizon clear, you'll soon be near and walking on the ground  
I've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight  
If you sail across the border, we can float into the night  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
  
Cloudy Sky, the wind is high and trying to break the spell  
But I'll be here when you appear I'll see the nijtht as well  
A feeling's not a feeling if you can't believe it's true  
I'd sooner be believing 'til the ship comes sailing through'  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
  
I've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight  
If you sail across the border, we can float into the night  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you
