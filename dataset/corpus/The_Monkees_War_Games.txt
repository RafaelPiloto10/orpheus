Did you buy your tickets for the war game?  
Aren't you glad that your sitting in the back?  
For the game is deadly having all the players  
Aren't you glad it's a spectator sport  
  
Can't you hear the cries?  
It isn't over  
Can't you smell the fear?  
It's all over  
  
If you want to play the game, you must have playmates  
Choose your side play guitar (???) but play to win  
Don't be sad if you loose it it isn't over  
Pick your side and begin the game agian  
It isn't over  
  
Can't you hear the cries?  
It isn't over  
Can't you smell the fear?  
It's all over  
  
You don't have to play the game if you don't want to  
You can sit at home and hear it on the news  
They will show you colored pictures of the killings  
They want you to feel that you're part of it too.  
  
Can't you hear the cries?  
It isn't over  
Don't you smell the fear?  
It's all over  
It's all over
