My funny valentine  
Sweet, comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable  
Yet your my favorite work of art  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak,  
Are you smart?  
But don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine  
Stay  
Each day is valentine's day  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak,  
Are you smart?  
But don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine  
Stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day
