Even the old folks never knew  
Why they call it like they do  
I was wondering since the age of two  
Down on Copperline  
Copper head, copper beech  
Copper kettles sitting side by each  
Copper coil, cup o'Georgia peach  
Down on Copperline  
Half a mile down to Morgan Creek  
Leaning heavy on the end of the week  
Hercules and a hog-nosed snake  
Down on Copperline  
We were down on Copperline  
  
One Summer night on the Copperline  
Slip away past supper time  
Wood smoke and moonshine  
Down on Copperline  
One time I saw my daddy dance  
Watched him moving like a man in a trance  
He brought it back from the war in France  
Down onto Copperline  
Branch water and tomato wine  
Creosote and turpentine  
Sour mash and new moon shine  
Down on Copperline  
Down on Copperline  
  
First kiss ever I took  
Like a page from a romance book  
The sky opened and the earth shook  
Down on Copperline  
Down on Copperline  
Took a fall from a windy height  
I only knew how to hold on tight  
And pray for love enough to last all night  
Down on Copperline  
Day breaks and the boys wakes up  
And the dog barks and the birds sings  
And the sap rises and the angels sigh, yeah  
  
I tried to go back, as if I could  
All spec house and plywood  
Tore up and tore up good  
Down on Copperline  
It doesn't come as a surprise to me  
It doesn't touch my memory  
Man I'm lifting up and rising free  
Down on over Copperline  
Half a mile down to Morgan Creek  
I'm only living for the end of the week  
Hercules and a hog-nosed snake  
Down on Copperline, yeah  
Take me down on Copperline  
Oh, down on Copperline  
Take me down on Copperline
