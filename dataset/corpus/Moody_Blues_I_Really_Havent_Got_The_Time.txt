You want me to ride  
In your car outside  
Spend some time with you  
Just an hour or two  
But I really,  
I really haven't  
I really haven't got the time  
I really  
I really haven't  
I really haven't got the time  
I really haven't got the time  
I'm a busy man  
Workin' when I can  
I got no time to lend  
I got no time, time to spend  
Oh no, I really  
I really haven't  
I really haven't got the time  
Oh no, I really

I really haven't got the time  
Oh no, I really

Workin' nine 'til five  
Got to stay alive (I've got to stay alive)  
Find somebody who (Go find somebody who)  
Got some time for you (Who's got the time for you)  
But I really
