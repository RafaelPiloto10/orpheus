I'm a new pair of eyes  
Every time I am born  
An original mind  
Because I just died  
  
And I'm scanning the horizon for someone recognizing  
That I might have been queen  
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning  
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation  
  
Let the waters rise  
I've ridden each tide  
From the gates of the city  
Where the first born died  
  
And I might have been queen  
I remember the girl in the fields with no name  
She had a love  
Oh but the river won't stop for me  
No the river won't stop for me  
  
I'm a new pair of eyes  
An original mind  
With my senses of old  
And the heart of a giant  
  
And I'm searching through the wreckage  
For some great recollection  
That I might have been queen  
  
For every sage that falls  
There's an ancient child  
  
And I might have been queen  
I remember the girl in the fields with no name  
She had a love  
Oh but the river won't stop for me  
No the river won't stop for me  
  
I look up to the stars with my perfect memory  
I lived through it all, and my future's no shock to me  
I look down, but I see no tragedy  
I look up to my past, my spirit running free  
I look down, I look down, and I'm there in history  
Oh I'm a soul survivor  
  
(Soul survivor on the river, but it won't stop)  
I might have been queen!  
(Soul survivor on the river, but it won't stop)  
I know the secret combination
