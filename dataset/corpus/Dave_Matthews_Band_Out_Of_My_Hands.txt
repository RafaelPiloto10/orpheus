Out on the window ledge I don't feel safe,  
And I stayed looking down you  
  
It's out of my hands for now  
It's out of my hands for now  
I can't just walk away  
It'd be nice to walk away  
But I don't feel safe  
Get away, all the way up here  
  
It's out of my hands for now  
It's out of my hands for now  
Oh it is down from here  
And down from here  
  
Start to feel insane, betrayed  
Out on my window ledge  
  
And now our finest hour arrives,  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
And all the believers stand behind him and smile  
As the day lights up with fire  
Let me in  
Let me in  
I stopped feeling crazy, betrayed  
Out on my window ledge  
  
And now our finest hour arrives,  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
And all the believers stand behind him and smile  
Watch the day lights up in fire  
Lookin' down from here  
  
It's out of my hands for now  
Out on my window ledge  
It's out of my hands for now  
So let me in  
Let me in
