Well I never did crawl and I never did toe the line  
No man is a master to me, I ain't that kind  
I just put on my travelin' shoes  
If you want to win you just can't lose the time  
Or stay behind  
  
Well I was born to run  
To get ahead of the rest  
And all that I wanted was to be the best  
Just to feel free and be someone  
I was born to be fast I was born to run  
  
Well I take the chances for the time I made mistakes  
But you don't get nothin' unless you take the breaks  
Livin' as dangerous as dynamite  
Sure it makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel  
Alright  
Makes you feel alright  
  
Nobody gonna make me do things their way  
By the time you figure it out it's yesterday  
Well it comes to he who waits I'm told  
But I don't need it when I'm old and gray  
Yeah, I want it today
