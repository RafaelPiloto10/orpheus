Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
  
Fe, fe, fi, fi, for, for, fum  
Look at Molly now, here she come  
Wearin' a wig, hat, shades to match  
High healed sneakers and an aligator hat  
Wearin' her diamons, wearin' a big ring  
She got rasors on her fingers and everything  
  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
  
Wearin' her perfume, Chanel number five  
Got to be the finest looking woman alive  
She looks so pretty every time she walks by  
The boys are too nervous, even to say hi  
Not too skinny, not too fat  
She's a real humdinger and I like it like that  
  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
  
Good golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
Good golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and rollin'  
Don't you hear your mama call  
  
From the early, early morning to the early, early night  
See Miss Molly rockin' in the house of blue light  
  
Good golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and rollin'  
Don't you hear your mama call  
  
Well c., C. C. Rider  
Come on see just what you've done  
Well I said c., C. C. Rider  
Come on see just what you've done  
You made me loving you  
And now, now, now your man has come  
  
Well now I'm goin' C. C. Rider  
Goin' to see my baby C. C. Rider  
And I won't be back C. C. Rider
