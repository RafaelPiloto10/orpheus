Hey, hey, hey, sweet thing  
I give in  
Sweet thing  
I give in (submission)  
(don't you want to right it, fight it)  
Oh, no, if you don't think it's right  
Can't change your mind if I talk all night  
(don't you want to right it, fight it)  
Oh, no, 'cause nothing now can keep this a good thing.

Sweet thing  
I give in (submission)

Just go.  
I don't want to fight  
Just take your things  
And say goodnight  
(don't you want to right it, fight it)  
Just go.  
'cause nothing now can keep this a good thing.  
  
Hey, hey, hey how could you be so unkind  
When you were lying to me all the time  
You don't need me now your life is fine  
It's your day now, but it's gonna be mine  
Oh and what a sweet day.
