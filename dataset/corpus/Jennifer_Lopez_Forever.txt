You could stop the clock  
That wouldn't be time enough  
You could let the night turn to morning  
I still would be wantin more of your love  
There just ain't enough  
Days in a week  
Weeks in a month  
Months in a year  
How can I make it clear  
  
[[Pre-Chorus]]  
I wanna be with you  
And feel the heat with you  
I'm flyin  
I'm weightless  
I'm floating in the distance  
Don't rush it  
Be patient  
I'm gonna stop the hands of time  
I will  
  
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me  
If it feels like this its gotta be right  
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me  
Don't let it be over tonight  
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me  
If it feels like this its gotta be right  
Lets do it forever  
We could do it forever  
I could do this forever  
I could do this forever  
  
[[Chorus]]  
Give me all your life  
And I'd ask you for even more  
You cant offer me a part of your body  
Cuz honestly its just not enough anymore  
Lets get lost in the moment  
You know you want it  
What you waitin for  
  
[[Pre-Chorus]]  
  
[[Chorus]]  
  
Can you tell me what it is you're waiting for  
Can you tell me what it is cuz I dont know  
[Lets go]  
Come on baby just take my hand  
[Lets go]  
Why you lookin like you don't understand  
[Lets go]  
Thats it Imma make this easy  
[Lets go]  
And letting me believe me  
But Just  
  
[[Chorus]]
