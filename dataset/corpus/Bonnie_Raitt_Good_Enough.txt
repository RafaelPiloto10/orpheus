The first time I brought you home  
My mama said he ain't good enough  
I don't want my girl to be alone  
But I wonder is he good enough  
I-I-I was doin some worryin' too  
And I was thinkin' thinkin'  
Am I good enough for you  
  
The first time that I loved you  
I know it was a little rough  
But when at last we were still  
You asked was it good enough  
And I cried and looked in your eyes of blue  
Cause I been prayin' prayin'  
I was good enough for you  
Good enough for you  
  
Now I got to set your mind at ease  
Got to stop your insecurities  
Cause if anything  
You're too good for me  
  
Now it's strange how time's gone by  
Since the day that we fell in love  
And still some times we hafta ask ourselves  
Was it good enough  
And time is bound to make us see  
Just how good  
Good enough can be  
Good enough can be  
Good enough for you baby  
Good enough for me  
  
Now, It won't be long  
Good enough for me  
Keep me warm, baby  
For me  
Good enough for me
