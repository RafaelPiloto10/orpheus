Sitting in the corner of a room, thinkin' of you.  
Wonderin' what you're doing now we're apart.  
No use cryin', tears can't reach you now.  
Memories, fulfilling dreams.  
  
You used to be, so good to me,  
I can't live without you.  
I'd like to be, in your fantasy baby,  
Part of you is me, wo-  
  
Walking across the clouds, hope I see you there.  
Be it day or nighttime, I don't really care.  
Hope you see me too, before I meet my end.  
Someone stole my life away, I can't pretend.  
  
(chorus)
