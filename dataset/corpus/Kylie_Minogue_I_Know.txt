I feel the rush, rush  
Are we coming to the edge of a waterfall?  
Is it your touch, touch?  
I can see it in your eyes that you want it all  
  
Can I give you everything that you'll ever need?  
Ooh forever starts right now  
Like a wind at a sail driving on a sea  
Only you can show me how  
  
Chorus:  
You can tell me now  
That I'll never come down  
I know, I know  
You can show me light  
When we sleep at night  
I know, I know  
This river runs deep  
And the moon glides by  
And the mountains lay wet with snow  
And your love comes back like a faithful tide  
Teaching everything I know  
  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
  
Is it too much, much?  
Because it's written in the skies who we really are  
Am I in love, love?  
Deeper is the dark brighter shining stars  
  
Can we be everything that we wanna be?  
Ooh never let this die  
Feel the wave of your kiss washing over me  
Only you can get me high  
  
Chorus  
  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
Woh-ooh Woh-ooh-oh-oh  
  
X4:  
Do-do-do-do  
Do-do-do-do  
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
