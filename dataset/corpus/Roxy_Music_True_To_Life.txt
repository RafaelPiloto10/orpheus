So it gets to seven  
And I think of nothing  
But living in darkness  
And the diamond lady  
Well she's not telling  
I don't even know her name  
  
It's amazing  
Times have changed  
In days of old  
Imagination'd leave you standing  
Out in the could  
Dancing city  
Now you're talking  
  
But where's your soul  
You've a thousand faces  
I'll never know  
There are complications  
And compensations  
If you know the game  
Agitated in Xenon nightly  
I'll take you home again  
  
Travel way downtown  
In search of nothing  
But the sky at night  
And the diamond lady  
Well she's not talking  
But that's alright  
So I turn the pages  
And tell the story  
From town to town  
  
People tell me  
Be determined  
Poor country boy  
Too much luck  
Means too much trouble  
Much time alone  
But arm in arm  
With my seaside diamond  
I'll soon be home
