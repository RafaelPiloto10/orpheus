What does this ship bring to me  
Far across the restless sea  
Waiting for the sirens' call  
I've never seen it here before  
  
There she plies a lonely trade  
Cutting through the breaking waves  
Drifting slowly from her course  
She is lost forever more  
  
We all want some kind of love  
But sometimes it's not enough  
To the wall and through the door  
With a stranger on the shore  
  
I won't desert you  
I don't know what to say  
I really hurt you  
I nearly gave it all away  
  
I've got it all wrong  
Cause you were not the wrong one  
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone  
When you're gone  
  
Gotta catch the midnight train  
First to Paris then to Spain  
Travel with a document  
All across the continent  
  
City life is flying by  
The wheels are turning all the while  
Get on board we can't be late  
Our destination cannot wait  
  
All the stars and all the worlds  
Filling up this universe  
Could never be as close as us  
Will never shine as bright on us  
  
I won't desert you  
I don't know what to say  
I really hurt you  
I nearly gave it all away  
  
I've got it all wrong  
Cause you were not the wrong one  
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone  
When you're gone  
  
I won't desert you  
I don't know what to say  
I really hurt you  
I nearly gave it all away  
  
I've got it all wrong  
Cause you were not the wrong one  
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone  
  
How many times must I lose my way, hey  
How many words do I have to say, hey  
What can I do just to make you see  
That you're so good for a man like  
A man like me
