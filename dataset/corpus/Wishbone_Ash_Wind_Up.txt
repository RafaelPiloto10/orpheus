I got home about three a.m.,  
Working my fingers to the bone.  
My woman's waiting up for me,  
Gonna put me through the third degree.  
"where you been? who you seen? "  
Is all she wants to know.  
I can't lie to save my life  
'cause I got nothin' to hide.  
Let me tell you what's been on my mind.  
You been in the city again.  
I ain't lyin', baby, I saw you on your high horse,  
Walkin' along like you didn't belong  
To any self-respecting man.  
Is that the way you're gonna repay  
All the love that I've given to you?  
It's a wind-up, wind-up,  
Wind up accusin' me. (repeat)  
Wind me up.  
Maybe we should start all over again -  
That's the best advice.  
Meet me halfway, and I'll be there -  
I been there so long, and now I'm coming home for rest.  
I'm ok, how about you?  
Everything I said, baby, was true.  
We only got ourselves to blame -  
Makin' our bed is just a part of the game.  
It's a wind-up, wind-up,  
Wind up accusin' me.  
Baby, it's a wind-up, wind-up,  
Wind-up for you and me. (repeat)  
You want me, you want me to be.  
You gotta stop what you do.  
Wind-up, wind-up,  
I don't need no more of your lies.  
Wind-up, wind-up.  
I gotta stop now.  
Wind-up, wind-up.
