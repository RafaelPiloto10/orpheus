Lie in this empty bed  
With this aching head  
You left me here this morning  
Now I can't remember why  
I let you in again  
To get under my skin  
And every time you disappear  
Then I remember...  
  
How I look for you  
But I can't see your face  
And then I hear you  
The only thing you say...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am afraid right now  
I don't wanna let you down  
And I'm the one who can't be saved  
The only thing I say  
I am afraid right now  
What if I can't get out?  
What if I don't want to be saved?  
This is me afraid  
  
Now, there's no place like home  
To make me feel alone  
I see you everywhere I am, and I remember  
How you ran out to hide  
You kept me close behind  
Following your every move so I remember  
  
I look for you  
But I can't see your face  
And then I hear you  
The only thing you say...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I look for you  
But I can't see your face  
Then I hear you  
The only thing you say is  
Don't look for me  
'Cause you will never say  
You won't hear me  
You won't hear me  
  
Why do we keep this up?  
Why do we live like us?  
When there is nothing left to save  
Will you be afraid?  
  
I am afraid right now  
You already let me down  
You are the one who can't be saved  
If only I could say  
I am afraid right now  
You never will get out  
You'll never let yourself be saved  
You are so afraid  
You are so afraid
