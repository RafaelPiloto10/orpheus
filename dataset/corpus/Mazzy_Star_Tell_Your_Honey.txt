Tell your honey  
Living all alone  
?  
I guess I'll always be  
I guess I fear  
Go and tell your honey  
Can help from what I've seen  
I don't feel true  
Do you anyway  
I can see you sometimes  
And then I just don't care  
She loves (loathes?) me  
She loves (loathes?) me  
I don't think I could ever see  
Tell me that you're near  
So free that I'm leaving you behind  
Don't plan to let you say you're sorry  
Indeed so  
Or maybe you'll be high  
Be high x3  
Shiver in a bath  
I feel nice  
And see the light
