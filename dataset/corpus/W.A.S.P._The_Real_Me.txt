I went back to the doctor to get another shrink  
I sit and tell him about my weekend  
But he never can change what he thinks  
Can you see the real me, doctor, doctor  
Can you see the real me, doctor, ooh doctor  
  
I went back to my mother, I said I'm crazy Ma, help me  
She said "I know how it feels son, cause it runs in the family"  
see'mon tell me  
Can you see the real me, mother, mother  
Can you see the real me, mother, woah mother  
  
Can you see, can you see, can you see the real me  
Can you see, can you see the real me  
The real me, the real me, the real me  
  
The cracks between the pavement stones  
Like rivers of flowing rain  
Strange people who know me  
From behind every window pane  
The girl I used to love lives in this yellow house  
Yesterday she passed me by, she don't want to know me now  
  
Can you see the real me, can ya, can ya  
Can you see the real me, woah yea  
  
I ended up with the preacher, full of lies and hate  
I seemed to scare him a little, ha ha  
So he showed me to the golden gate  
Can you see the real me preacher, preacher  
Can you see the real me woah yea  
Can you see, can you see, can you see, woah yeah  
Can you see the real me, doctor, doctor  
Can you see the real me, mama  
Can you see the real me me me me
