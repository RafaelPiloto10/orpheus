All along I had to talk about it  
But like a two edged sword,  
He touched you and it stabs  
  
All along I knew you were  
A phony girl  
You sit behind the mask  
And you control your world  
  
You sit around and I watch your face  
I try to find the truth but that's your hiding place  
You say you love me but its hard to see  
Cause when he's in your arms,  
Your throwing rocks at me  
Who do you love?  
Is it me?  
Well, I don't know  
Who do you love?  
That I want  
If you had  
If you knew me  
  
(There is nothing in your eyes)  
There is nothing in your eyes  
(But that's the way you cry)  
But that's the way you cry, girl (cry, girl)  
(All is grand, all is bright)  
All is grand, all is bright  
(You're just steady in my mind)  
  
I walk around I'm sufferin'  
In my doom  
When I come to you,  
You're sittin' in your room  
You sit around in the strangest place  
So take off the mask  
So I can see your face  
Who do you love?  
  
Is it me?  
Well, I don't know  
Who do you love?  
That I want ya  
If you had  
I know you  
  
(Heaven must be weary)  
Heaven must be weary  
(Your smile is scary)  
You got me scared, girl  
(Insincere, empty tears)  
?  
You got me scared, girl  
  
(Heaven must be weary)  
Heaven must be weary  
(Your smile is scary)  
You know ooh, babe  
(Insincere, empty tears)  
?  
Na na na  
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)  
  
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom  
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room  
You sit around in the strangest place  
So take off the mask, so I can see your face  
  
Who do you love?  
Is it me?  
Well, I don't know  
Who do you love?  
Gotta want ya  
If he had  
I know you  
  
Who do you love?  
Is it me?  
Well,  
I don't know  
Who do you love?  
God I want ya  
If he can  
I don't know  
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)  
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)  
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
