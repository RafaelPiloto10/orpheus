Sometimes when I get upset  
You chill me out and put it to rest  
When I feel in dangerous times  
You make a call and give me a sign  
  
You wrap me up in love a color so sublime  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself  
  
When life is bitter and sore  
Just one look changes it all  
Could never be a jealous young man  
Cause you hold the key to my hand  
  
You wrap me up in love a color so sublime  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself  
  
Because our love is real I won't dominate you, fool around  
And faith and trust is all there is and true creation  
Guards it with her soul  
  
Sometimes when I don't feel well  
Emotional fall under your spell  
You heal me I'm better inside  
Sure seems good to be alive  
  
You wrap me up in love a color so sublime  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself  
  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself
