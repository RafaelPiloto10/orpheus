May God bless and keep you always  
May your wishes all come true  
May you always do for others  
And let others do for you  
  
May you build a ladder to the stars  
And climb on every rung  
And may you stay forever young  
  
May you grow up to be righteous  
May you grow up to be true  
May you always know the truth  
And see light that's surrounding you  
  
May you always be courageous  
Stand upright and be strong  
May you stay forever young  
  
Forever young  
Forever young  
May you stay forever young  
  
May your hand always be busy  
And your feet always be swift  
May you have a strong foundation  
When the winds of changes shift  
  
May your heart always be joyful  
And your song may it be sung  
And may you stay forever young  
  
Forever young  
Forever young  
May you stay forever young
