I'm running here  
I'm running there  
I'm looking for a girl  
Cause there's nothing I need  
There's nothing I want more  
In the whole wide world  
  
Well, I need it quick  
And I need it now  
Before I start to fade away  
That's why I'm searching  
That's why I'm looking  
Each and every day  
  
Oh, I need some love  
I said I need some love!  
Oh yes, I need some love  
This feeling I can't rise above  
Yeah, yeah!  
  
Well I been hustling here,  
I been hustling there  
I been searching for about a week  
And I started feeling  
This strange sensation  
My knees are starting getting weak  
  
Well I need what keeps  
A young man alive,  
I'm saying I need it now  
I'm gonna get the message  
Across to you  
Someway, somehow  
  
Oh, I need some love  
I said I need some love!  
Oh yes, I need some love  
This feeling I can't rise above  
Oh, yeah yeah!
