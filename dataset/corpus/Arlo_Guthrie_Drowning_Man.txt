Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
I remember when I met you  
Underneath the evening sky  
Now it seems I could forget you  
Rescue me, I'm bound to die  
All the promises we made there  
With no words to understand  
And though I've tried I've come up empty  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
CHORUS:  
I'm going down for the third time  
And I need a helping hand  
The rooster crows and I'm sinking  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
Where are you, my dear companion  
How much longer must you be  
I'm all alone out on the ocean  
When will you come and rescue me  
It's too late for new beginnings  
In this world I've left behind  
There is nothing left worth keeping  
Not a thing to change my mind  
CHORUS  
How far down the road to glory  
Must we go without a sign  
Caught out on these stormy waters  
How can you treat me so unkind  
Did you know from the beginning  
That I'd dig this lousy hole  
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned  
In this dark night of the soul  
CHORUS
