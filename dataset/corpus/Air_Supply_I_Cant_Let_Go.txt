I have the ring that needs your finger  
I want you always to remember  
I want you to be a part of my dreams  
I was so lonely here without you  
I was so cold just like a statue  
Being with you has made me complete  
  
I can feel your loving touch inside me  
I can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
  
Every day and every night  
I never thought your love could feel so right  
Every day and through the night  
Let me be the one to hold you tight  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let to  
You're a part of me, don't you know  
  
Would you give me just a lifetime  
I'll stand beside you through the years that come and go  
Nothing at all could stand in our way  
  
I can feel your answer deep inside me  
I can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
  
Every day and every night  
I never thought your love could feel so right  
Every day and through the night  
Let me be the one to hold you tight  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let to  
You're a part of me, don't you know
