I take you walking out tonight  
I'm looking good for you  
What you see is what you get  
You won't need a clue  
Come on girl, give it all you've got  
Don't just stand and stare  
Love, love, love, love  
Love me if you really dare  
And you know that I'll come  
I'll do it anywhere  
In and out and up and down  
As long as we get there  
Push it's love, make it feel so good  
Push it's love, do it like you should  
I can't stop when you're so hot  
Oh, really let it go  
It's standing up or sitting down  
Come on, let me know  
Make it to the music  
Love it like you don't care  
Down, down, down, down  
Get it right down there  
And you know that I'll come  
I'll do it anywhere  
In and out, up and down  
As long as we get there  
Push it's love, make it feel so good  
Push it's love, do it like you should  
When I get to rollin' now  
Watch this trouser snake  
An', oh my baby, hang on in  
Keep on till you shake  
When you dance, dressed way low  
I'll be at your feet  
You know, know, know, know  
You're good enough to eat  
And you know that I'll come  
I'll do it anywhere  
In and out, up and down  
As long as we get there  
Push it's love, make it feel so good  
Push it's love, do it like you should
