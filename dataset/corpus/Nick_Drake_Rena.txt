I got my plans  
From trembling hands  
I knew just what to do  
Follow each step carefully  
And hope they pulled me through  
My father ran  
To different lands  
And not a word we spoke  
But I was here  
To conquer fear  
And bring some glory home  
  
There's a world of hate and sorrow  
Out there standing in your way  
There's a load of compromise  
Before you die  
And each time you step forward you get burned a little bit  
No longer know the way  
To say goodbye  
Now I'm down here underneath  
Your bedroom light  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight  
  
I look in through  
The window  
And I though I'd take  
My chance  
I taught myself to play  
So I could be where people danced  
No higher call  
Than stars that fall  
I waited patiently  
A thousand miles of pavement  
That became my destiny  
  
You can wait a lonely lifetime  
Wondering when it's gonna come  
You can while away the hours  
Getting stoned  
But one day you get lucky  
And you look in someone's eyes  
That tell you you don't  
Have to be alone  
Now I'm falling back  
Just out of your sight  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight  
  
Oh now I know the way things go  
And what I put you through  
Cause when they try to get to me  
They get to me through you  
  
I know it's not the kind of hurt  
That's easily set right  
And I know you got your reasons  
To stay inside  
But nothing ever happens  
When it's left out on it's own  
You locked in there with  
Just your wounded pride  
I'm down here and I'm  
Way too tired to fight  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight  
Rena please come out  
With me tonight
