That last train done left town  
That last train done left town  
I heard the whistle moaning low  
That last train done gone down  
  
My sweet baby's on that train  
My sweet baby's on that train  
I wonder if I will see her again  
That last train done gone down  
  
I heard that whistle moanin' low  
I heard that whistle moanin' low  
I'm begging and pleading, please don't go  
That last train done gone down  
  
I'm sorry for what I've done  
I'm sorry for what I've done  
Too late good-bye, my sweet baby cried  
That last train done left town  
  
That last train done left town  
That last train done left town  
I heard that whistle moanin' low  
That last train done gone down
