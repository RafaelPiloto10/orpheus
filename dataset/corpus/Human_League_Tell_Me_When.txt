Tell me when, tell me when.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when.  
Kelly took a lifetime searching for the bottom line.  
I wasn't in to searching 'cause I was doing fine.  
I wasn't into fighting, chasing, sweating, slaving, fretting, lacing.  
Any waste of effort wasn't part of my design.  
Billy was an inspiration, positive and kind,  
until he let confusion overcome his youthful mind.  
Common sense dictated I could never be so blind and then,  
then I see you.  
  
Tell me when, tell me when.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when.  
Happenstance and episode unplanned to load in time.  
Coincidence, the second chance resounding like a rhyme.  
Our paths may cross against the odds to wreck the plans you made,  
among the crowd, a face that smiles to melt your masquerade.  
"If only I could see you," says a stranger deep inside and lets you know that  
when you were so sure you really lied.  
"If only I could see you," says the voice within your brain  
and quietly, insistently it says it once again.  
And then I really need to know.  
  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when.  
If wouldn't seem so lonely, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you. (If only, if only.)  
Baby, you could be free, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you. (If only, if only.)  
You'll never have to doubt me, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you. (If only, if only.)  
Baby, you could free me, (If only, if only.)  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you.  
If only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could. . .  
  
If only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could see you,  
if only I could see you, if only I could. . .  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.  
Tell me when will I see you again.
