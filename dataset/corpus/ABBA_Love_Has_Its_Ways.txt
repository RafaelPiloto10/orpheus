Spring in the air  
The sun was shining  
Still the day was cool  
Saw her waiting for a bus  
As she was going home from school  
  
Looking so cold  
I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away
