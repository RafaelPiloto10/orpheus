No tricks  
Up my sleeve  
I kicked the downs  
And now I'm clean  
No shakes  
Up my spine  
I beat the speed and I  
Dumped the wine  
No tracks  
That was yesterday  
I changed my style  
The way I play  
(Don't you believe it)  
No blues  
No depression  
No more panic  
Or obsession  
Don't you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
It's just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin' at his back door  
... this kid's straight  
And put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes  
No tracks  
That was yesterday  
I changed my style  
The way I play  
(Don't you believe it)  
No blues  
No depression  
No more panic  
Or obsession  
Some tricks  
Just go away  
And other tricks  
They're here to stay  
(Oh don't you know me)  
Sometimes my spirit's willin'  
The flesh is weak and  
That's what's killin'  
Don't you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
It's just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin' at his back door  
Hey now this kid's straight  
Put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes  
I tried so hard  
But I'm hurting for another fix  
It's just this habit  
I, I can always kick  
What do you say there friend?  
(Don't you call me..)  
It's just a game  
And I can beat it any day  
No matter what this lovely lady say  
Hey, want to be my friend?  
Some tricks  
They go away  
And other tricks  
They're here to stay  
(Oh don't you know me)  
Sometimes my spirit's willin'  
My flesh is weak and  
That's what's killin'  
Don't you believe  
Anything he said  
All them junkies talk that way  
It's just as bad as it was before  
I see the man knockin' at his back door  
I said this kid's straight  
And put on ice  
The street corner deals at any price  
Come on and check my veins  
And check my eyes
