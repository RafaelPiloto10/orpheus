There you are holding her hand  
I am lost  
Dying to understand  
Didn't I cherish you right  
Don't you know you were my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Even though I try I can't let go  
Something in your eyes  
Captured my soul  
And every night I see you in my dreams  
You're all I know  
I can't let go  
  
Just cast aside  
You don't even know I'm alive  
You just walk on by  
Don't care to see me cry  
And here I am  
Still holding on  
I can't accept  
My world is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside  
Everyday of my life  
Do you know the way it feels  
When all you have just dies  
I try and try to deny that I need you  
But still you remain on my mind  
  
No I just can't get you out of my mind  
I never can say goodbye  
'Cause every night  
I see you in my dreams  
  
You're all I know  
I can't let you go  
Even though I try  
I can't let go of something I need so badly  
You're all I know  
I can't let go
