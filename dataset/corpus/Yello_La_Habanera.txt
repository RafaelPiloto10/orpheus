This is Havana  
The night before the revolution  
Carlos Romero Pambo plays the symphony  
For latin piano  
Popping corks and blasting bullets  
La Habanera dances in the streets  
And like every night  
Pedro Comacho sells peanuts  
Outside the Tropicana Club  
  
Don't ask me why  
Life is one day  
La Habanera  
La Habanera  
She dances on the street at night  
La Habanera  
La Habanera  
She is ready for a fight  
  
Don't ask my why  
  
Pedro Comacho  
The former informer of the secret police  
Is still standing outside the club  
Pretending to be blind  
He watches the last plane to Miami  
Disappearing in a flaming purple sky  
Now he knows  
He has been left behind  
  
Don't ask me why  
Life is one day  
La Habanera  
La Habanera  
She dances under street lights  
La Habanera  
La Habanera  
She is ready for a fight
