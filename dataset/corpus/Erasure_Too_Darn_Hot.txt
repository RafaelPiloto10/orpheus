It's too darn hot  
It's too darn hot  
I like to sup with my baby tonight  
Refill the cup with my baby tonight  
I like to sup with my baby tonight  
Refill the cup with my baby tonight  
But I ain't up to my baby tonight  
'Cause it's too darn hot  
  
It's too darn hot  
It's just too darn hot  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
But brother you fight my baby tonight  
'Cause it's too darn hot  
  
According to the Kinsey report  
Every average man you know  
Much prefers his lovey dovey to court  
When the temperature is low  
But when the thermometer goes way up  
And the weather is sizzling hot  
Mr. Pants for romance is not!  
Because it's too darn hot (too hot!)  
It's too darn hot  
It's too darn hot  
  
Oh, it's too darn hot  
It's too darn hot  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
But brother you fight my baby tonight  
'Cause it's too darn hot  
  
Mr. Gob for his squab  
A marine for his queen  
A g.i. for his cutie-pie is not  
Oh it's too darn hot  
It's too darn hot  
It's too darn hot!  
I gotta get the heat down  
Gotta get the heat down
