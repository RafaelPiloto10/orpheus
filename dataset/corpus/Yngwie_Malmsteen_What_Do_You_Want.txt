I was carried to you  
By the hands of my fate  
Thought it was too late  
I wasn't the type that believed in true love  
At first sight  
you changed it to the right  
I know what I feel  
This is real  
I give you my body and soul  
Let your resistance drop  
Don't have to stop  
Don't have to stop  
By the siren's call  
I cry I try tell me what do you want  
I cry I try tell me what do you want  
I'm not the type to believe  
in a second chance  
Or in sweet romance  
I'm no beginner been fooling around before  
Still coming back for more  
Today is different  
It was meant  
I've found a reason  
I know what I feel  
This is real  
There's more than one season  
I cry I try tell me what do you want  
I cry I try tell me what do you want  
Time to think it over
