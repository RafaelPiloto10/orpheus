Here we go, come on  
Alright, little louder now  
Hey!  
  
Lookin' forward from center stage to Graduation Day  
Time to get the future started  
What we leave, what we take with us  
No matter what, it's somethin' we're part of  
  
We learned to fly together  
Side by side  
I just hope the rest of my life  
Would feel as good as my  
  
High School Musical  
Who says we have to let it go?  
It's the best part we've ever known  
Step into the future, we'll hold on to  
  
High School Musical  
Let's celebrate where we come from  
With friends who've been there all along  
Just like our high school, high school musical  
  
Improvisation without a script, no one's written it  
And now we have the chance to  
Someday we'll be lookin' back, memories we'll had  
All the songs that we lived through  
  
The best of times  
So why leave them behind?  
Why can't the rest of my life  
Be like my  
  
High School Musical  
Who says we have to let it go?  
It's the best part we've ever known  
Step into the future, we'll hold on to  
  
High School Musical  
Let's celebrate where we come from  
With friends who've been there all along  
That's right  
  
Now we finally realize who we are, it just took some time  
We have to live and to learn to see the truth  
(Learn to see the truth)  
Nothing's ever impossible, into the future we all free fall  
But forever we'll always have high school  
  
Time to party now, celebrate  
'Cause the world's one big stage  
And any part you want, it can be yours  
Everybody sing, yeah!  
  
And the show's never gonna close  
It's what it got us here, we know  
High School lives on forever more  
High School, high school musical  
  
High School Musical  
Who says we have to let it go?  
It's the best part we've ever known  
Step into the future we'll hold on to  
  
High School Musical  
Let's celebrate where we come from  
With friends who've been there all along  
Oh yeah, I wish my life could feel like a  
  
High School Musical  
Who says we have to let it go?  
It's the best part we've ever known  
Step into the future, we'll hold on to  
  
High School Musical  
Let's celebrate where we come from  
  
All together makes it better  
Memories that'll last forever  
I want the rest of my life to feel just like a  
High School Musical
