Yeah, they came to take me away  
Said I'd be sitting here for the rest of my life  
But I don't really care - I shot my wife  
And brother, I can't even remember the reason why  
  
  
Oh, it makes a long time man feel bad  
Yeah, it makes a long time man feel bad  
Well I ain't had no love since I don't know when  
It sure makes a long time man feel bad  
  
  
We was down in Jacksonville  
A cold winter night  
My baby and I, we began to fight  
I heated up, and I grabbed my gun  
I get so cold on those nights down south  
  
  
She was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor  
She looked up at me and began to smile  
Her gasping words: "Baby, I love you"  
Then she closed those baby blue eyes  
  
  
(chorus, and variations)  
  
  
Sometimes I hear you call my name in the dead of the night  
  
  
I ain't had those arms around me  
I ain't had those lips, those lips, around me  
  
  
It sure makes a long time man feel bad  
So bad
