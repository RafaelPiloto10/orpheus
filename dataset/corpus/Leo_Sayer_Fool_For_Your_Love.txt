Oo, but love was just so hard to find  
Until you came along into my life  
Then I thought I would lose my mind  
When you said that you wanted to be mine  
And ever since that day I've been hooked  
And nothin' could turn me away  
This livin' with you's like a dream come true  
And it grows more and more every day  
  
Oo, I'm reachin' the highest of highs  
Every time I look in your eyes  
Ask how I feel I can say it out loud  
I feel like a million inside  
I never thought this could happen to me  
You got me just where you want me baby  
For your love I would do anything  
Every night I'm a fool for your love yeah  
  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Hey I'm just a fool for your love  
  
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town  
When my day's work is all through  
The sun and the lights  
Well I wish I could fly just to get back faster to you  
I waited all day by the telephone  
Starin' at the clock on the wall  
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms  
And I just can't wait to hold you  
  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Hey I'm just a fool for your love  
  
Oo, you're givin' me chills up my spine  
I'm feelin' so fine goin' out of my mind  
Then and I don't care if it never stops  
I'll love you right up until I drop  
  
You know I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love
