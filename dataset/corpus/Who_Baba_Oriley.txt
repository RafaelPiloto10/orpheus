Out here in the fields,  
I fight for my meals,  
I get my back into my living.  
I don't need to fight,  
To prove I'm right,  
I don't need to be forgiven.  
  
Don't cry,  
Don't raise your eye,  
It's only teenage wasteland.  
  
Sally take my hand,  
We'll travel south cross land,  
Put out the fire,  
And don't look past my shoulder.  
The Exodus is here,  
The happy ones are near,  
Let's get together, before we get much older.  
  
Teenage wasteland,  
It's only teenage wasteland,  
Teenage wasteland,  
Oh yeah, teenage wasteland,  
They're all wasted!
