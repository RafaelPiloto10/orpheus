(Mose Allison)  
  
I don't want much in this world  
It's th' simple things I treasure  
'Till I die I would get by on fame, riches and sensual pleasure  
  
I don't ask much in this life  
No special consideration  
Just treat me like His Majesty  
Of a friendly OPEC nation  
  
Some people  
Just don't know when to stop  
Some people  
Just won't quit until they reach the top  
  
But I'm so easy going  
I'd make my way through life  
On love and understanding  
From a rich and beautiful life  
  
Some people  
Just never seem to get enough  
Some people  
Want salvation, paradise and all that stuff  
  
But I'm so easy going  
Don't even keep the score  
All I want is plenty, but I will take more  
If you ask me  
I will take more  
Say please  
I will  
Take more
