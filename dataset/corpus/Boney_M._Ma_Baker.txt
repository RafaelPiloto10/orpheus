This is the story of ma Baker the meanest cat from old Chicago town  
She was the meanest cat  
In old Chicago town  
She was the meanest cat  
She really mowed them down  
She had no heart at all  
No no no heart at all  
She was the meanest cat  
For she was really tough  
She left her husband flat  
He wasn't tough enough  
She took her boys along  
Cause they were mean and strong

One day they robbed a bank  
It was last foray  
The cops appeared too soon  
They couldn't get away  
With all the loot they had  
It made them mighty mad  
And so they shot it out

They didn't want to hang  
They died with blazing guns  
And so the story ends  
Of one who left no friends
