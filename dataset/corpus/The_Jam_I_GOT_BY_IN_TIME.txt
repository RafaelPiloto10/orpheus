Saw a girl that I used to know  
I was deep in thought at the time  
To recognize the face at first  
Cause I was probably looking at mine  
Well she was the only girl I've ever loved  
But my folks didn't dig her so much  
I was young  
This is serious  
To me she was the world (she was my world now)  
I thought I'd never live without her,  
But I got by in time  
  
Well let me tell you now,  
Saw a guy that I used to know  
Man he'd changed so much  
I think it hurt him to say 'hello,  
Cause he hardly opened his mouth  
Yeah well he was my best friend a few years ago  
Truly inseparable  
  
We were young  
We were full of ideals  
We were gonna pull this whole world  
But something happened  
I didn't know why  
But that's the way that it goes.  
  
I suppose,  
What you say - what you do  
Don't mean nothing, nothing at all  
And all the bonds you make between ya  
Can be broken any time you want now  
Please tell me if my philosophy's wrong  
I've got to know the truth  
I don't mean to offend anyone but,  
You know it's something that I do, oh-  
  
So nice to see you tonight,  
And I'm so glad that you came  
Some of the people standing outside, say  
Sure feel the same  
Yeah my point is in a round about way  
Given time he'll always forget  
Cause the memories  
That ... me on  
To me everything (you're everything now)  
And it always will be mine, yeah  
And no one can take them away
