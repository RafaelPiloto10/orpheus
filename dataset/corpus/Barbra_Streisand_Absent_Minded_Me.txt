Absent minded me  
Absent minded me  
I'm losing a key  
Or missing a glove  
Just like me to lose my love  
Gotta find it, absent minded me  
Dizzy dopey me  
Mixed-up mopey me  
  
I'm way, way ahead  
Of the game then it starts  
How did i lose my king of hearts?  
Gotta find it, absent minded me  
There's my key  
Gee, i left it in the door  
There's my glove on the shelf  
Now if i don't find my love  
I'll be losing myself  
  
Gotta find him  
Gotta find him  
Absent minded me  
Absent minded me
