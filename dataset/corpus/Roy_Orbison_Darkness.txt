Darkness, only darkness  
Land of shadow  
That's where my heart goes  
Now I'm alone, I'm on my own  
  
Voices, I hear voices  
Sounds in the still night everywhere  
But you're not there  
No, you're not there  
  
Imagination brings you so near  
I reach for your lips, but they're not here  
All of my memories are closing in as one  
I walk a little faster, than I start to run  
  
Darkness, only darkness  
Land of shadow  
That's where my heart goes  
Now I'm alone, I'm on my own  
  
I long to hold you, thrill to your charm  
But how can I hold shadows in my arms?  
I reach to find you, stumbling through the night  
Searching in my sadness, looking for the light  
  
But there's darkness, only darkness  
Land of shadow  
That's where my heart goes  
Now I'm alone, I'm on my own
