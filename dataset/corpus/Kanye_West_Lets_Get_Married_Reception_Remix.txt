[Chorus:]  
Just gots me a crib and a new car too  
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe  
C'mon let's get married babe  
C'mon let's get married  
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house  
A lil white fence, just like this, babe  
C'mon let's get married babe  
Let's get married  
  
[Jagged Edge]  
Meet me at the alter  
In your white dress (your white dress)  
You won't ever need another man  
You never, ever want from another thing, no  
I've been feeling you  
I must confess (must confess)  
Ain't no gonna break this thang up  
I ain't going nowhere, no  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jagged Edge]  
Said you want some karats  
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)  
Is it good enough for you to brag on  
When you show your friends (show your friends)  
I just want to be with you  
Girl there ain't I think I won't do  
Want you to be the one to say I do  
We can start a family  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Kanye West]  
With my tuxedo  
He asked me do you take this  
Woman to hold and keep the safest  
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper  
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics  
Diamonds your bestfriend  
That makes sense because  
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts  
But as long as you gots your defenses up  
You can never get the love that was meant for ya  
Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna  
Club  
Real thugs don't never fall in love  
Always on the g-o, for the d-o  
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie  
Since my money get right theses days  
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades  
I gots the church, the ring  
There's something I'm forgetting  
Oh, we gotta have J. E. Sing at the wedding  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate  
They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate  
Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate  
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga 'scape  
House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake  
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break  
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand  
'Til he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan  
Created a buzz 'til where you gotta mention his name  
When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game  
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them  
G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them...
