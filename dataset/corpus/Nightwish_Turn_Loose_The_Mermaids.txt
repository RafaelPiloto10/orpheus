A kite above a graveyard grey  
At the end of the line far far away  
A child holding on to the magic of birth and awe  
  
Oh, how beautiful it used to be  
Just you and me far beyond the sea  
The waters, scarce in motion  
Quivering still  
  
At the end of the river the sundown beams  
All the relics of a life long lived  
Here, weary traveler rest your wand  
Sleep the journey from your eyes  
  
Good journey, love, time to go  
I checked your teeth and warmed your toes  
In the horizon I see them coming for you  
  
The mermaid grace, the forever call  
Beauty in spyglass on an old man's porch  
The mermaids you turn loose brought back your tears  
  
[4x]  
At the end of the river the sundown beams  
All the relics of a life long lived  
Here, weary traveler rest your wand  
Sleep the journey from your eyes
