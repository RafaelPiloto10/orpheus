Pack up all your things  
We're gonna be leaving  
Sooner than I thought  
Take the things you bought  
Clouds are gathering.  
  
Say goodbye to all your friends  
We're gonna be sorry  
For a while, that's how it goes  
But then again, who knows  
About the rain.  
  
I'm steppin' out  
I'm movin' on  
I'm gonna see the world  
Like a rollin' stone  
I'm gonna be somebody  
Oh, I'm steppin' out.  
  
Did you hear what he said?  
He said they  
Sold me down the river  
They thought I was a fool  
They said the rain would fall  
What did they know?  
  
Then I saw your face  
And the song that  
You were singin'  
Though I thought I knew the words  
The tune was quite absurd  
And out of key  
Doo dah dah dee.  
  
I'm steppin' out  
I'm moving on  
I'm gonna see the world  
Like a rolling stone  
I'm gonna be somebody...  
Oh, I'm steppin' out.
