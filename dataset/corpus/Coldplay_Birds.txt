Been standing in the corner  
Studying the lights  
The dreaming of escape  
Will keep you up at night  
  
But someone had put the flares up  
Got me in the rays so guess I better stay  
"Uh uh, no come on!" You say  
  
"It's a fools gold thunder  
It's just warring rain  
Don't let the fears just start  
'What if I won't see you again'  
  
Around here you never  
Want to sleep all night  
So start falling in love, start the riot  
And come on, rage with me  
  
We don't need words, we'll be birds  
Got to make our own key"  
  
Only got this moment, you and me  
Guilty of nothing but geography  
  
Come on raise it  
Come on and raise this noise  
For the million people, who got not one voice  
  
Come on it's not over!  
If you mean it say loud  
Come on all for love  
Out from the underground away with me  
  
We don't need words  
Close your eyes and see  
We'll be birds flying free  
Holding on in the mystery  
  
Fearless through this you said  
We'll go through this together  
So when you fly won't you - won't you take me too?  
In this world so cruel I think you're so cool
