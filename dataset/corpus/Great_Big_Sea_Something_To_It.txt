I'm sorry if I ruined your day  
I really hope that you understand  
I'm a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land  
  
My father phoned me yesterday  
Your time has come, well done my son  
Tried to think of what to say  
When words can heed already gone  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how I got here  
There must be something to it  
I think I need some time alone  
To work my way through it  
  
The moon is in the sky tonight  
Not very warm but it sheds some light  
Ask me now and I just might  
Let the morning come and tell me if its right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soon initial bliss will pass  
This precious time might be your last  
Like dew upon the morning grass,  
Good intentions can vanish with the sun  
  
I'm sorry if I ruined your day  
I really hope that you understand  
I'm a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land  
I'm a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land
