I realize, realize  
I get a little bit wild sometimes  
Am I numb, am I numb, to what we have become, sometimes  
So slip away the mistake, with me  
Everything's okay, with me, right  
Don't have to run, have to run  
We can walk in the sun one last time  
  
And it feels, yeah it feels so good  
When you're here  
We are here to love  
  
People come, people go  
But I like to get to know you now  
What is wrong with me, wrong with me  
Why don't you belong to me now  
So through my way, with me, stay with me  
I was a baby right  
Am I dumber than I think to time it down tonight  
  
And it feels, yeah it feels so good  
When you're here  
We are here to love  
Not giving up, no  
If it feels so good  
When you're here, so close  
We are here to love  
  
And I can't slow down  
And I need you now  
  
And I can't slow down  
And I need you now (And I need you now, yeah)  
  
And it feels, yeah it feels so good  
When you're here  
We are here to love  
Not giving up, no  
If it feels so good  
When you're here, so close  
We are here to love  
  
Not giving up, not giving up, not giving up, not giving up  
Not giving up, not giving up, not giving up  
  
Don't have to run, have to run  
We can walk in the sun one last time
