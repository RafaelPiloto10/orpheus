You ask me what I want.  
You ask me what I need.  
It's nothing you can buy.  
My heart's not ruled by greed.  
I don't love a diamond.  
Diamond's you see through.  
I want you to hold me.  
I want you to be true.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
  
Like the colors of the sun,  
The feelings in your heart.  
It's all I want from you.  
And when the sky is dark  
I'll have you beside me.  
Who could ask for more?  
I'll just wear a smile  
When you walk in the door.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
  
Give me the gift of love.  
Look me in the eyes.  
Say I'm the one.  
That'd be the best surprise.  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day,  
In the dark of night.  
Always. Oooooh.
