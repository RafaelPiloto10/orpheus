I love the winter weather  
So the two of us can get together  
There's nothing sweeter, finer  
When it's nice and cold I can hold my baby closer to me  
And collect the kisses that are due me  
I love the winter weather  
Because I've got my love to keep me warm  
I love the winter weather  
'Cause that's when you and I can get together  
  
There's nothing sweeter, finer  
When there's ice and snow  
Don't you know I'll hold you tightly to me  
And I will get that love that is due me  
I love the winter weather  
Because I've got my love to keep me warm  
Take the summer you can have a ball  
Take the springtime or even the fall  
But I guess I like the winter most of all  
  
I love the winter weather  
When the two of us can get together

I love the winter weather  
Because I've got my love to keep me warm  
Take the summer you can have a ball  
Take the springtime even the fall  
But I guess I like the winter most of all  
Oh, I love winter
