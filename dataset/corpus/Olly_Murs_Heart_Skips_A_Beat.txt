My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat.  
  
I can see you're not yourself  
Even when you're here with me  
I know that you're somewhere else  
  
So put another record on  
Kiss and leave me on  
Nothing really matters when we're dancing  
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat  
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat  
  
So come on, spin me around  
Now I don't wanna go home  
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat  
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone  
And when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
So hung up, we can't let go  
If you really have to leave  
One more time just move me slow  
  
So put another record on  
Play it on repeat,  
Nothing really matters when we're dancing  
Cause all you ever need to know, is what you do to me,  
And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat  
  
So come on, spin me around  
Now I don't wanna go home  
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat  
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone  
And when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Rizzle Kicks, Yeah  
At the start of the night I was like, what?  
Let's have a team talk,  
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for,  
Flaps keep going up and down like a see-saw  
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see saw,  
Ooh, she let me sit with her, I figured her figure's a sure sure winner,  
'Cause I got a lead from the back, I'ma skipper  
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat.  
  
So come on, spin me around  
Now I don't wanna go home  
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat  
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone  
And when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh (My heart skips, skips a beat)  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh (My heart skips, skips a beat)
