Let them know that we're still rock n roll  
I don't care about my makeup  
I like it better with my jeans all ripped out  
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut  
You say so what  
(What)  
  
I don't care if I'm misfit  
I like it better then the hipster of all shit  
I am the mother fucking princess  
You still love me  
  
Some some how  
It's a little different when  
I'm with you  
You know what I really am  
On the phone  
You know how it really goes  
(Oh oh oh oh yeh)  
  
Some some way  
We'll be getting out of this  
Time one day  
You're the only one that I  
Want with me  
You know how the story goes  
(Oh oh oh)  
  
When it's you and me  
We don't need no one to tell us who to be  
We'll keep turning up the radio  
Well it's you and I  
Just put up  
A middle finger to the sky  
That them know that we're still rock n roll  
  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey
