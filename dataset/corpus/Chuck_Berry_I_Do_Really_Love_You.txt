It's you I'm in love with  
It's not what you are  
It's not how you treat me  
Or your fancy car  
But there's something about you  
I keep yearning for  
I, I do really love you  
Just thinking about you  
Gives me such a thrill  
Let alone to be with you or know that I will  
And know that I'll tremble  
When I should be still  
Um, um, I, I do really love you  
Give me what I live for  
Your sweet lips pressed to me  
And transform this yearning into ecstasy  
And send me, oh, send me - most humbly  
Um, um, I, I do really love you
