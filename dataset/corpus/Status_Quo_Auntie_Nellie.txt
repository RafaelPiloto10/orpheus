Sitting here with Auntie Nelly, she is so alone  
Talking idly, she's in no hurry, I wish I could go  
But how could I just say Goodbye, there's no-one who she knows  
  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
  
She's getting old and weary, oh it's such a shame  
'Cause she's been good to everyone but now they don't know her name  
  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
  
Sitting here with Auntie Nelly, she is so alone  
Talking idly, she's in no hurry, I wish I could go  
But how could I just say Goodbye, there's no-one who she knows  
  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
She's so alone, she'd die if I should go  
No I can't leave my Auntie Nellie, no  
She's so alone...
