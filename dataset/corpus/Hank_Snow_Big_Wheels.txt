Oh them big wheels are turning goin' somewhere  
And they're carryin' her away from my side yes I cried thought I'd die  
Love was just a game to me I thought I'd never cry  
I thought she'd be the loser but standin' here am I  
And that long train is rolling goin' somewhere  
And it's carryin' her away from my side yes I cried thought I'd die  
A broken heart is somethin' that I have never had  
But I learned the hard way didn't know it hurt so bad  
And them big wheels are turnin' goin' somewhere  
And it's carryin' her away from my side (yes he cried thought he'd die)  
This burnin' love unwanted this love that never dies  
Keeps right on a hurting no matter how I try  
And that old rattler rolling goin' somewhere  
And it's carryin' her away from my side yes I cried thought I'd die  
Many years I've fooled around and many years I've lied  
I'd always be a leaving with that suitcase by my side  
But that big engine's rolling goin' somewhere  
And it's carryin' her away from my side yes I cried thought I'd die  
Yes I cried thought I'd die
