I told you that I'd never come around again but here I am again here I am
again  
I said I'd never let you get me down again here I am again here I am  
Here I am here we are the story's gettin' old  
I know I can't go on to you but worse than bad I can't let go  
I said words I swore I'd never speak but again here I am again here I am again  
I thought I could stay strong but I got weak again and here I am again here I
am  
Here I am here we are...  
And oh the nights're cold and I could use a friend so here I am again here I
am again
