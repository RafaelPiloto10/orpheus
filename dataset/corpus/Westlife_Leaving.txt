Watching the clock on the wall  
Been a while since you called  
I can't help but wait  
It's late and I can't get no sleep  
Something's different this time  
It just doesn't feel right  
Have we broken in two?  
Am I really gonna lose you tonight?  
You come walking in  
Tears in your eyes  
Pretending like it's alright  
  
But I know you're leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell you've been crying  
You're gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But you've made up your mind  
I beg you don't go  
But I already know you're leaving  
  
Where does the time go?  
Between goodbye and hello  
How did we come to this is there something we missed  
Along the way  
With your bags at the door  
I wanna pull you in close  
And hold you once more even though  
  
But I know you're leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell you've been crying  
You're gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But you've made up your mind  
I beg you don't go  
But I already know you're leaving  
  
Here come the sleepless nights  
Here come the tears I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the last goodbye leaving us behind  
Oh this can't be right  
  
But I know you're leaving  
I know that smile  
I can tell you've been crying  
You're gonna say goodbye  
I wish I could stop you  
But you've made up your mind  
I beg you don't go  
But I already know you're leaving
