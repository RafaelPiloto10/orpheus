Yeah  
It's nothing new  
'Cause this is exactly what I do  
What up E, haha  
The good weeds lit on this one, yeah  
Riding by myself  
  
The world turning, the weed burning  
Them haters talking, I keep earning  
Know some will say that life's a bitch  
Well I'ma flirtin' and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases  
Old folks jock my car 'cause they know just what this is  
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants  
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat  
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' bitch then what you call that  
Nothing but net, ain't back 'cause I never left  
I did everything right nigga better yet  
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us  
Something like a contractor building from the ground up  
Now just, oh  
Twist up this weed  
Realize that you are in the presence of a G  
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese  
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees  
Fuck it, you know what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm riding round, smoking, my music up loud  
Kinda doin' my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me  
Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
I'm in a race, and taking the winners place  
No foot on the brakes  
One the best, homie that's what they call me  
It's lonely at the top, got no company so  
Now I just stunt on my own  
Now I just stunt on my own  
  
See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me  
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me  
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty  
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's  
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's  
My dime piece only recognize the best tree's  
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe  
You in her face (You in her face)  
I let her breath  
  
From debated on, to waited on  
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on  
Cause we are,  
Young movie stars  
Cause we are,  
Young movie stars  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
  
Oh-ooh-oh, now I just stunt on my own  
Bitches ain't say shit to me  
But now they won't leave me alone  
Used to walk the other way  
But now they all come to my home  
And they calling my phone,  
'Cause my paper is long  
Heard nothing, but they singing my songs  
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along  
We flying up, no you wont need a ticket at all  
Need a ticket at all  
Tell 'em bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas 'n' all  
'Cause I remember days we'd sit and picture it all  
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall  
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star  
Cause we are, young, gifted,  
Not to mention out here making motherfucking millions  
Yeah, I said it, motherfucking millions  
Got my money up, I'm in the building  
Yup  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
