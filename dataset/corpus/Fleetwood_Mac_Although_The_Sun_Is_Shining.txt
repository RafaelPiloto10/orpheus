Although the sun is shining  
High above  
There's one thing on my mind  
You my love  
  
I see a weeping willow  
In the park  
Like this there's sadness growing  
In my heart  
  
When we're together  
We will never part  
And if you leave me  
It'll break, it'll break my heart  
  
When we're together  
We will never part  
And if you leave me  
It'll break, it'll break my heart  
  
Although the sun is shining  
High above  
There's one thing on my mind  
You my love
