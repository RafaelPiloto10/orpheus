Till another little ray  
Care about the day your heart breaks up  
When you lose your way  
  
I'm hellbound in this life  
Keep fighting the coldest wars  
It's always been like this but don't know why  
  
And sleeping in your mind  
You feel it, ties you down  
Going down  
I'll go by  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
It's where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
But I'm still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I can't breathe  
Woo  
  
These days are only now  
Breathe in the coldest lies  
I think it's only what you have in mind  
Hold onto the best of you  
I hit the pavement  
Going down  
Don't know why  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
It's where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
But I'm still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I can't breathe  
  
No, I'm patient  
But this colours that I live  
All alone in this life  
I cannot see  
Dreams we hide are solid  
But we can't let her bleed  
Maybe what we make  
Can you see?  
Oh  
  
(I will fight in this life  
Defying the coldest wars  
It's always been like this  
But don't know why)  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
It's where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
I'm still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I can't breathe  
Woo  
(Your fear will chain you down)  
  
Till I know a little rain  
Care about the day your heart breaks up  
When you lose your way
