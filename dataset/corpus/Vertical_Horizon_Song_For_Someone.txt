This is a song for someone all alone  
This is a song to play when they are gone  
To help you to begin again even though you've just begun  
This is a song for someone  
  
This is a song for someone wide awake  
This is a song to give a little break  
To help you slow down a bit now that the day is done  
This is a song for someone  
  
Someone who laughs  
Someone who cries  
Someone whose heart beats just like mine  
Another soul who soldiers on  
Oh, this is a song for someone  
  
This is a song for someone on the line  
This is a song to help you kill the time  
May you come home again sooner than the son  
This is a song for someone  
  
Someone who laughs  
Someone who cries  
Someone whose heart beats just like mine  
Another soul who soldiers on  
Oh, this is a song for someone  
  
I can't believe is that the full to feel when all the time is done  
I hope to see the uncertainty leave before we're gone  
  
This is a song for someone looking back  
There is something good that someone said you lack  
May it make you whole again if only while it runs  
This is a song for someone  
  
Someone who laughs  
Someone who cries  
Someone whose heart beats just like mine  
Another soul who soldiers on  
Oh, this is a song for someone  
Yeah, this is a song for someone  
  
This is a song for someone I don't know  
May your days get brighter as you go  
I guess it's never easy to love what we become  
This is a song for someone
