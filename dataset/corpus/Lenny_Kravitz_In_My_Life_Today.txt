When my memory starts to wander  
I sit back and I ponder  
How the whole world's gone asunder  
I feel the rain and I hear the thunder  
  
I was bare and I was lost  
But you were there and now I'm born  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today  
  
And oh how I thank you father  
For giving us all over and under  
You're a mystery You're a wonder  
I always knew since I was younger  
  
I think about the way that you make it right  
So full of love and sacrifice  
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
But you were right and I was wrong, yeah  
'Cause I was weak but you were strong,  
Ohoh hey hey yeah  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today  
  
And now that the darkness has faded  
I'm no longer blinded I can see, yeah  
And I don't have to wait no longer  
'Cause it's all about being free  
  
Every day every way  
I'm gonna get myself together  
Every day any way, ohoh  
  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today, yeah  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today, yeah  
  
You are the force, yeah  
And you are the reign,  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today, yeah  
  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today  
  
You are the force  
And You are the reign  
You make me try to do right  
And throw away my evil ways  
  
Yeah, yeah yeaaah oh yeah,  
Come on one more time,  
Take me now, oh oh oh oh.
