Time was once just a clock to me  
And life was just a book a biography  
Success was something you just had to be  
And I would spend myself unknowingly  
  
And you know that I could have me a million more friends  
And all I'd have to lose is my point of view  
But I had no idea what a good time would cost  
Till last night when I sat and talked with you  
  
An apple will spoil if it's been abused  
A candle disappears when its been used  
A rainbow may follow up a hurricane  
And I can't leave forever on a train  
  
And you know that I'd survive if I never spoke again  
And all I'd have to lose is my vanity  
But I had no idea what a good time would cost  
Till last night when you sat and talked with me  
  
You can smile for the lack of something else to do  
And no one will laugh and point a finger at you  
If your tears didn't always make me feel so bad  
Would you still cry every time that you felt sad?  
I thought I'd heard and seen enough to get along  
Till you said something neither of us knew  
And I had no idea what a good time would cost  
Till last night when I sat and talked with you
