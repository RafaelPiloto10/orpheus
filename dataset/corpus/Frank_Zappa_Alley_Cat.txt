Winged eel fingerling (elliot ingber) (slide guitar)  
Drumbo (john french) (drums)  
You may find me, baby  
Yeah, this street  
With my slippery fists  
Knock it like this n  
Knock it like that  
With my heart in a cage  
Tucked up under my hat  
Fluttering like a little black bird, yeh  
Just seen his furs, pussycat  
Got my umbrella up in front, yeah  
And over my head  
Ready to beat you, baby,  
If you don't let me in  
'cause it's raining  
'cause it's raining,  
Baby outside  
Well I'm tired and cold and hungry  
Been knocked like this an  
Knocked like that  
Don't see that bad backyard  
Alley cat  
I want dis little pussy  
Baby wants some o dis  
And some o dat  
Don't treat me, baby, like your  
Any old alley cat  
Alley cat  
Alley cat  
Alley cat  
Don't treat me, baby, like your  
Any old alley cat
