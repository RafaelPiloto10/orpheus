Long time since I've seen your smile  
But when I close my eyes  
I remember  
You were no more than a child  
But then so was I  
Young and tender  
Time carries on  
I guess it always will  
But deep inside my heart  
Time stands still  
Stay for awhile  
Well, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
Stay for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
For a moment it can seem  
Just the way it used to be  
Snowfalls, phone calls, broken hearts  
Clear summer days  
Warm and lazy  
Long walks, long talks, after dark  
We vowed we'd never forget  
Now it's hazy  
Time takes its toll  
And time alters our view  
It would be nice to  
Spend some time with you  
Oh, stay for awhile  
Well, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
(oohhh) stay for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
For a moment it can seem  
Just the way it used to be  
Stay...  
(please stay)  
Stay, stay, stay...  
One, two, one, two  
Stay for awhile  
Well, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
(oohhh) stay for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
Just the way it used to be  
Stay for awhile  
Oh, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
Won't you stay with me for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
For a moment it can seem  
Just the way it used to be  
(the way it used to be. be...  
The way it used to be, ooohhhh, aahhhh ooooh  
Now, now, now, now...hoohhh...)
