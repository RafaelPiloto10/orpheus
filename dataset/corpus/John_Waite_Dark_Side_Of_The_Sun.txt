I looked over my shoulder  
Straight into your eyes  
As you stood in my shadow  
In some loud disguise  
  
You were lookin' straight through me  
Like a piece of glass  
Out of step with the fashion  
Fashions always pass  
  
I've been living  
On the dark side of the sun  
Waiting for something  
That would never come  
  
Feeling restless and jaded  
My heartbeat paralyzed  
Like some refugee hero  
To beat denounced and denied  
  
In some rock and roll wasteland  
In a thousand hours  
While Madonnas keep smiling  
Present them with the flowers  
  
I've been living  
On the dark side of the sun  
Waiting for something  
That would never come  
  
And I've been running down the shadows  
Like a street gang to survive  
Hoping for something to keep me alive  
I looked over my shoulder  
  
Fire in my eyes  
We were looking for justice  
What we got was a great big surprise  
We've been living  
  
On the dark side of the sun  
Waiting for something  
That would never come  
And we've been running from the shadows  
  
Like some street gang to survive  
Waiting for something to keep us alive  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Been living on the dark side  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
And I've been running from the shadows  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh
