Lying in your arms  
So close together  
Didn't know just what I had  
Now I toss and turn  
Cause I'm without you  
How I'm missing you so bad  
  
Where was my head  
Where was my heart  
Now I cry alone in the dark  
  
[Chorus]  
I lie awake  
I drive myself crazy  
Drive myself crazy  
Thinking of you  
Made a mistake  
When I let you go baby  
I drive myself crazy  
Wanting you the way that I do  
(Wanting you the way that I do)  
  
I was such a fool  
I couldn't see it  
Just how good you were to me  
You confessed your love  
Undying devotion  
I confessed my need to be free  
  
And now I'm left  
With all this pain  
I've only got myself to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why didn't I know it  
(How much I loved you baby)  
Why couldn't I show it  
(If I had only told you)  
When I had the chance  
Oh I had the chance  
  
[Chorus: x2]
