So people ain't it time to feel  
Rather than gazing past reality  
So you run from the rock  
And you end up in the wilderness  
And the big bad wolf is getting vex  
You remember this  
  
[Chorus]  
Jah is true and perfect more holy than man  
Jah is true and perfect and those who are with him  
He that plant the seed is the son of man  
The field is the Earth, the food seeds are the children  
Joyful is men when the truth is known  
But sadness come with the lies they tell  
  
Well I dig this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey you remember this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So people ain't it time to feel  
Rather than gazing past reality  
So you run from the rock  
And you end up in the wilderness  
And the big bad wolf have no regrets  
  
But remember this, Jah is true and perfect more holy than man  
Yeah Jah is true and perfect and those who are with him  
Stay there  
Jah is true and perfect more holy than man  
Jah is true and perfect and those who are with him  
Stay there  
Jah is true and perfect more holy than man  
Jah is true and perfect and those who are with him  
Jah is true and perfect more holy than man
