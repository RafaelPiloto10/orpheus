Say boys and girls don't you want to have fun  
Why bother to walk when you'd rather run  
Why bother with books when you've got a gun  
Come fly with me right into the sun  
In another world, in another time  
I can picture you and me together  
If I close my eyes tight and think real hard  
I can float lighter than a feather  
If I try even harder who knows what I might find  
Why maybe a pearl of wisdom  
I would trade these pearls for a parcel of flesh  
In flesh we were all invented  
Is it time to play? Said the ratboy to the ratgirl  
Can we fly today, can we look here for some fresh kill  
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky  
Looking for a big surprise  
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture....  
In another world, in another time  
I can picture us a happy family  
With our happy kids all flying all around  
And leaving far behind the rat-race  
Is it time to play? Said the tortoise to the rabbit  
Can we fly today, are we creatures all of habit  
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky  
Waiting for a big surprise  
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture...  
Say boys and girls don't you want to have fun  
Why bother to crawl when you'd rather run  
Why bother to walk when you'd rather fly  
Come join the party way up in the sky  
Is it time to play? Said the ratboy to the ratgirl  
Can we fly today, can we look here for some fresh kill  
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky  
Looking for a big surprise  
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture...
