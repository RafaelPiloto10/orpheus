Peek-a-boo!  
I can see you  
And I know what you do  
So put your hands on your face  
And cover up your eyes  
Don't look until I signal  
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo!  
The way that we weren't is what we'll become  
So please pay attention while I show you some  
Of what's about to happen  
Peek-a-boo!  
I know what you do  
Cause I do it too  
Laugh if you want to or say you don't care  
If you cannot see it you think it's not there  
It doesn't work that way
