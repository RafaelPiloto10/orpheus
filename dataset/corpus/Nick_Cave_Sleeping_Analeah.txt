(Newbury, Folger)  
  
Yesterday the sun was shining but you're finding the sun it  
Don't shine all the time  
A winter day suddenly came your way  
And you ran into your mind  
  
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah  
Do you think you're ready for me?  
  
Oh and yesterday is gone forever and ever, never  
To be again  
You looked for the sunshine, that brought warmth to your mind  
But find only rain  
  
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah  
No, you're not ready for me  
  
But when yesterday becomes a memory, a memory  
That we uncovered in time  
If you still remember that cold September  
I reigned in your mind  
  
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah  
Then you'd be ready for me
