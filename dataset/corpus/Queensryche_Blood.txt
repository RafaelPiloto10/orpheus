Thank you for the lies, the lies you sold us  
Thank you for this vision, of violence.  
Thank you for this song, you gave me to sing  
Thank you for the capping day on a culture that lay dying.  
Yes, it's us that's dying  
Maybe it won't be long now that it's all gone on  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all gone wrong, there's blood on our hands  
It's all gone wrong, there's blood  
There's blood  
It's all gone wrong, There's blood on our hands.  
It's all gone wrong, there's blood  
blood on our hands.  
  
We saw them laying there, with their arms around each other  
Staring through their fear and the miles between our heads.  
You could have told the truth  
It was your decision to  
Sacrifice integrity and compassion for greed  
  
[Chorus]
