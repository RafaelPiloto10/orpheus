Say I don't mind  
What you do to me  
If you waste my time  
Then it's meant to be  
I called your number (Yes I did)  
Like you told me to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Like a puppet on a string  
I'm go'n dance and I'm go'n sing  
I will do most anything  
If you promise me da bang, bang, bang!  
  
Don't want to lie  
I just want to do it  
But some other guy (Baby)  
Has beat me to it  
If you're in love (Well)  
We're to of a kind (Yes we are)  
What good is your body, baby  
Without your mind (Not much)  
  
[Chorus]  
Hit me, niggas!  
  
So here's the story  
I'm here for you  
Without the boring  
Without the cool  
When you try to fake it (Baby)  
And you want to get through (You know what I'm talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bang, bang, bang!  
Yeah! Ooh!
