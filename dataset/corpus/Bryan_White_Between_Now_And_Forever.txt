I can't believe that I've found you  
Fate did a number on me  
If you end up with my arms around you  
It's meant to be  
  
Well, maybe my crazy is showing  
But maybe I'm hooked on your touch  
But wherever my life is going  
There ain't no rush  
'Cause  
  
Wherever you're going  
I'd like to go too  
If you don't have anything  
Better to do  
I'd love to spend  
Some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
I'll take the blue with the gray days  
I just pray the road will be long  
'Cause if I'm beside you there's no way  
I can go wrong  
  
Wherever you're going  
I'd like to go too  
If you don't have anything  
Better to do  
I'd love to spend  
Some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
I'd love to spend some more time together  
So what are you doing  
Between now and forever  
  
What are you doing  
Between now and forever
