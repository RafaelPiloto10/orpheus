Such a little thing  
Such a little thing  
But the difference it made was grave  
There you go  
Wielding a bicycle chain  
Oh, why won't you change?  
Change and be nicer?  
  
Such a little thing  
A gentle tone of kindness  
Or written words on paper  
Can you write?  
  
How I love all of  
The very simple things of life  
(God's good air)  
How I love all of  
The very simple things of life  
  
Such a little thing  
A fumbling politeness  
The difference saved me  
Wielding a bicycle chain  
Why won't you change?  
"I will not change  
And I will not be nice"  
Most people keep their brains  
Between their legs  
(don't you find?)  
  
Leave me alone - I was only singing  
Leave me alone because  
I was only singing  
Leave me alone - I was only singing  
Leave me alone  
You have just proved (again)  
Most people keep their brains  
Between their legs
