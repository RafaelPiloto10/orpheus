Lovers  
Lovers  
Lovers  
Lovers ev'rywhere!  
Ev'rywhere I go,  
In ev'ry face I see, the sign of love  
Shining so brightly.  
  
It's in the air,  
It's ev'rywhere, I can feel it in my bones,  
People holdin' hands,  
Makin' love really, really gettin' it on.  
  
I'm talkin' about lovers,  
Beautiful lovers  
Lovers ev'rywhere.  
Yeah, yeah, lovers,  
Beautiful lovers  
Lovers ev'rywhere.  
  
And ev'rywhere I go I hear people say  
That they wouldn't mind checkin' it out,  
Aw, gettin' down,  
Don't you know that life can be beautiful,  
Life can be wonderful when you can always have that special someone around  
  
And I'm talkin' 'bout lovers, ooo beautiful lovers,  
Don't you know that they're ev'rywhere,  
Lovers,  
Beautiful lovers,  
Ev'rywhere, ev'rywhere, ev'rywhere.  
  
If you like romancing and you don't want no dancin'  
Then check this groove out baby,  
You'll see  
It is the sweetest sugar that you'd ever taste,  
You gotta chase those blues, get over 'em  
Don't stop now  
Control 'em  
And then you'll find you're shakin' 'em  
Get it all while you can  
Have a ball.  
  
There's a feelin and it's catchin  
Look what's happ'nin,  
Take a trip  
Make it hip,  
'Cause you'll dig it!  
  
Lovers,  
Beautiful lovers  
Lovers ev'rywhere
