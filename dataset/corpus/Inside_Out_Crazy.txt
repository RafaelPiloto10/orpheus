  
A man decides after seventy years,  
That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door.  
While those around him criticize and sleep...  
And through a fractal on the breaking wall,  
I see you my friend, and touch your face again.  
Miracles will happen as we speak.  
But we're never gonna survive, unless...  
We get a little crazy  
No we're never gonna survive, unless...  
We are a little...  
Cray...cray...cray...Crazy  
Yellow people walking through my head.  
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one.  
And yet together they were friends at school  
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it  
if all were there when we first took the pill,  
When maybe, oh maybe, oh maybe, oh maybe...  
Miracles will happen as we speak.  
But we're never gonna survive unless...  
We get a little crazy.  
No we're never gonna survive unless...  
We go a little...Crazy...  
No no, never survive, unless we get a little... bit...  
  
In a sky full of people, only some want to fly,  
Isn't that crazy?  
In a world full of people, only some want to fly,  
Isn't that crazy? Crazy...  
In a heaven of people oh there's some want to fly,  
Isn't that crazy?  
In a world full of people there's only some want to fly,  
Isn't that crazy?  
Isn't that crazy... Isn't that crazy... Isn't that crazy...  
Ohh...  
But we're never gonna  
Survive unless, we get a  
Little crazy  
No we're never gonna  
Survive unless we go a  
Little crazy  
No we're never gonna  
Survive unless, we go a  
Little crazy  
No we're never gonna to  
Survive unless, we get a  
Little crazy  
No we're never gonna  
Survive unless, we get a  
Little
