Free and untamed that's how I've grown  
Settling down ain't my nature  
Roots I'll never own  
Oh your smile  
But tell me, ain't your child  
How can you cage a bird  
Born to be wild  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm Johnny Raven by and by  
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl  
Another nest to try  
Ooh Johnny Raven  
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you  
Yeah, but I gotta leave you  
When my restless heart says goodbye  
  
Look at you little girl  
You feel love so deep  
If I could change in a second  
I'd change for you like that  
Stay right here for keeps  
But I'm home free for no thrills  
Stray I will  
Seems I gotta need one girl  
Never can feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody knows my name  
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah by and by  
I'm gonna fly  
When you cry part of me's gonna die
