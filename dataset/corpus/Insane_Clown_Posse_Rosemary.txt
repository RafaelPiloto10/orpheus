Let me in this bitch. Let me get some change shit. Man fuck this dress code
bitch. I can dance  
Muthafucka. I can daaannncccee.  
  
I'm on crack, Walkin alleyways downtown, people drop change so I'm checkin the
ground behind a  
Nightclub, I can hear the bump outside I hear em' laughin' and drinkin' and
dancin' getin' live and  
I'm lonely, graspin' on my 55 cent, I don't know where my meds went, they been
spent and I'm bent, I  
Don't remember yesterday at all, I'm barkin at the moon as I'm pissin' on the
wall, people grippin'  
New cars checkin' out a few bars, they see me comin' side step a few yards I'm
like a bad man, holdin'  
Out my crusty ass hands scouldin' an imaginary friend scary and I'm blackin'
out just about to lose  
All hope, I was peerin through the window of a nightclub scopin', and there
she was everything I  
Planned for on the spotlight on the dance floor gravitatin'  
  
[Chorus]  
She kept her rythum her feet to the floor she dipped down she did the twirl
and she shook it some  
More she's ruby. She made me happy I tried to refrain I walk off but then I
run right back I'm at it  
Again she's callin'  
  
I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle, carjacked a mini-van and punched
full throttle right back  
To the spot then I waited to get her, but when she came out, she had a bitch-
boy wit' her no problem,  
Hit the pipe and follow em' home and my imaginary friend gone have to leave me
alone cause this really  
Goin' down I feel it pullin me home knowin I'm a wicked clown I gotta throw it
down, she pulled in her  
And her fuck ass strolled in, I hit the pipe again and jump out the stolen,
jumpin through back yards  
Clumsey and trippin', it don't matter where ya go there's a throat slingin',
and the way she danced  
Split flames burnin me alive out here quit playin games I'm on the side of her
house lookin in through  
The back den and there she was with him again dancin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I walk right in through the front door unlocked, no gun cocked, cinder block,
clown paint, I came  
Here to dance boogy, umph ahhh, and maybe tap a little nookie, I'm creepin
music bumpin in the back,  
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack, and here come the punk bout
to get champaighned, I  
Take the rock and pop em' with the damn thang, hit em' in the back of the
head, he dropped the wine  
But I caught him in time I had to take his life with a steak knife, I washed
it off and put it back  
I'm keepin' the place nice I'm comin bitch you want an olive or somethin' I'm
fuckin' straight out the  
Streets but I'm down with some frontin' I want to tango, but instead I'm still
outside the club and it's  
All in my head.  
  
[Chorus]
