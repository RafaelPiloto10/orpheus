Unsettled hearts  
Promise what they can't deliver  
Bring me the wine  
And the cold night air to clear my head  
Gray matter memory house  
Master of this trembling flesh  
Steady still my doubts  
Let me speak the word that precedes bliss  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
These weakened knees  
Have not touched ground or pew in ages  
I haven't bowed my head  
I offer thanks to any god or to ask for favors  
But watch me now  
I'm falling down  
Praying  
To speak the word that precedes bliss  
To speak the word  
To speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Love love love love love love love love  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word  
  
Let me speak the word  
Let me speak the word
