[Chorus: x2]  
You've got this strange effect on me  
And I like it  
  
You make my world in white  
You make my darkness bright, oh yes  
You've got this strange effect on me  
And I like it, and I like it  
  
And I like the way you kiss me  
Don't know if I should  
But this feeling it's love and I know it  
That's why I feel good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You make my world in white  
You make my darkness bright, oh yes  
You've got this strange effect on me  
And I like it, and I like it
