Roots Natty roots  
Dread Binghi dread  
I and I are the roots  
Some are leaf  
Some are branches  
I and I are the roots  
Some are the dry wood  
For the fire  
Whoa, Look at that  
They need a dry wood  
To cook their raw food  
Whoa, look at that  
Got to survive  
Inthis man maniac downpression  
Got to survive  
In iration  
They say roots Natty roots  
Dread Binghi dread  
I and I are the roots  
Some are wolf  
In sheep's clothing  
Whoa, look at that  
Many are called  
A few are chosen  
Whoa, look at that  
Nothing they can do  
To separate I and I  
From the love of our fathers  
You see, blood is thicker than water  
Whoa, look at that  
Got to survive  
In the ghetto  
Got to survive  
People ....
