I know what you're thinkin'  
what you're thinkin' is easy to see.  
I know what you're dreamin'  
I have those same dreams.  
Whoa...Reachin' to the feet of God.  
Lookin' for a sign.  
It was right here all the time, time, time, time...  
I am you and you are me.  
  
Do You believe? Don't you trust me? Me Wise Magic Ow! Baby it's all right.  
If you could see through my eyes, Me Wise Magic  
  
I feel you breathin' don't you trust me...(trust me)  
I feel you agreein' I know what you need (whoa)  
Don't you lie just you listen through me  
My words at best to you a fortune coo coo cookie  
(Who are you and where are we?)  
  
Do You believe? Don't you trust me? Me Wise Magic Yeah yeah! Woahohoh!  
If you could see See through my eyes, Me Wise Magic  
  
A little zen headed your way  
You'll get it halfway down the interstate  
Four days from now It all blows clear  
A Buddhist riff for your inner ear
