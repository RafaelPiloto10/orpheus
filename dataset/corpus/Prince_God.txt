In the beginning, there was God  
He made the earth, and the heavens  
He gave us light to rule the day  
And another light to rule the night  
  
The Lord, thy God  
Made, He made the seas  
He made the fruit upon the trees  
When He saw, when He saw that it was good  
  
He made a man, made a man  
Only He could, only He could  
God made you  
God made me too  
He made us all  
Made us all equally  
  
Now you say  
God made you  
God made me  
He made us all equally  
  
Wake up children  
Dance the dance electric  
There isn't much time  
Who screamed?  
Was it you?
