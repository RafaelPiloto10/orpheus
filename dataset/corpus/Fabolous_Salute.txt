First off I'm a muthafuckin'  
G-en-er-al word to the cake shells  
In this chopper will pop em  
Make it sound like a helli-choppers land on top of this bitch  
You want this whopper come and get your beef nigga  
I'm not a boxer I'm be brief nigga  
Were on top I will put you underneath niggas  
We will take your whole tribe and I'm the chief nigga  
Your highest title numero uno  
I'm not that little pregnant white girl but juno  
You no anything within a nigga reach  
My dogs will bite you and guess who the nigga leash  
I was once told by my nigga Meach  
You feed a sucka' he just grow to be a bigger leach  
So everytime you hear mine get your hand to your hairline  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah I'm in this bitch  
Sending champagne to my enemy's  
Salute or shoot you choose mu'fucka'  
Bow down till your head touch your shoes mu'fucka'  
Salute me, salute me, salute me, salute me  
Salute or shoot you choose mu'fucka'  
Bow down till your head touch your shoes mu'fucka'  
Salute me  
  
Now just say hello to the Captain  
And I stay away from magnets cause that metals what I'm packin'  
Bet your brains on your shirt will look like jello on a napkin  
And I promise my fellows will put your fellow on a canvas  
Call me Wezezy F baby Young Money army, betta' yet Navy  
Fab' I got 'em  
And watch me get 'em  
And I do 'em  
How I did 'em  
And tool inside my denim  
I shoot everything but woman and kids  
Bitch niggas stop bitchin' it's just how it is  
Now watch me let that sexy Nina kiss you by my ribs  
You won't be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib  
Shoot you in the stomach now your pissin' out your ears  
Hollygrove all day bodies in the hallway  
And if you come searchin' then your finding out the hard way (ugh)  
No matter where your from you better recognize a real  
Nigga when you see one  
Salute me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At second thought I got the heart of a solider  
Told ya I ain't gon' play y'all  
My mind has gon' awall  
Find it I will pay y'all  
My money is yay tall okay y'all  
A smidget stack is midget mack  
That mean it's gon' stay small  
Told dem I don't see nobody  
I'm a rappin' Ray Charles (I don't see nobody)  
I think I need a seein' I dog  
Come to being fly dog  
You ain't seeing I dog (OK OK OK OK)  
We sit in here like pollen now  
Fuck you niggas hollerin' now  
They said I been M-I-A  
Yea bitch I'm on columns now  
Leaders gon' be followin' crowds  
General like Colin Powell  
Water means Cary gay  
Beef is just a style of cow  
I who make the call  
So make me get the dialin' out  
Nick got the cannon yea dat nigga be widlin' out  
They ain't ballin' these niggaz is filin' out  
They ain't throwin' jives they just throwin' the towels out yea
