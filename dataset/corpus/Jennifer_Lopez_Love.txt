Think you gonna keep me iced, you don't  
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't  
If I wanna floss, I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
When you rolled up in the escalade  
Saw the dub you gave to the valet  
Knew that it was game when you looked at me  
Pullin' up your sleeve so I could see the rolley bling  
  
Saw you later in the corner booth  
Raisin' up a toast so I would notice you  
But your heart?s amiss  
Think you outta know  
Doesn't matter if you're ballin' out of control  
  
All that matters is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money can't buy yea  
  
Think you gonna keep me iced, you don't  
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't  
(Ooh)  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
When I took a chance  
Thought you'd understand  
(You)  
(Can't)  
Baby credit cards aren't romance  
So you're tryna' buy what's already yours  
(Understand)  
What I need from is not available in stores  
  
Seen a side of you that I really feel  
(You)  
(Feel)  
Doing way too much, never keep it real  
(Much)  
(Real)  
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road  
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?  
I've got to go  
  
All that matters is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money can't buy yea  
  
Think you gonna keep me iced, you don't  
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't  
(Baby)

My love don't cost a thing  
(Love don't cost a thing)

(Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing)  
  
Yea, yea, yea  
You think the money that you make  
(That you make)  
Can substitute the time you take  
(The time you take)  
Take the keys here to my heart  
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart  
(Oh ho)  
  
(Hey)  
I think you need to take some time  
To show me that your love is true  
(Ooh)  
There's more than dollar signs in you  
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart  
(My heart)  
  
Think you gonna keep me iced, you don't  
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing

If I wanna floss, I got my own
