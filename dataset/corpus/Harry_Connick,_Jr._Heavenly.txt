He's always smiling  
He never looks mean  
Even when the sun comes in between  
The man in the moon is smiling  
'cause he's in love  
The man in the moon is smiling  
'cause he's in love with the girl in the world  
  
She's there in the evening  
She never comes late  
All day she spins around  
But never makes him wait  
The girl in the world is smiling  
'cause she's in love  
The girl in the world is smiling  
'cause she's in love with the man in the moon  
  
When two heavenly bodies glow  
All the stars agree  
A planet might be born  
Maybe even a galaxy  
  
And in the morning  
They don't say good-bye  
But with a kiss  
They blend into the sky  
Oh, they're smiling  
'cause they're in love  
The man in the moon is smiling  
'cause he's in love with the girl in the world  
  
The man in the moon is smiling  
'cause he's in love with the girl in the world  
  
Heavenly!
