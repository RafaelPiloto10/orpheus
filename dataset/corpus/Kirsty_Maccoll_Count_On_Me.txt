When you do know what you don't know  
When you can't tell what you do know  
And it gets so very hard to see  
  
And if you weren't expecting trouble  
And I burst your little bubble  
Well I'm sorry babe, but you can count on me  
  
I know I get a little crazy sometimes  
I know you think I'm driving you out of my mind  
I know you love me and I don't make it easy but you can count on me  
  
You can count on me  
To do the wrong thing at the right time  
Say the right thing at the wrong time  
I have a hard time with my synchronicity  
  
And I know I should remember  
Never never lose my temper  
But you know it isn't easy being me  
  
I'm always early or too late  
I know I often make you wait  
I don't mean to get you in a state  
No you can count on me, darling  
You can count on me  
  
And if I seem to see the hours go so quick like summer flowers  
I have a problem with the bright side  
You can see  
So if I seem a little stateless sometimes  
Rest assured that I'm just unsure of just where I should be  
And don't mistake me for faithless no, no  
I promise you now you can count on, you can count on me  
  
And so I get a little crazy sometimes  
But there's so much of this world that I want to see  
And if you want to come with me now  
I won't let you down  
No, you can count on me
