When I say give me love well don't be meager  
Gee can't you see that I'm over eager  
Oh baby oh baby obey me  
And when my lonely arms need a build up  
Well get in my arms and keep them filled up  
Oh baby oh baby obey me  
Facts are facts and I'm mad about your caress  
So relax there's only one word for yes  
My love just lives for you why be lonely  
I want you for my one and only  
Oh baby oh baby obey me do  
Songs are writ to tell you what the lovers say  
And they're a hit when people believe that way  
So darling don't be shy don't be gentle  
'cause I want you close and continental  
Oh baby oh baby obey me  
No maybe hey baby you slay me  
Oh baby obey me do
