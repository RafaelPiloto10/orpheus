In...my...sensations  
I believe that I...was  
Born with the things that I know  
I want...to talk...  
Like ev'ry  
Before I decide what to do  
  
And I fell all over and I  
Couldn't stand up  
I can't be critical  
I can't won't stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Came to me come to me here it come...  
  
I'm...only...looking  
Feel like my heart  
Has a will of it's own  
I feel...feel nice inside  
Right here  
And now it's...summer again  
  
The story that I told  
The story I made up  
I was foolin' around but I  
Can't won't stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Come to me, come to me, here it come...  
  
This...boy...is in motion  
Some density  
Moved right beside me  
I want  
My sentence  
Right here  
But now I'm far away  
  
A sign was given but  
Many years have passed  
Cost a little bit to love you but I  
Won't can't stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Came to me come to me here it come...  
  
It's alright
