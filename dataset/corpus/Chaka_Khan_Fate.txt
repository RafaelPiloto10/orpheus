When you walked into my lonely life tonight  
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight  
And the moment I held you I knew it  
What we do is decided before we do it  
  
[Chorus]  
Fate, this could only be  
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in  
Fate, now I understand  
It's part of the plan  
I was meant to be your woman  
  
Time stood still, and we lost on words to say  
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away  
Oh we knew it was love we were feeling  
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In my heart I feel I've loved you all my life  
I was in the dark, but now I think I've seen the light  
I rang like a bell with your laughter  
Something tells me I'll love you forever and ever  
  
Fate (this could only be)  
It was fate (this could only be)  
It's part of the plan  
I was meant to be your woman  
(It's part of the plan)  
I'll love you forever and ever
