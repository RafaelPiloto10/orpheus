He's taking it hard she's taking it easy  
She's living it up and he's living it down  
He's walking the floor looking for answers  
She's out on the floor all over town  
  
Ain't that the way that love goes when love goes to pieces  
Ain't that the truth when you find out you're living a lie  
Ain't love the reason we both took a chance on each other  
Ain't it each other we both swore we wanted to try  
  
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy  
She's drying her eyes but his are still wet  
He wishes he could just hold her until she remembers  
She wishes she could find someone to make her forget  
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy
