I Live To Know You  
  
Standing in our presence,  
Lord, my heart and life are changed.  
Just to love You and to live to  
See Your beauty and Your grace.  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name,  
Nations rise up and seek Your face,  
And Your Kingdom is established,  
As I live to know You more.  
Now I will never be the same,  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed,  
And I'll forever sing- Your praise,  
I live to know You, Lord.  
I live to know You, Lord.  
  
You've called me, I will follow,  
Your will for me I'm sure.  
Let your heart beat feel my heart's cry  
Let me live to serve your call.  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name,  
Nations rise up and seek Your face,  
And Your Kingdom is established,  
As I live to know You more.  
Now I will never be the same,  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed,  
And I'll forever sing Your praise,  
I live to know You, Lord.  
I live to know You, Lord.
