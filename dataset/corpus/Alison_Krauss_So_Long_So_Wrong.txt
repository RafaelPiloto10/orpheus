I know I'll be lonesome  
That brings about a little fear  
I know I'll be sad and I'll be blue  
I have given the best of me  
When I forgot to say to you  
What you forgot to say to me  
So long, so wrong  
  
I have tried and cared, baby, it was never enough  
In your mind I never had a clue  
So I'll repave the same old road I'm on  
Where I forgot to say to you  
What you forgot to say to me  
So long, so wrong  
  
Did we take forever in vain  
Into the past  
Did we think forever was really gonna last  
  
You have tired me with your wanting ways  
You can't buy yourself to be complete  
I have given up caring anymore  
Once you were big in a world that's small  
And now you're all alone  
  
Have we taken forever in vain  
Into the past  
Did we think forever was really gonna last
