We sign our cards  
And letters BFF  
You've got  
A million way  
To make me laugh  
You're looking out  
For me  
You've got my back  
It's So good  
To have you around  
You know the secrets  
I could never tell  
And when I'm quiet you  
Break through my shell  
Don't feel the need  
To do a rebel yell  
Cuz you keep my feet  
On the ground  
  
You're a true friend  
You're here till the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Till it's alright again  
You're a true friend  
  
You don't get angry  
When I change the plans  
Somehow you're never out  
Of second chances  
You Won't say "I told you"  
When I'm wrong again  
I'm so lucky  
That I found  
  
A true friend  
You're here till the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
Till it's alright again  
  
True friends will go  
To the ends of the earth  
Till they find  
The things you need  
Friends hang on  
To the ups and the downs  
Cuz they got someone  
To believe in  
  
A true friend  
You're here 'til the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night,  
No need to pretend  
You're a true friend  
You're here 'til the end  
You pull me aside  
When somethin' ain't right  
Talk with me now  
And into the night  
'Til it's alright again  
  
You're a true friend  
You're a true friend  
You're a true friend
