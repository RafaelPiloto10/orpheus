Just hold me a little softly it's cold  
Hold me again  
'cause that's when our love is ageless and time, time is my friend  
  
So hold me closer, closer, closer baby that's what I need  
And you could lay your head on my dress  
And you could listen to my breathing, it's whispering  
  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know  
I just want to love you  
  
Remember, I once told you where not two of a kind  
Except I was chasing after something  
Love was the last thing on my mind  
  
And then you started, you started, started something inside of me, yeah  
So come on, lay your head on my dress  
And you could listen to my breathing, it's whispering  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know  
I just want to love you.
