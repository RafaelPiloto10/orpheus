Tell myself that I was doin' all right  
There's nothin' left to do tonight  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
Can't you see what you do to me baby,  
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac  
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick  
You're truly the only one who can do this to me  
You just make me get so crazy  
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic  
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit  
'Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We can't figure out if it's lust  
Or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch  
But I stay and still stick it out with you  
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it  
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just 'cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if there's one thing about you that I admire  
It's baby, because you stay with me  
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am  
'Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise  
You're always full of surprises  
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
You've always kept out of mine  
I wonder what's on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didn't see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral, the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do, and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter  
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable  
Is you're the legs to my table,  
If you were to break I'd fall on my face  
But I'm always gonna make you feel  
I don't need you as much as I really need you  
So you don't use it to your advantage  
But you're essential to me  
You're the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
I'd probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my Marshall  
You're the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my Eminem  
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that I'm lookin for  
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just won't come to my mind  
You're like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
You're like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough  
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go Crazy, crazy on you oh
