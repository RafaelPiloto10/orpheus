I've had my fun if I don't ever get well no more  
I've had my fun if I don't ever get well no more  
I know my health is failing me now  
I know I'm goin' down slow  
  
Won't somebody write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in  
I want somebody to writet my mother and tell her the shape I'm in  
I want you tell her to pray for me  
Ask her to forgive me for all my sins  
  
Mother please don't send me no doctor  
A doctor can't do me no good  
I don't want you to send me no doctor now  
A doctor just can't do me no good  
Back when I was a young boy oh  
I just didn't do the things I should  
  
Mmmm Mmmmmm  
Mmmm Mmmmmm
