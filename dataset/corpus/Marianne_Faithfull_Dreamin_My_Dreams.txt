I hope that I won't be that lone anymore  
Maybe I've learned this time.  
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for,  
The way that is easin' my mind.  
  
Some day I'll get over you,  
I'll live to see it all through,  
But I'll always miss  
Dreamin' my dreams  
With you.  
  
But I won't let it change me, not if I can,  
I'd rather believe in love.  
I'll give it away as much as I can  
To those that I'm fondest of.  
  
Some day I'll get over you,  
I'll live to see it all through,  
But I'll always miss  
Dreamin' my dreams  
With you.  
  
La, la la, la la la, la la,  
La la, la la, la la.  
La la la la, la la la la la,  
La la, la la, la la.  
  
Some day I'll get over you,  
I'll live to see it all through,  
But I'll always miss  
Dreamin' my dreams  
With you.  
  
But I'll always miss  
Dreamin' my dreams  
With you.
