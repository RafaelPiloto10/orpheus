First you say you're in love with me and that it lasts eternally.  
Then I find that you change your mind, but one and one will not make three.  
Well, I'm glad to say the distance is one thing I never mind.  
But every thought of leaving is the last thing on my mind.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
Everything that I've promised you,  
I tried and tried to make it all come true.  
But if I break your heart again, well this time it'll never mend.  
When I beg for freedom, you only chain me down.  
With everyday that passes now, the answer can't be found.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
All across the nation.  
People in frustration.  
There's those who need someone to stay.  
And those who've got to run away.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.
